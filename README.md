# ＢＯＴＴＰＡＤ

**oRIGINAL PROJECT DO NOT STEAL IF U STEAL I WILL COME TO UR ACCOUNT & CT YU**

A wattpad-trained rnn for making dumb videos to put on youtube

Very hacky, do not use.

renders with [Spectrum.py](https://github.com/Adjective-Object/Spectrum.py)

- symlink Spectrum.py from its real directory to `vidmaker`
- put images in `vidmaker/pics`
- put fonts in `vidmaker/fonts`

bottpad.sh needs to be run from the project root
build_epoch.t7 is a dumpfile from [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)

Something will probably break.
Spectrum.py is just bad in a lot of ways, so it _needs_ to be redone with
[cSpectrum](https://github.com/Adjective-Object/cSpectrum) once that's
minimally viable
