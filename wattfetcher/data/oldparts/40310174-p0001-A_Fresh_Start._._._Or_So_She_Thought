January 7th, Seven Years Ago
It had been officially six months since the day we got the phone call. My father and I dashed through the hospital door, my father screaming at the receptionist to let us see my mother. I remember the woman telling my father to calm down, and that my mother was in critical condition after being hit head on by a wrong way driver in broad daylight.
I was 13 at the time, and I could still feel the tears gushing down my face after hearing those dreadful words come from the doctor's mouth.
"I'm sorry, there is no easy way to say this. I'm afraid Mrs. Victoria Martin didn't make it."
Mrs. Victoria Martin didn't make it.
My mother didn't make it.
I could still remember freezing, and trying to pretend that I never heard it. But it was unavoidable. I could still see the horror on my father's face, and seeing him drop to his hands and knees in despair.
"She's gone," he barely whispered. My heart was torn to shreds in that moment. Other people near us came over trying to console us, but it just wasn't possible. I could still feel the cold depression creeping over me.
How could she have left so soon? I still needed her, we still needed her. I couldn't possibly live without my mother. Later, we were allowed to see my mother's body. She was absolutely unrecognizable. Her face plastered with dry blood, that heartwarming beautiful smile completely gone. Those loving, warm eyes, suddenly blank.
I couldn't look at her five seconds before burying my face in my father's chest, sobbing uncontrollably, my father doing the same. It was like this for months. My father and I only had each other left, and we lived off of each other. Our pain had no difference. After all, he was the only one I had left.
I didn't really have many friends, and I wasn't the most liked person, so having no friends to help you out really does impact how you recover. I guess I never will recover at all.
We had just gotten back from winter break, and most girls came back tanned (keep in mind it's winter) with brand new clothes and they think back to school means see your friends.
To me it means deal with the guy who's entire life must revolve on making my life miserable. That morning was the same as any other morning. Get up, brush my teeth, shower, wash my dull dark hair, and try and rid my brown skin of acne by just staring at it. I just put my hair a ponytail and dressed myself in the usual loose sweatshirt, black dress pants, and black sneakers.
Nothing special. Of course when it came to me nothing was ever special. I'm pretty sure I lost a bit of my novelty when I lost my mother. I wasn't always so quiet and emotional. I used to have a small group of three friends. But I separated myself from them after sixth grade. That was a mistake. After exiting my room, I froze seeing some random lady sleeping on the couch.
Oh, that must be what dad dragged in after getting drunk off his ass last night. It was like that almost every weekend. My dad would come home absolutely wasted at 3 in the morning making out with some whore he met in a bar or something. He refused to admit alcohol and women were what he used to forget about my mom. It hurts seeing my dad with someone other than my mother.
Watching your father betray your passed mother multiple times isn't the easiest thing to do. If I try and do something about it, I know I'll fail, just like all the other times. As I neared the couch, I saw the sleeping whore had no clothes on and the thing that was covering her bare rear end was one of our pillows.
Ew.
I saw her clothes on the floor and smirked to myself. Picking them up as if it was dog crap, I opened the door to our yard and accidentally dropped them into the garbage bin. Maybe I didn't lose all of my humor. Now came the hard part of my day. Reed Warren. The source of a lot of my pain.
