I haven't spoken to him in ages.. He never ignores me like this, what could be wrong?. Ritsuka won't speak to me, did I do something wrong?.... When I don't hear his voice, when I don't see his face.. It makes it hard to get through life. It makes my heart break when I can't do anything, it makes me feel alone and unwanted. I wish I knew what was going on, but he won't tell me... I will go insane if I don't get answers, I yearn to know why my Sacrifice will not talk to me. I'm Struggling.
