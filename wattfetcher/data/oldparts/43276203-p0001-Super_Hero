Hi my name is Nichole Kate Zambrano but my friends call me Nickky or Skate. I am 15 and I was born in New Jersey but moved when I was a baby, not sure why my mom never told me but I only asked once and she freaked out. I live with my mom only, my dads in mexico. I have 2 younger sisters, Jamie is 10 and Aisha is 8 and a 4 year old baby brother named Hazel. I love to skate, play volleyball, go on walks, draw and write in a jornal i have hidden in my closet. I also LOVE DOGS I have a husky, his name is spike. He has dark baby blue eyes and likes to play around a lot and thats all there is to it.
