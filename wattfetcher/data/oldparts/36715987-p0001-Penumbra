A/N: Apologies for the really bad blurb; I had the synopsis written out and perfect, but you can't put a synopsis on a story. :/ Still working on making this okay for readers.
This should be out after Frostbitten is finished, (so around May or June) and I may post a teaser eventually. Not sure, though. This is going to be a really hard book to write, but I'm up for the challenge. :)
So, this is a Beauty and the Beast/The Fairy Snake retelling, but there will be many (more like a few) differences.
Cover is made by me and I don't know how I feel about it. I'll eventually get a new one. Eventually.
