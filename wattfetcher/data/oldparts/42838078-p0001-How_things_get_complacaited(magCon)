My name is Dylan. Yes I have a boy name. But I love it ,even if people make fun of me for it. I am 16 I will be 17 on September 13th. Anyway my mom wants me to have a social life and actually talk to people. Who does that.
"So Dylan, guess what?" Another atempt to get me to talk to people.
"What is it now mom" I say. She gave me that sweet smile the EVIL smile. I hate it. "Well I am good friends with Gina camron Dallas mom. And I got he to let you go to magcon with her son." I knew she was up to some thing EVIL . EVIL MOTHER.
"Mom why you know I don't like traveling.
" well look on the bright side traveling with nine boys and their girlfriends" Right most of them have girlfriends so what's the point.
" well Dylan you have no choice because while you on vacation I'll be in London i always wanted to go there" I go upstairs and start packing . swim suit, 10 pairs of shorts ,5pajama pants , 14 shirts ,books ,phone ,laptop, tablet. I'm done here . I smell PIZZA.
"MOMMY DID YOU ORDER PIZZA!"I run down stairs and grab a whole box and run back upstairs run into my room and lock the door. I put on the best song stitches by Shawn mendes. Deep down inside I am super happy to meet the guys. I actually think that their all super cute especially Sammy and Matt and shawn.  And they are all single witch is lucky for me. Not that I think I'm gonna get lucky and get one of them. In my head I'm ugly annoying and a whole bunch of other words. Mom said were leaving in two days. So I'm gonna go to bed now to speed things up a bit.
-morning-

" hey dill since today is our last day together for a while umm we're gonna hang out go for ice cream watch  a movie ya know. Stuff. " moms weird.
