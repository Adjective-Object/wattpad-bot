"WHAT?" Naruto yelled. "Iruka-sensei, why the hell are you saddling such an excellent shinobi such as myself with THAT LOSER? And Kotone!"
"Yes, Naruto-kun?" Shadow asked sweetly, and Naruto decided to not say what he had in mind.
"Why do Kotone and I have to be with that slug?"
"Hn. Just don't drag me down, dobe." Sasuke muttered.
"WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?" Naruto shouted.
"Hard of hearing?" Sasuke taunted.
"Naruto, Sasuke had the second highest scores in the class. Kotone had the highest. And you, Naruto, you had the worst." The class laughed.
"Losers." Shadow muttered. Sasuke looked at her, the mysterious girl who outscored him on their tests. Who was she?
The answer: well, she was the Hesshoku, but they don't need to know that.
"EVERYONE SHUT UP!" Iruka yelled. "Team 8 will be Hyuuga Hinata, Inuzuka Kiba, and Aburame Shino. Team 9 is Haruno Sakura, (insert random name here), and (insert random name here)."
"WHAT?" Sakura yelled. "Iruka-sensei, I'm supposed to be with Sasuke-kun! Not these two losers!" She gestured to her two teammates.
"Tough luck." Shadow muttered. Sakura glared at her.
"Iruka-sensei, it's not fair that Kotone gets to be with Sasuke-kun." Ino complained. "Some of us have worked hard to get him to love us!"
"YOU KNOW WHAT?" Shadow roared, standing up. "I'M TIRED OF ALL YOUR CRAP! LIFE'S NOT FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME EITHER! DO YOU REALLY THINK I WANT TO BE TEAMED WITH THE HYPERACTIVE IDIOT AND THE EMO? WELL I DON'T! SO SHUT YOUR TRAPS AND SIT DOWN!"
Everyone sat down, quivering with fear.
Iruka coughed. "Okay, Team 10 is Nara Shikamaru, Yamanaka Ino, and Akimichi Choji."
"WHAT?" Ino yelled, but sat back down when Shadow looked at her.
"Good, we've got everyone, yes?" Iruka asked. "Well then, you're dismissed for lunch!"
Everyone rushed outside, yelling. Shadow followed them slowly.
"Hey Kotone?" Naruto asked. "I was wondering, if, y'know, now that we're on the same team, if you wanted to sit and have lunch together?"
Shadow looked at him coolly. Just as Naruto turned away, muttering Sorry,
"Okay." He looked at her, confused.
"I'll eat lunch with you." She explained. Naruto's face brightened up instantly.
"Really?"
Shadow shrugged. "I've nothing better to do."

"Kotone-chan, can I sit with you?" Naruto asked excitedly. Shadow turned her head away.
"I'd rather you didn't."
"But we've been waiting for hours!"
"I know."
"Hn. Losers."
Shadow stood up, slamming her palms onto the desk. "Alright, y'know what? I am so tired of all your antics! Sasuke, you need to understand that some people have had it a lot worse than you. Naruto has the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him, and he's been ostracized and beaten down by the village all his life. But look at him! Still smiling! Why can't you two just GET ALONG?"
