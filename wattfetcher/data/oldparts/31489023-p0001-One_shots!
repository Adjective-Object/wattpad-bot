This is from the story I wrote before, and all I did was change the ship!👌-------------------------------------------------Nash's POV•I woke up to Cam yelling... "Come on Nashy get up!!!!" He whined. "Why?" I ask, "because all the boys are down stairs and we're gonna play truth or dare. And I know you don't want to miss it because it your favorite game!" Can stated, "fine but don't start until I'm ready" I told him. "Yayyy!!!!!!, thanks nashy" he yelled then kissed my cheek and left the room. When he left I couldn't help but touch the cheek his lips once lingered on. But I'm not even gay! I thought to myself, at least that's what I thought....Cam's POV•Man it's so boring right now I wish Nash would hurry up. Then as if on cue Nash walked in the room and yelled "who's ready to play truth or dare with the master?!" And everyone started busting out laughing. After we all got settled down again Aaron finally asked "ok so who wants to go first?...", "Ohhhh I wanna go first, me pick me!!" Jj basically screamed. "Ok JJ you can go first" Aaron chuckled, "ok so can truth or dare" he asked me while smirking evily. "Dare" I said proudly, "ok I dare you to kiss... Nash!". After those last few words slipped off his tongue I wanted to kill him. He was the only person I told about my crush on Nash! I mean I trusted him. Plus how could you not like Nash? I mean with his gorgeous eyes, soft hair, perfect body... Ok never mind your  getting off track Cameron keep it together!Nash's POV•I looked over at Cam to see that he was deep in thought but that's didn't last for long because 5 seconds later he came and sat in my lap and started to slowly lean in and when are lips met it was like a volcano erupted in my stomach. But when we pulled apart he asked the question I've been longing to hear, "boyfriends?" "Boyfriends".-----------------------------------------------Hope you enjoyed my first one shot?!?!
