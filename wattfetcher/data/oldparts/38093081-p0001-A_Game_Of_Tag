I held onto the S shaped pendant around my neck that was given to me from my mother.

Glimmering tiny diamonds were surrounding the small baby pink diamond rose in the center of the S shaped necklace.

Shining in the elegant moonlight, dangling in several directions from the speed my tiny legs can run.

I inhaled and exhaled fast, gasping for air desperately.

Fearing of the approaching eerie sounds in the distant I grunted in pain from running.

My jaws clenched together tightly as I speeded up my pace at running in the woods without looking back.

The night lit by the moonlight was beautiful, breathtaking.

It was no time to admire the moon, I'm hurt, chased, alone, scared.

I grunted once again clutching my hands up to my chest.

"Ughhh" I grunted slowing down my pace, hiding behind a tree.

"I think I lost them" I whispered to myself.

"it hurts so badly" I shut my light blue crystal like colored eyes.

My wavy beach blonde hair was waving in The wind. I gulped realizing I was thirsty from all that running for half an hour.

Scanning the woods I was lost, my eyes stopped searching as it stared at a lake not far from where I was.

I could see the lake reflecting the beautiful moonlight.

Walking towards the lake I knee down to look at my reflection.

I gasped at the sight, I was a mess. My blonde shoulder lenght hair was like my bed hair when I woke up, which was a complete nightmare to me.

My eyes were forming black circles underneath my eyes which were red and puffy from crying

The corners of my baby pink lips were making a frown.

"It's not fair" I whispered to myself laying on the soft green grass. Embracing my knees with my two arms as I lay my head on my knees.

"I've...I've" I felt my lip quivering from my stupid emotional feelings.

"Lost every thing"

"it's not fair!" I shouted making my arms tightly embraced my legs.

'What if he heard me shout?' Thinking of the thought I shivered.
