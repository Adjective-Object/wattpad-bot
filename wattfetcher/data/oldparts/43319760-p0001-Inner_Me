Kati is short for a name she hates so much. So she likes to be called KitKat...
But deep inside she loves Sunset Destiny Ride, because it makes her feel strong.
She has some similarities to Destiny, but the powers are fake. She only has a few talents from her: her singing and her strong feelings for family and friends
Kati has different sides, and is like a multi-personality girl.
She likes Evil and Good, is Shy and dynamic, loves indoors and outdoors,
But there are heard times, when Kati feels vulnerable and lonely, so she hides it all. And even though she has siblings...she tends not to tell them, because its so hard
So she thinks to herself "PULL URSELF TOGETHER!" and she made a goal to not cry at all, only when she was alone.
