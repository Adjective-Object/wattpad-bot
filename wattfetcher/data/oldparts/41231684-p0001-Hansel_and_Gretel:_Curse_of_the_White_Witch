"Hansel!" I called running down the forest to our house. I marched inside the house looking for Hiccup around, but he's not here.
"Hansel!" I called again running out of the house and to the deep forest. My feet were stomping on the forest floor, making loud thumps because of my leather boots. "Hansel!"
Suddenly, something pounced on me making me roll on the forest floor. I hear chuckling of a familiar voice. I look up and saw a pair of emerald green eyes, with a very charming smile.
Suddenly, his lips was pressed on mine, giving me a short soft kiss. "Miss me?" He asked. I roll my eyes pushing him off me.
"No silly." I hissed. "Were being called by the Mayor, we got mail." I replied brushing my sleeve. "What mail?" Hiccup asked as he ruffles his hair, removing the dost off.
"We got invitation from a village, witches are reigning again." I replied. Hiccup and I started walking back our way to the village of Augsburg. "Well, I gotta go get the team ready." Hiccup said. "Go, I'll prepare the weapons and stuff we need for the trail." I said running my way to our house.
We decided to live in our old house, we don't want to live with the mayor and his flirty daughters, well we don't want to bother them, so we decided to live here instead, we fixed it and made it even stronger.
I went inside to our old bedroom, where we sleep and keep our weapons. I went to my bed and open the trunk where my guns, and blade weapons are hidden. And I get Hiccup's weapons and some of his clothes.
I place them in separate bags, I searched through the cabinets to find some things we can use. I saw a the amulets that Hiccup and I had been wearing for years. I quickly grab it from its place and wore my sapphire colored one and placed it in my pocket. When I'm ready I swung the two bags over my shoulders and ran out of the house, locking the door and ran my way to the village.
