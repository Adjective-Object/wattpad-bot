Clary POV
I wrapped my black pea coat tighter around my body and shivered as the cold air bit at my face. I looked behind me and almost bumped into a man walking towards the Institute. I quickly opened the doors and walked towards the elevator and waited for it to reach the Institute's first floor not counting the church. When the doors opened I stepped out and walked towards the library where Maryse had told me to meet her. A message had arrived from the Seelie Court and I was mentioned.
"Clary, you are here just in time, a messenger has just arrived but refused to tell us what he needed until you got here." I stared confused and looked at the messenger. He was obviously Fae by his emotionless eyes and his cold beauty. He had long blonde hair and spring green eyes, enhanced by his tan complexion. "Lady Clarissa, my Queen wishes to have a meeting with you and only you. I was sent to escort you to the gate to my realm." I looked towards Maryse and she nodded.
"Clary, you must go. Remember the Fae's conditions and their...'ways'." Maryse said gently. Jace, Isabelle, and Alec all started arguing about me going alone. Maryse nodded at me and the messenger and I slipped out of the room. When we left the Institute he led me to one of New York's many parks. He stopped when we reached a large Weeping Willow and placed his now glowing palm on the tree. He chanted Fae language that I could surprisingly understand now. I gasped as stairs looked to be forming in a spiral staircase around the tree base. He motioned me forward and I followed nervously.
When we reached the bottom I looked around the large hallways made of dirt lined with trees. I heard laughter and music and followed the messenger as he led me past many doors and branching corridors. I saw a bright light in front of us and the hallway branched into a large room lit with a chandelier made of icicles dangling from the ceiling. I stared in awe at the ice covered walls and the room in general.
The Seelie Queen seemed to be amused at my awe and motioned me towards her Ice throne. I walked forwards and she spoke in her melodic voice "Dear, dear Clarissa, how grand to see you again! I have summoned you to stay with us until your eighteenth birthday. You are one of the most esteemed Shadowhunters and it would be an honor to have you in my court for a few days. Do you accept, Clarissa?"
I really did not want to stay but I had a strange urge to say yes so I said "I would be honored, your grace."
She smiled and motioned a person from behind her that I recognized as Meliorn. He smiled at me and motioned for me to follow. I did and he led me to a large wooden door carved with flowers, birds, vines, and trees. It was beautiful but I was even more in awe at the rooms (Yes, I said rooms!) that I was given.
The first room had a large Victorian cream settee against one wall and a fireplace opposite. There was two forest green chairs around the fireplace. The fireplace had a picture of what looked to be a forest with a redheaded girl in a Victorian looking dress walking down a winding path. There was a crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling and cast a warm glow around the room. Their was a cherry wood coffee table in front of the settee and small cherry wood tables next to the two arm chairs. It was beautiful but the bedroom was absolutely breathtaking!
A curved doorway led into the bedroom with a sheer forest green curtain covering as a door. A gigantic cherry wood four-poster bed was pushed against the right wall and there was a large Victorian chaise lounge pushed against the bottom of the bed and the bed had forest green silk sheets and a lot of pillows and little throw pillows. There was another fireplace against the left wall with a large detailed mirror carved with flowers and intricate Celtic looking knots.
