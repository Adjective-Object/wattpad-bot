"You guys be careful out there and Brad take the back door key incase it gets too cold and you want to come back and-" Brad's mom shouted. "Lock the tree house door." She shouted again.
"Will do mom." Brad looked at me smiling. "Now can we go?" He shouted back through to his mom whilst walking over the a cupboard and getting out a pack of pop corn and walking back over to me.
"Yeah." I heard Brad's mom shout.
"Come on Loz." Brad said opening the door. "You first." He smiled politely. I walked outside the coldish air hitting my arms and waving my straight blonde hair back and fourth. I looked behind me to see Brad locking the back door with the set of the cars.
"Lead the way." I smiled, Brad started to walk in the direction of the tree house.

I sat on the blanket next to Brad reading one of this comics with him.
"I love this part." I shouted. Brad and I had read this comic loads and we knew every single part.
"Me too." Brad smiled.
After a few more pages were turned we had finished the comic and Brad chucked it to the side of the tree house.
"I think it's time to go to sleep." I said yawning.
"I agree." Brad said smiling. I laid my pillow next to Brad's as he did and pulled the blanket over me. I turned to face Brad. He looked at me and kissed my cheek.
"Ew Brad, that's what mom's and dad's do." You said laughing and wiping your cheek with tot hand in a playful way.
"We could be a mom and dad one day, you know." Brad said smiling.
"And then we could be best friends for ever." I snuggled up to him. "It's so cold."
"I'll keep you warm." Brad placed an arm around me. "Goodnight Loz." Brad whispered, half a sleep.
"Good night Brad, sweet dreams."
