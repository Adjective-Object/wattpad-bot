So the new quest in your new home was finding the town's grocery store and a half decent place to eat. This gave you a chance to explore the town and get a good feel of the residents. You had a map given to you awhile back after you had decided to move to gravity falls. You pulled it out and scouted out a course of action, the grocer's, straight home, then picking out a fine cheap meal. There was only going to be enough money to last to the end of the summer. Finding a job was another mandatory task you had.
You sighed, pushing back your negative thoughts and thinking of the positives. Things should only get good from here on out. After all, play your cards right and you'll probably be living here for the next 70 years of your life.
Nope! Nope! Nope! You shook your head and took a deep breath of the hot summer air and exhaled. You wouldn't have any more troubles and could worry just about living in the quiet, woodland town of Gravity Falls.
