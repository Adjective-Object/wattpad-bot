Hi. My name is Margo Delta and this is my story.I was never a real tall girl or  motional stable. I got along with almost everyone but some teachers didn't like me and I didn't know why. I was a shy quiet girl with brown hair and green eyes.  My style is like sweet and smart.I rarely talked or raised my hand in class,but that all changed when I met him. Him. I still get chills when I think about him. Who is this 'him' you ask? Why he is Hunter William. My best friend. Hunter is a tall,smart, basketball player (captain). He has hazel eyes and dirty blond hair, he's style is a mix of a lot of things. We are complete opposites,but I guess we blend better that way. Hunter is like a player but that's what you get when your the most popular guy in school. He has an on-again off-again relationship with Dana Bright. Don't get fouled by her last name, that girls a monster. She may look perfect on the outside but deep down she evil. How do I know this u say? Well you'll find out soon. Anyways that all you need to know to get you going. Maya:Hey what about me? Me: Opps! Sry Maya!ðŸ˜…. Ok so that girl is Maya Young my  other Best friend. She has red hair and a short temper. She's like a bad girl, like she almost never does her home work (unless I force her to). Her style is like Edgy but sporty. She like to play soccer and shop. Me:Is that everything? Maya:Yes,I'm good now! Me:ok then that's all u need to know to start u off!
