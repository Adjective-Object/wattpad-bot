I pulled on my black vans and quick checked myself in the mirror before i left. My jean shorts and figure fitting white crop top looked nice with my braided ombre hair. I had always loved ombre and when i was 15 my mom finally let me get it. Its two years later, i have had it ever since.
Deciding that i looked presentable, i grabbed my phone, black bag and called out to my mom, "Im meeting Page and Cameron for coffee need me to pick up anything for dinner while I'm out?"
"Oh no, I'm fine dear. Have a good time and be safe! Love you Talley!" She responds.
"Love you too, bye!" I yell back as i grab my keys from the bowl by the entrance and close the door on my way out. I run over to my parked car and jump inside. I haven't seen either Page or Cameron since school ended and we went to this huge party. Page has stayed home but busy with babysitting, Cameron has been in New York visiting his older sister and i just returned from the beach where i got a tan that they'll both fawn over.
They were my best friends since middle school began. We were all new to the area and nobody talked to any of us. Things have changed drastically, i wouldn't say we were a popular group but we were often involved in some of the parties and school drama. But although there was rumors and gossip, the three of us were always there for each other, through everything. No matter what happened in school. To say i'd missed seeing them was an understatement. There was only a few more weeks until summer would come to a close.
When i arrived i saw that none of them were there yet. So i got in line and ordered a coffee. Some people liked those sugary coffees with the crazy names but i liked to stick to the basics. No sugar. No milk. Plain and black. Just the smell of the shop gave me shivers.
As i waited for my drink i saw another man standing against the wall, i presume also waiting for his order. He was tall, handsome with dark long locks that were full of waves, and wore dark skinny jeans and a loose fitting top. I took my lip into my teeth as i looked at the man. Seconds later his eyes rose up and glanced at me: catching me red handed staring at him. I blushed and looked away but i could almost feel him smirk as he watched the side of my neck.
Some girls my age would have the confidence to walk over to him and try to get his phone number, but i was not one of those girls... Typically. If it wasn't a dare, then i wasn't majorly outgoing. However i did have the tendency to surprise myself, though i doubted this would be one of those times. I thought he would look away from me eventually but he hadn't. So i turned back to him, "staring isn't polite you know." I commented, maybe i would give it a go... What could go wrong anyway? Its not like i was ever going to see him again.
Just think of it as practice
His lips curved upward before replying in a deep British tone, "i only stare at people who spark my interest." A coffee was put out and the man grabbed it slowly. He whispered, "and you know, staring is a compliment, thats why i didn't say anything when you did it to me."
I slightly blushed,
Practice, he's just practice.
With lack of anything to say i asked him a question, "Whats your name?"
His dark eyes flicked up to mine sending my stomach in loops, "Harry, Harry Styles... But its Daddy to you." And then, as if he wasn't there to begin with, he was gone.
Just then Cameron and Sage walk in laughing. Then they see me and run over in my direction. "TALLYYYY!!" Page screams, as she engulfs me in a hug. Squeezing me until i felt my lungs start to shake. Then she holds me back and inspects me, "You got tan!" She exclaims and we laugh as i bring Cameron in for a hug. He also notices and decides to speak, "ok ok we know that the beach was amazing but tell me, how were the boys?" He asks.
