"Oh, yeah? Then I'm not going. Have fun with my girlfriend." Juuzou said with a click of tongue.
"Um..Let's eat pancakes!" I awkwardly laughed, scratching the back of my head.
Juuzou clicked his tongue again, "I'll pass." he said as he walked to his bedroom, slamming the door.
I sighed, then turned to Kou.
"I'm sorry but, I can't go to the festival anymore."
"Eh, it's okay. Go and make up with him." Kou said as he exited the apartament.
I sighed once again, heading over Juuzou's bedroom.
"Can I come in?"
An unclear "Whatever." was heard. I opened the door to find Juuzou playing with his stitches.
"Are you done whoring around with that brat?" He coldly said, staring at me with dull eyes.
"What are you talking about?" I asked, taken back by his comment. It made my heart stung and it made my whole body freeze in the spot, he never said such things to me, and this unfamiliar feeling of heartache and numbness was new to me, and not enjoyable at all.
"How many times have you fucked until now? How many times did you held hands, went on dates, hugged, kissed with him?" He rose up from the bed, took my wrists and pinned them on the wall, his face dangerously close to mine, his hot and unsteady breath hitting me. My eyes widened and filled with tears. I felt like passing out, more and more pain brought to my heart with each second his icy eyes pierced mine. His slender hands held mine with force and his gritted teeth made clear that he was mad, no, he was furious. I didn't knew how to react. That's when he yelled, "Don't cry, stupid! Tell me!" making me flinch.
"W-what are you talking about?" I asked once more, biting my lip after to block the tears that were almost falling. He released my wrists, rubbed his temples and turned around, his back facing me.
"Get out." he quietly said. this made my heart stung more and more, my head hurt more and more, my body filling with more and more numbness. I couldn't move, I couldn't think straight. This was our first big fight, yes, we fought over other things but it ended with one of us apologizing after, this time, it wasn't the same. "Are you deaf? I said get out!"
I couldn't take it anymore. I balled my fists, gave my tears a free run over my cheeks and hid my face with my hair. "I hate you, Suzuya Juuzou!" I yelled at him, raising my head from the ground and with blurry sight I glanced at him one more time, noticing his widened eyes, then stormed off the bedroom, almost running to guest room. I spent all my night crying myself to sleep and remembering over and over his words. "How many times did you fucked with him?", "Are you done whoring around with that brat?"

It was finally morning, my hair was a mess, my eyes were puffy and my cheeks red from all the hours of crying. I didn't planned to get out of this room, but I really needed a shower.
I opened the door, looking from left to right. My eyes widened as I saw Juuzou sleeping on the floor, in front of the door.
"What are you doing here? Wake up and go to bed." I said, shaking him. Even though he hurt me, I still had the right to care about him.
"Huh?" he asked, rubbing his eyes. As soon as he saw me, his hands went to my neck bringing me to his chest, then rolled on top of me.
"Rikka-chan!" he yelled, looking at me with a big smile on your face. I blinked several times, he was not the Juuzou from yesterday.
