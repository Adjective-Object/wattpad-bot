"Well, meet me on the roof." Kakashi said, disappearing in a puff of smoke.
Shadow growled and melted into shadows. Homura flashed a peace sign and disappeared. Sasuke and Naruto exchanged glances and trudged out the door.

"So, you're Shadow, huh?" Kakashi asked once Shadow appeared.
Shadow glared at him. "I don't like you."
"Well that's too bad. I'm your sensei." Kakashi chuckled.
"You forget. I am Hesshoku. I have no sensei." Shadow said coldly.
"Then how is it that you were assigned to my team?"
"Kura and Homura. They made me come here, but I am not afraid to kill you. Konoha wouldn't even dare to wage war."
Kakashi flinched, despite himself. She was scary.
"Shadow-chan!" Naruto yelled, rushing toward her. Shadow looked at him curiously. No one had ever knew her real identity and yet called her chan, besides Homura and Kura.
Kakashi coughed. "Alright team, why don't we introduce ourselves?"
"Team?" Shadow scoffed. "I doubt it."
"What's that supposed to mean, Shadow-chan?" Naruto asked.
"I'm Hesshoku. I don't need to be dragged down by any of you." She turned to face Naruto and Sasuke and smiled. "I'm sorry... I'll help you both reach your goals. But I refuse to be put on a team."
"Wait, Shadow-chan, it sound like you're leaving!" Naruto looked panicked. Shadow shook her head.
"Nope, I'm not leaving you two. I admit, you two brats have got some pretty interesting goals, and I always like to help people reach their goals. But I'm not staying on this team."
"Then who's going to be your replacement? Please no fangirls." Sasuke muttered.
"I don't know. Maybe I could talk to the Hokage about this..." Shadow smirked and disappeared.
*** A FEW DAYS LATER ***
There was still no word from Shadow. Naruto and Sasuke were getting along much better, and yet Kakashi was still torturing them with D-Ranks.
"Alright team! Except Kakashi!" Sasuke and Naruto looked in sync to see the familiar black-haired girl sitting in a tree. "I talked to the Hokage, and he agreed that I could remain on your team-"
"YAY!" Take a wild guess.
"-, and on the plus side, I don't have to do any of the D-Ranks!" Shadow gave a closed-eye smile.
"WAIT, WHAT? THAT'S SO NOT FAIR!" And again.
"I am Hesshoku, Naruto, it's only natural."
"You seem to enjoy rubbing this Hesshoku thing in our faces." Sasuke observed.
"Aww man, you caught me." Shadow grinned and jumped down from the tree. "I'll admit, Homura was right. I am having fun."
"That's so good to hear." Kakashi muttered sarcastically.
"Actually, Kakashi-sensei, we are glad to hear that." Sasuke said.
"Yeah! Shadow-chan's our friend!" Naruto defended her. Shadow smiled.
"So let's get started!"
"Huh?" Naruto asked.
"The sooner we get these D-Ranks done, the sooner we can move onto C-Ranks." Shadow explained. Naruto grinned.
