Lennon Porters had a normal perfect life until her father passed away. Hurt both mentally and physically by her brothers, the only thing that could bring her happiness was her mate.
On the night of Sebastian birthday party and receiving the title of being Alpha, Lennon sleeps with him. Her wolf, who she hasn't been in contact with for three years, tells her he is her mate. He ends up rejecting her because she is too weak.
Finding hope in a necklace that her father gave to her, the necklace gives her a chance to have a new life away from her brothers with the help of her father's old best friend. Pregnant with triplets and living the human life that she prefers over the werewolf world.
You don't know what you have until it's gone...
A/N: Thank you SO much Sharpicle. She made the awesome cover. It looks absolutely adorable. Please do me a favor and check her out! Follow her and vote for her books.]

Please note: I feel like I've grown more mature from the time I began this book. I will be going back and changing alot of stuff once I've completed the book. Sometimes I go back and read it and think I was very ignorant for writing it...

But give the book a chance :)
