I look up at Simon to see him waiting for the coffees. A girl with blonde hair is standing next to him. She's chatting with him, but his eyes stay with mine. My mouth turns up in a smile and i slip the ring on. He soon comes back with two hot coffees. He places one in front of me, then sits across from me.
"Thank you. For the ring, it's beautiful." I state with a smile.
"No problem. It's your birthday after all." he replies. I roll my eyes and take a sip of my coffee.
"Now tell me, why didn't you ask that girl out?" I question.
"What girl?" He asks.
"The one standing next to you in line? She was totally checking you out!" I reply.
"I'm saving myself for someone else. It wouldn't be fair." he shrugs.
"Who? I know all of your friends, because they happen to be my friends too. So who are you saving yourself for?" I ask.
"It doesn't matter." he replies just as the first poet climbs on the small stage.
