My dad told me something once.
"If there's ever anything good on SiFi, it's going to get canceled."
That's what happened to one of my favorite shows.
Sanctuary.
I was furious when it was canceled, and I've re-watched it many times since then. It almost seems like it gets better each time I see it, which only infuriates me more that they canceled it.
If they were running out of ideas, they could have consulted the fans. It's not illegal you know. I believe that's the only reason Doctor Who has been running so long.
I have yet to meet someone other than my own mother that is as infuriated as I am over this (Or even seen the show, in fact.)
Tell me I'm not alone, here!
