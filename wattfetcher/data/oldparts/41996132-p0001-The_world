The boy and the girl that don't get along because of differences. Not race and not sex, but power. The natural powers that they have. Not taken away from someone and given to them, but born with it. Powers that will kill the other, grow hatred over the other, and team against the other.
The world changes frequently. Like people. When the world makes a mistake, all hell breaks loose. Power can save people and kill people. But that's what power does.
Elise. The girl with icy thoughts and a non forgiven, cold heart. Full of lyrics and book quotes. Never in love. Colourblind- confined to only black and white. Never seen colour and the vivid sunsets. Elise keeps secrets to herself, not telling anyone. She doesn't trust her family or anyone for that matter.
Ryan. The boy with the fire in his eyes and a brave brain. Never thinking twice and gets in trouble a lot. He trusts the wrong people, telling drug dealers his address and newspaper reporters secrets getting them into the newspaper. He's confined to a wheelchair due to the lack of legs when he was born. Never being able to have the joy of walking freely without someone behind him.
Elise and Ryan are different from the rest of their schoolmates but don't stick together against them. No one knows their secrets, not even each other. Ice, cold and solid. Fire, hot and gives off gas. Ice and fire do not match, or so they say.
What happens when they get put together? Will things get worse, or save everyone?
