Her theory isn't wrong. In fact, I can imagine them, back on the cargo trains, gassing them or accidentally crashing them. Right now, there could be executions happening, and a lot of people dying because of sneaking out of the wall or because of the population.
I mean, just imagine building a wall surrounding five states, and fitting the entire country in them. And three of them are barely a third of that state.
I hear the same thing in these towers that I do in my own bed. I hear the same cries of the ongoing Insurrectionists and military fighting. I hear the same scratches and roars of deranged animals on the other side of this wall.
I mean, everything was so normal before Day One. I'm hardly even fifteen, and I doubt that these people here with me are hardly even in their twenties, and we're still fighting. We're fighting because these military people are needing more people, when we should still be in school and living normal, teenage and young adult lives.
I wouldn't call it hell, but I still remember Day One, when I was in Texas, my real home, just swimming in the Gulf of Mexico.
Day One: That was when shores were filled with dead animals.
And those animals that did survive only became more aggressive. They think those animals are monsters now, but truthfully, we all are. We all are for not trying to save everyone on the outside.
Whatever they think I did is nothing compared to what I've actually done. I had to do it, and I guess the reason doesn't make me a monster.
But it still doesn't change the fact that what I did was monstrous. Those animals were once just animals, and now Humanity's back on the food chain, because of monsters. Monsters that include us.
