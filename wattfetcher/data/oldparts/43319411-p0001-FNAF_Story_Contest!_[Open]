Here's the thing I'm also making FNAF fan game! It's called Five Nights With JonVon you can view the update book on my profile and I told people that they can have their OC'S in the game!
The problem is that there are too many! So this contest will determine who's characters get to be in the game.
The contest is based off what happened to Dominic and his friends at the end of my RE book.
