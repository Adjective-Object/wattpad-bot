I don't know how it happened,and I'm not quite sure why it happened.But it did.He came into my life expecting to look like the knight in the shiny armour.But infact he looked like a intoxicated fool.Who was he?I never knew.He never opened up to me.And till this day,I fucking wonder,why I even let him in?
