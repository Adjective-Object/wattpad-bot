Cold.Warm.Blue.Purple.Black...His eyes... I remember it as if it were dream, foggy but clear. I remember him... Eyes would chill the soul. But I feel warm... I would never forget his look, his touch, and his smile. He helped me. I forgot. Who is he?I feel warmth on my hand. My eyes open. Slightly. I see a shadow, a figure, him. My eyes feel heavy. "Hgh. Mmmh. Ngh." I feel a light kiss on my forehead. "Stop teasing me, imagination!", I think " ... I can't... not now ... no...". I close my eyes.
I wake up in the forest. "How?" Not remembering. "Why?" Someone's there. "Who?" I REMEMBER!!!!!!!When I gain consciousness, I see a man in front of me. Back to me... Sitting patiently, legs folded. I remember him from the war. He saved my life. But why? He turns his head. Looking at me... "Oh! Your awake!" That's him! "Trust me. From now on, depend on me. Only me... Please... Please..."A whisper escaped his mouth. His word wrapped me in warmth. He looks cold but he has a warm touch. He put one arm on my cheek and one on my rib... Observed me, then embraced me close. Shuffling sounds came from off-trail, towards us. In his embrace, I was able to not be seen be the enemy forces. "Thank you√¢~" I get cut off with a kiss. Not a rough, passionate or small peck, but it was soft, warm and full of love... "Why?" I managed to get the worst word - ever to say - to someone in this situation, out. "I'm... An... Idiot!!!"But why kiss the enemy?Why? Why? Why???? Puzzled!Love...? Nonsense. Maybe..."Sorry..." He whispered, cheeks - a little flushed, eyes - embarrassed and depressed. "So cute!" I thought but I wouldn't dare say that out loud. But again all I got out was the worst thing to say - to someone - in this situation "Why?" "..." He didn't speak. But he looked confused. But then he burst out laughing. "Why?" I say again. I really am an idiot, huh? "Speechless?" He asked me. I nod and tried to hold back the word I hate most. "Why?" "Oops, I almost said it again!"I thought. My head won't stop nodding! I lost control! His warm hands rubbed my cheeks and everything was quiet. My head stopped nodding. He leaned in close and... "STOP!!!" I jumped up. "What are you doing! We just met!" I shouted "..." He looked surprised. "Oh my god! What did I just do!" "Did I hurt him?" I was instantly pulled out of the way, at the sound of shuffling. Another soldier!Soldier 1: " This way!"Soldier 2: " Are you sure you heard someone here, in the middle of the forest?"Soldier 1: " Shut up and keep looking!"Soldier 2: " I give up! Look all you want but you won't find find anything! It's just a dumb animal!"Soldier 1: " Fine! We'll go but you'll regret this!"They leave. "Safe!" I sigh. Wait I just realized what position we're in. I was sitting on his lap...face-to-face...our lips inches from each other...him holding me tight. I look in his eyes...he looks in mine. I see myself blushing... "I'm going to kiss you." He whispered while leaning close. I couldn't move, I felt comfortable and safe in his arms. I didn't resist. "Why?" Aargh! I said it again. I blushed. HARD!!! I'm burning up. I felt faint. A whisper leaves my lips " Help." Our lips touch my, eyes close but don't open.Everything goes black...I feel warm...I feel safe...I feel a hand on mine... "Warm." I whisper unconsciously.A kiss on my forehead?!...Tears run down my cheeks...Are they mine?No...Who's are they?Don't know.
