"Wooaaah. I can't believe I'M BACK IN KOREA NOW!!" I said to myself while walking out of the airport.
I'm so happy now. Studying wasn't easy you know, but now I finally finished university in the U.S. studying Master of Arts in International Media and Entertainment Management.
Oh, and before telling my story I will introduce myself. My name is Park Kira Young but the fewest know my full name because I don't want to, they all know me just as Kira. Nevermind.
I had a really hard time in the U.S. because I was on my own back then and I really missed my brother and that's why I'm a bit cold to people I meet, not trying to trust them too fast.
I already experienced it that people you trust are ditching you when they don't need you anymore, just betraying you to reach better places or broadcast lies about you smiling in your face.
So now I have this arrogant image to save me from somebody hurting me. And life is easier doing this.
But now I'm back in Korea!!! My gooosh I'm sooo happy.
A vibration in my hand took me out of my thoughts. Omo! My brother is calling! I answered it directly. "Oppaaa, annyeong!" I greeted him excitedly. "Kiraa, I'm sooo sorry, the meeting took me a bit longer than I thought. Is it okay for you, if you take a taxi to go home?" he said. "woaaah oppaa, seriously?" I was kidding him. "hahah, it's alright, hmm.. than I will visit you after going home, okay? I really missed you."
"youu kid, don't dare kidding with me or I will have a bad conscience. I missed you too little sis. Okay than, come to the company after resting a bit. You're probably exhausted."
"yaaah, I told you not to call me sis or something like that, it will reveal our relationship. You know I don't want to be known as your sister in public. And it's okay I already slept while flying, so I'm not tired at all."
"Ok, I'll try my best. Than I will wait for you and there is also something important I have to tell you. Now I have to hang up. See you later than 'Miss Park' " and he hung up. He really pronounced Miss Park so ironically hahah.
I couldn't even ask what's it about. Damn I'm so curious. Ok, but now I have to find a taxi here. I looked around the area outside the airport and my eyes stopped searching when I saw one. I rushed with my luggage in the direction of the taxi and got inside quickly.
I barely wanted to tell the taxi driver where to go but suddenly the car door on the other side opened and someone was in hurry to get in the car but I couldn't even see anything because of too much flashlights.
He said "let's go!" to the taxi driver and the taxi driver started driving. What the fish is going on? Did he just now got in the taxi? Woah jinjja, I can't believe ,what is he thinking, am I an invisible passenger or what?
Than the taxi driver asked "Where am I supposed to take you?" We both said "Gangnam" at the same time.
I turned to him giving him a confused look. He weared a cap and sunglasses. "Heeey, I got the taxi first. Go find yourself another one" I said annoyed.
Than he looked at me and I could see in his face, well actually the part which could be seen like his mouth that was wide opended and his eyebrows which went up, that he was really shocked seeing me.
"Kira?..."
