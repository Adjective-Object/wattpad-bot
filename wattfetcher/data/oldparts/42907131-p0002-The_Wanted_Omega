I smiled and we both started talking for a little while. What I learned from him was that he was only 17 years old and dropped out of school to learn magic and illusions. He said that he wanted to try to capture Omega and jail her in prison, a special prison.
He afterwards had to leave and visit his grandmother that was outside of town. We gave each other our cell numbers and he saluted to me and left. I also decided to head home so I closed my shop, and starting walking home. It was only about a 15 minute walk but I decided to take it easier. I walked silently as the gravel beneath my feet shifted and making noises.
It started raining so I decided to run home since I didn't bring my umbrella along with me. I arrived and quickly opened the door and sprang inside. My clothes were super soaked as it dripped on the floor. I rushed upstairs and walked into my room. I grabbed a new pair of clothes and went into the washroom to change. As I finished,  I walked out and gasped of what I saw.
Someone had taken my mattress and replaced it with crumpled little note and I also lost my notebook that I bought to use it for a list of 'Things To Buy And Sell It At My Shop'. I slowly walked towards the crumpled note and held it in my hands. I saw that ink was smudged all over the paper and got onto my hands. I opened the note and read it over and over again:
Sorry, I'm just borrowing it,No one will actually catch me bc they ain't fit,I know I am small but I' pretty tough,Why does everyone gotta' be so rough?
Esther HenwicksVersusOmega Hemphrey Let's see who wins.
I sat down on the nearest chair and took a deep breath.
Why do I always get bad luck?
