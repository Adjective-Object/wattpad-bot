With a devastating car crash, he appeared.
A dark mop of unruly curls, the ends tinted with ruby red, framing a slender, pale face, flushed with the slightest bit of pink, eyes blazing against his ivory-pink skin. He was slender but tall, a scrawny, towering giant. He seemed so real, so genuine, so human. He even behaved normally. I didn't suspect a thing. He was just a dream, after all.
But I was wrong.
He was much, much more than just a dream.
