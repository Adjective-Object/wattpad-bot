Ring, Ring, Ring, Ring.I wake up from my dream. I slam my alarm clock. It keeps ringing. "Oh shut up!" I yell as I pull the covers over my head. The vibration from the ringing causes the alarm clock to fall to the floor. It stops ringing. "Oh god!" I say under my breath. I rush out of bed and get ready, hating my life. I brush my teeth and take a shower. I go through my closet and pick out a pair of fresh clothes. A white tank top, burgundy jeans, and brown combat boots. I dry and brush my blonde curly hair. I run downstairs. "Hey Buddy!" I say as I pat my dog's caramel colour coat. His big brown eyes stare up at me as he wages his tail and sticks out his tongue. I put some food and water into his dog bowls. I start to pack my homework into my backpack. I release the table is empty. I look at Biscuit. As I walk over to him, he realizes I am angry and moves away. I see my homework where he was was laying. The paper is crumbled up and bitten up. My teacher will never believe the classic excuse 'my dog ate my homework'. "Biscuit!" I groan. I decide to leave home and walk today instead of getting my dad to drop me. I don't want to have to explain why my homework is not done. "Dad! I'm walking!" I yell. There is no response. I go upstairs and knock on the door that leads to his bedroom. There is no response. I figure he went to work early today. He did talk about how much work he has left yesterday. On my way to school, it started to rain, causing my white tank top to become see through. I pulled a sweater out of my backpack, put it on and ran home to change. I put on a black shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and high top sneakers. I put the wet tank top into the washing machine. I stuff some food into my mouth. "Dad! Can you drive me to school!" I yell hoping he is home. There is no response. I feel silly for asking because I remember thinking he went to work early. I notice a yellow sticky note on the fridge. It reads "Emma, I am at work and I will probably not be home for three days. My boss, Mr. Evens, is asking me to go to Chicago for some work. Call me if you need anything! And remember No party's -dad". I want to scream. I grab my raincoat and run to school. It takes 15 minutes, even though I ran. I enter the big brown school doors. I walk to my locker. I put in my combination. 12-45-23. I open my locker. Water pours out and wets the bottom of my pants and soaks my shoes. A picture falls out with the water. I pick it up. It is wet. I flip it over. It is a picture of me and my mom. Tears build in my eyes as I see her face. She has blonde curly hair, just like me. She also has blue eyes, and a big smile. I remember how my mom died. We were on a cruise. I fell over and she thought I was drowning. By the time someone noticed, I was the only one they could save. My mother never let them save her. She wanted me to get back first but they couldn't save her. Her body was never found. My father refuses to think she is dead. He always says 'she's still alive and waiting for us to find her' The school bell intrudes my thoughts. I turn around. I see Mr. Cuto looking at me in angrily. His white hair is short. His brown eyes stare firmly at me. His wrinkly face manages to look stern. He leads me to the office. "Come in." Mr.Smith, our principal says. Mr. Cuto escorts me into the office. "What is the problem?" Mr. Smith asks without looking at us. "She wet the whole hallway!" Mr. Cuto says harshly. "Miss Stone, do you have anything to say for yourself?" Mr. Smith asks me. "It wasn't me! It was a prank!" I argue. "She's lying!" Mr. Cuto says desperately. I think he doesn't want to clean up the mess. "Thank you Mr. Cuto. I will take care of Miss. Stone. Could you be find enough to clean the water?" Mr. Smith asks. He stares at me. Mr. Cuto nods and exits the office. After Mr. Smith and I have sorted everything out, I walk towards the cafeteria. As I walk by Mr. Cuto, he grins at me and says "Next time, you will be the one cleaning this up!" I decide to ignore him. I reach the cafeteria, grab my food and sit alone. To my surprise, I see a girl walk towards me. She has long brown hair and blue eyes. She sits at my table. "Hey Liz." I say angrily. Liz is one of the most popular girls in school. She nods "Emma." Two other girls walk towards us. One has Ariel red hair and the other had sea blue hair. They both have hazel eyes. "Ariel. Jenna." I say. "How did you like that early shower?" Jenna says. "It was you guys?" I question shocked. While Jenna nods probably, Ariel and Liz nod sadly. Arieland Liz look as if they are ashamed for what they did. "What do you guys want?!" I ask. "Liz wants to throw a party!" Says Ariel. "And I can't throw it at my house because my parents are at home." Liz continues. "So why do you need me?" I ask. "We heard your dad isn't home." Jenna says with a grin. "What do I get out of it?" I ask. They look at each other. "You can be our friend." Ariel offers. I remember all the countless days that I have sat alone at lunch because nobody wanted to sit with me. I nod. I grab my bag, pick up my tray, and put it on top of the trash can and walk out of the cafeteria. I walk into the girls bathroom, sit down and start to cry. I miss my mom. I miss her a lot.
