Hey everyone! This is going to be my first story so it might suck at first until I edit it all.. Its going to take my a few days to upload the first few chapters because I'm in the process of moving and I also have summer school. :( But I'm excited to write the story and see what you all think, also please try not to put hate comments I read some of the thinks other people say and they were kinda rude. :/ Now I haven't decide what specific days, I was thinking Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes on the weekend. I might throw in some surprise chapters too depending on my schedule. I actually think I'll do the first four or five chapter by next week but it might change. Well I I hope you all give this story a chance and I really hope you can wait patiently so adios.
Oooh and also I promise you the chapters won't be short, I'm good with that lol but I'm seriously going to try to make them longer. Okay bye now :D
