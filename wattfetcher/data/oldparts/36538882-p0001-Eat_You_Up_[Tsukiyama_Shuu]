The purple haired man was looking at you as if he wanted to devour you whole. The pleasant smile on his face seemed real but with an underlying note of danger. You were talking with him, trying to hide how uncomfortable he was making you, babbling about various books and answering his questions whenever he asked them. Your heart jumped when he placed his hand on top of yours and you gave him a slight smile. His thumb moved on top of your hand, calming you down a bit.
"Tsukiyama-san," you spoke, glancing away from his eyes and looking out through the window, watching people pass by. "Why are you staring at me like that?"
"My beauty," Tsukiyama said, making your heart tremble and cheeks flush with color, picking up your hand and pressing a feather-light kiss to your knuckles. "You are like no other."
Tsukiyama turned your hand, cupping the back of it with his as the fingers of his other hand traced the veins on your wrist. His gaze was dark, seductive, as he smiled at you.
"Your heart, it is racing." He mumbled, staring in your eyes before his fluttered closed and his nose touched your wrist as he breathed your essence deeply. Your lips parted and you breathed out slowly, the air shuddering out of your chest. "Mmm, so appetizing."
His words sent a shudder right to your belly, his voice caressing the syllables. Your body kept telling you that Tsukiyama is dangerous, a devil in disguise, ready to jump out at any opportune moment and eat you up- like a wolf did grandma and Little Red Riding Hood. Except, you didn't really want a hunter to save you, you wanted to be eaten by this dashing, eccentric, persona.
Tsukiyama's fingers tip-toed up your arm to your face, second and third finger curling around a lock of your hair.
