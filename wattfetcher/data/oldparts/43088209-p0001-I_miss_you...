The book will not be updated as often as the other books I have written earlier, since I also work on another project.I hope you will enjoy 'I miss you' ...

SMS message - 10:45 Sunday morning

Hi Angie

I'm writing just to tell you that we landed in Qatar, the flight was fine and I feel good. Miss you and love you!

Hug from your beloved niece...

The message from Violetta goes straight into the heart. She has just landed after a 17-hour flight and are probably tired, but she has not forgotten me. The message is both sad and soothing. It is sad because it reminds me that my niece is hundreds of kilometers away. But at the same time soothes me, because I know that she has landed safely.

But no matter how nice it is to know that she is no longer sitting in a plane high above the earth's surface, she is still too far away to that I would be able help her with her problems and that I would be able to talk properly with her. No matter how close a relationship we have, nothing we do to keep in touch, could replace the relationship we had before they left.

They... They traveled both. Violetta against her will and German? German traveled because...

I can not collect my thoughts! Or do I just do not know why he left? I can not see any logical reason for that he found it necessary to leave everything. I know that I have not told the truth about everything, but he did nor... For that matter told Violetta nor the truth... and Olga, Ramallo, Jade, Mathias. No one told the truth.

Maybe this was why? He said he wanted to get away from all the lies, it makes sense. But why in this way?

Too many questions and far too few answers!

I take a deep breath. Breathe. Relax. You have to concentrate, Pablo expect that you are at The studio in half an hour. My inner voice instructs me carefully in how I should deal with my current situation.

The end of the year show was a great success and Pablo would like to see all students and teacher at the studio to thank them for the hard work and wish them a good summer holiday.

Summer holidays... It's just what I need, I will visit Violetta! In the worst case I am going to stay in Qatar after the summer is over, but nothing is certain yet. I do not even know when I leave Buenos Aires. All these formalities will I take care of later.

My eyes fall back on the phone, which is now black, to save power. I press the code again and Violetta's message is again visible ... 'I feel good '
