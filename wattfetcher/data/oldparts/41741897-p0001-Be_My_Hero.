Kirstie's POVMy body feels bruised and limp. My eyes red and swollen. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I exist. All I know is this isn't the end, this is the beginning. "Honey are you coming?" my mom yells interrupting my thoughts. "Yup" I yelled back. I sighed as I zipped up my suit case. As I walked out of my room I looked back at it as tears rolled down my cheek. I don't know why I'm leaving, I don't know why people think I'm messed up. But I do know that this is where the horror movie begins. And so far I don't like it one, bit.
Mitch's POVScreaming, that's all i ever hear. They're always screaming at me. I called them my demons. Otherwise known as the voices inside my head. No one except me knows what they say. But no one even cares about me. " MITCH ARE YOU THERE?" My roommate Scott says waving his hand in my face. "Yea I'm here, DUH!" I sassed making Scott laugh. Scott knows about the voices inside my head, but he doesn't understand them. Everyone I know in this place has gone through the same thing I have. But just because they've gone through the same thing, doesn't mean they understand me.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my first fan fiction so please don't judge.
