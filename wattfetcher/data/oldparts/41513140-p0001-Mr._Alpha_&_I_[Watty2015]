"This party is so wild," I screamed over the loud music. Today is my Seventeenth birthday. My brother decided we should celebrate by having a huge party. At first I thought that idea was insane. But look where we are now.
"Best party of the year!" Kat my best friend agreed. My name is Caroline Brooks. I'm one of the triplet including Jasper Brooks and Sofia Brooks. Today we celebrated being alive for another year. "I can't believe your mom let you guys have a party."
"Well Jasper is pretty convincing." I shrugged. Kat and I walked into the kitchen to grab a can of soda. No alcohol was involved, my mom would kill us.
All heads turned as bad Boy Isaac Stone walked into the kitchen with a blonde known as Stacie Hall. "No alcohol involved? what a party." Stacie said clearly not liking the idea of no alcohol.
"Then leave, because there isn't and wont be any." Kat snapped. She's always hated Stacie since an incident in Seventh grade. Back then they used to be best friends. It ended horrible. Stacie had spread rumors all over the school saying Kat lost her v-card to a twenty-year-old man.
"Whatever, lets leave Isaac, this so called party sucks!" she air quoted and pulled Isaac away. "I hate that bitch, can't see how Isaac puts up with that whore."
"You know he's only with her because she'll spread her dirty legs for him." I said. Isaac's the fuckboy of our school. "He's a slut she's a slut, a match made in heaven."
Kat laugh stopped and her face turned cherry red. The reason for that is Dylan Alex. She's had this huge crush on him since freshman year. "Hey Dylan." I said casually. Dylan and I are good friends, well actually he's friends with Jasper but still the same thing. He talks to me a lot so I consider him a friend.
"Hey Care-bear, have you seen Jasper?" He asked. Dylan is a good looking guy. He has light brown hair, and blue crystal eyes. "No, probably somewhere sucking Arden's face off, poor girl"
"H-hey Dylan," Kat stuttered. I smiled, she's never said a word to him until now. I've always told her to talk to him but she always chicken out. "Hey, Katherine right?"
"Its Kat, just call me Kat." I winked at her and left. I made my way to the dance floor and danced to the music. Tonight I had on a red strapless knee length dress with black flats, you'll never see me in heels. My long brunette hair was curled and I wore light makeup that brought out my Brown eyes.
I saw my sister and made my way over to her. Sofia and I are totally different. She's all girly I'm not, She's well known, I'm not she's liked by the guys and I'm not. Sofia has light brown hair and dark green eyes while I have brunette hair and brown plain brown eyes. "Hey Sofia."
"Care, oh my gosh you missed the most funniest thing, Luke just puked all over Jasper. It was so hilarious, you should've seen Jasper's face."
"So that's why he's MIA."
"Babe, wanna head to my place?" Levi asked Sofia. "Hm, sure. See Ya later Care."
"Bye, oh and if you do anything I would, use condoms!" she looked back and made a gag face. I chuckled and ran up the stairs to go make fun of Jasper.
