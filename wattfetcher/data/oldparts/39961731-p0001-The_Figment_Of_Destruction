"Charlie. Charlie. Charlie!" Someone screamed in my ear. I picked myself up and was sitting on my bed with my eyes wide open. I looked around my room and found my 12 year old brother, Logan staring at me. He was already dressed for school.
"Logan!" I screamed as I threw a pillow at his face. "What are you doing in my room?!"
"Mom told me to wake you up," He answered.
"Why?" I asked tiredly.
"Because it's 7:10. You need to get ready."
"Damn it! Why do I always do that?!" I asked myself as I jumped out of bed and quickly ran to my closet. I picked out my clothes and ran into the bathroom to take a quick shower.
Days like this were always complicated. I'm just a regular 16 year old high school girl. I have long blonde hair, ending at my waist, and light blue eyes. I also have a clear face with dimples. I have natural pink lips and a small nose.
I'm not like most girls, though. I don't care about shopping that much, how I look in clothes, or what people think of me. I'm more like a tomboy, but I have some girly ways.
After I got dressed, I ran down the stairs quickly to get some breakfast. I found my mom putting my breakfast on the counter, where we usually sit and eat at.
"Hey, Mom." I greeted.
"Hi, sweetie." She greeted back. "Eat quickly before you miss the bus."
"I will." I said as I sat down. Logan came down and sat on the high stool next to me. We both finished our breakfast at the same time.
"Wow, little bro. I didn't know you could finish breakfast that fast. I usually finish before you." I spoke.
"Dude. Things are happening at my school. I can't miss out." Logan replied.
"Like what?" I asked.
"We don't have time for this." Mom interrupted. "Logan, get in the car. I'll meet you there."
"Alright." Logan agreed. He dropped his dish in the sink, grabbed his backpack, and left the house.
"Okay. Charlotte. Why are you wearing that?" Mom asked.
"First of all, I prefer Charlie. Second of all, why are you all of a sudden worrying about the clothes I wear?" I was wearing a huge blue T-shirt with red plaid skinny jeans and blue-green Converse shoes.
"Because I don't like it. Do you really have to wear that?"
"Yes and don't forget the best part." I picked up the black hat with a diamond I brought downstairs. "The hat!"
"Charlotte, why do you have to be like this? Why can't you be the girl I've always wanted you to be?" Mom questioned. I heard the bus pull up at the curb.
"I am the girl you've always wanted me to be. I'm being myself, but no, you have to change me. Why can't you accept that?"
"Look, Charlotte. It's just..."
"It's just what, Mom? Look. I gotta go. The bus is waiting. Bye." I picked up my backpack and headed out of the door. I ran to the bus before the doors shut me out. I found an open seat by the window and watched Mom get in her car and drive Logan away. I will never understand the hazel eyed, brunette mother of mine.
