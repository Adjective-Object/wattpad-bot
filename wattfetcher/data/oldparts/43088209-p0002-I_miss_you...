She feel good, HA! Violetta plays strong, she will not worry me, but both she and I know that the fact that her father has moved her again, is the worst thing he ever could do to her.

And I'm back at German... Will he continue to haunt my thoughts?

'Miss you and love you'... If only I could hear her say it, if only I could hear her say that she misses me and love me, right now, I would be the happiest aunt in the world and I would tell her how much I miss her and how much I love her.

Words can not describe what I feel and have felt for the last 24 hours ... And me who thought that the last year was hard, HA ...

Less than 20 minutes I have to be at The studio.

Your beloved aunt, Angie!
