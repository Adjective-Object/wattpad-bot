I sighed and patted my clothes down then went to the bathroom. I washed my face and dried my nose. I had some emergency cover up make up I took from Mikasa just in case Jean would beat me up but I only use it to cover up bruses. I took it out and patted down my cheek with it covering up the spot of a bruse Jean left on me. I sighed once I finished and placed it back into my bag. I looked in the mirror and saw my reflection.
'A boy.........with no one who loves him and a family who ignores him.......a life with no one to help him.......to save him......to be his prince charming to his sleeping beauty.......that's who that boy was in the mirror........ Eren Jeager.....me.'
I walked out the bathroom and down the hall to my next class. On my way I was interrupted by Armin running towards me with his usual happy smile across his face. I smiled as he hugged me again.
"Armin we're in the halls people will talk"I said teasingly.
"I know, I know......its just I miss you a lot"he said and let go of me.
"Its fine........besides I missed you too"I said and smiled. He blushed which is always when someone says something about him.
I know it might seem strange with me and Armin but we're really just the greatest bestfriends to each other. He always makes me smile and..........that's why he's my guardian angel.
