"Lets go somewhere more private"
I didn't wait for an answer, I just grabbed her hand and guided her toward the exit. On the way home she couldn't keep her hands off me. When we got to my house I hooked my hands around the back of her thighs and lifted her up, placing myself in between her legs. I blindly opened the door without breaking our passionate kiss. I threw her on the couch being too impatient to go all the way to my room, and began undressing her.
Andy's POV
I heard the door open. It was probably Ashley, who had finally arrived from party, so I didn't pay much attention. Until I heard moaning coming from the living room. The curious side of me stood up from my warm, cozy bed and headed quietly downstairs. I wish I had stayed tucked in my bed. What I saw made me feel like if I had a hole in my chest. I gulped at the sight of Ash with a woman on the couch having sex. I quietly ran up the stairs and returned to the comfort of my bed wishing that this was a dream. I knew that Ash was a ladies man but I was not ready to see that, no matter how much I had prepared myself. I could still hear them, so I grabbed my earphones blasting music through them until I fell asleep with crow curled up at my feet.
