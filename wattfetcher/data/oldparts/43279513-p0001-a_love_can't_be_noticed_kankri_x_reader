so you are a new troll in a small town. it is your first day at your new school so you put on your (f/c) shoes, and your (f/c) shirt with black jeans. after you get dressed you put your (H/C) hair in a katniss everdeen like ponytail since she is your role model of all time. so you grabbed your (f/c) bookbag and head out the messy unpacked bedroom and close the door. you walked down the stairs and get (favorite cereal) out of the cabinet in the kitchen and your milk out of the fridge too. then you forgot your bowl so as soon you put down your cereal and milk you grabbed the bowl and spoon too. you made your breakfast and sat down and watch (favorite tv show) and then got up turning off your tv then putting your dish in the kitchen sink and head out the door, and locked the door after you got out putting it in your bookbag you start walking down the streets since the chool was a few blocks away, then you see a few trolls one wearing a black t-shirt with a red cancer sign with grey jeans and black shoes with a white underbottom of the shoe with messy hair, and small horns. then you see a spiky mopey haired troll with 1990s like 3D like color glasses with a green Gemini sign on a black t-shirt with grey jeans and black and white shoes, and had two spikey horns one smaller then the other on each side ,then you see a messy curly hair troll with a purple Capricorn sign on the same color shirt with grey polka dotted like saggy pants and purple shoes but his face looked weird maybe because of the makeup he has on he also had tall little outward tip horns. you have a ability to observe things very quickly and memorize things more quicker then a average troll and your aren't going to a regular school, but to highly private school. then you almost there to your school then you made it.

you soon enter a private school you are greeted to a office lady she was named Ms.piexes then you asked office manger for your schedule then she gives to you then you leave.  you read it first you have
*gym
*science
*ELA
* GUIDED STUDY
* Math
* Social studies
* (favorite school objective)
then you are busy reading the schedule you accidently bumped into a red sweater troll with the same horns  and hair as the zodiac cancer one you saw at the street with light grey pants and coffee like color shoes, "9h I am truly s9rry t9 trigger anything!?" he said  you answer in return  "why it is fine I hope I didn't trigger any bad memories either so I can related to anyway  mistakes."  you try to impress him by the way.  " y9u didn't at all I'm kankri vantas what is y9ours?" he asked  you answer back "I am (f/n) (l/n) and I like your name sound like a fancy clothing brand."  you soon forgot what you dropped in the first place and kankri looked at it and gave it to you, "why I kn9w where the classes are I will sh9w y9u.  kankri offered as he grabbed your hand and lead you to the classes or well giving you a tour, you blushed a little but not to much to show on your face.
you wanted to break the silence between you and kankri so you asked him a question a simple one "do you have any friends here?" he hid under his turtleneck sweater "n9." he answered muffled, you saw little candy red tears falling down from his eyes.  you felt kinda of guilty for asking it so both of you stopped kankri stood still and you hugged him from behind. " I will be friend." you whispered as you grabbed your  hand to wipe his tears, smiled a little and broke the hug. he said " why I f9rg9t I have all of these classes with y9u!" you and kankri went to gym first, you felt sort of shy in the locker room because the (boy/girl) had strangers in it and you were new so you went to the stalls to change instead and put your bag in the lockers and soon went with the girls. you soon chered up as you saw kankri there he did look cute in those gym clothes and he was looking at  your butt while you stretched with the girls since it was huge so were your boobs then it was freetime at gym. after the school day was done. you and kankri decided to go to walk together.
well I hoped you enjoyed this and it is gonna get a bit hot if you know what it means
