You started to walk away when he grabbed your hands and spun you around
Him:No it's not fine....there is obviously somthing wrong ,you can trust me even if you just met me .......oh and almost forgot my name is Austin....so you wanna tell me what's wrong???
You started to cry even harder.Austin hugged you
