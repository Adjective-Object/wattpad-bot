The cold breeze ran across my neck. Smell of fresh cut grass filled my nostrils. The slow rhythm in my ears playing the weeks stress away. I felt myself slowly rocking back and forth. The clouds painting a imaginary giraffe for me to picture.
"Honey, ready to come in? Dinners ready." I'm snapped out out of my luxury. I removed my earbuds and turned toward my husband.
I swung my legs over the outdoors chair. I slipped my toes into my sandals following after my husband. I shut the glass door behind me after stepping into the warm kitchen.
"What did you prepare?" I asked. "Roast lamb with balsamic reduction. I know you'll love this Eden. " His voice was fixed. Almost like he'd planned the meal and conversation.
The aroma of the food traveled down to my stomach and decided it was time to eat. I sat myself down across the dark long wooden table. Zachary was fixing my plate at the island near the stove.
Soon after he was done, he came to the table with a bottle of white wine, and my plate. The eating utensils and glasses already on the table.	 He placed the plate in front of me, and kissed me on the forehead. His action made me wince a little.
He walked over to the other side of the table and sat down. "Eden. What is wrong? I've prepared you dinner. Did I do something to displease you?" The annoyance was clear in his voice. But I didn't care. I lifted my head up from the fine china sitting in front of me, losing my appetite. "I appreciate you making dinner this evening Zachary. You haven't done anything. I'm just a little bit stressed." I lied. I lied for what seemed like the 1000th time this week. He put his fork down and scoffed at my response to his questions.
"Stressed? Over what?" I suddenly found myself pouring wine to the rim of my glass.
I tried to think of things that are happening in the family. "I'm concerned about my fathers condition. My mother is getting old enough to the point where she isn't going to be able to work anymore, that means i'm going to have to put her in a home. My little brother is running out of money to pay for his last two years of college. My family is going through a lot and I am not there with them." I tried to sound convincing as possible. Before he continued on I took a big sip of wine.
"This is what has been bothering you? You are ridiculous. I give you everything I have. But yet it still feels like you are asking more from me. Give me an estimate on how much your family will need and I will see what I can do.." He was angry and I was confused.
"I did not ask you for anything. You simply asked a question and I answered." I said plainly. He stared at me, with fire in his eyes. He couldn't have been drunk his words weren't slurred, he was able to move just fine. Why was he getting so mad over nothing?
Zachary stood from the table dropping his fork on his plate. He gave me one last glare and left to the garage. I didn't bother to chase after him. I finished my glass of wine and excused myself from the table too.

Mid-way through my reality TV show, my phone rings. I reach into my back pocket, the caller ID reads, "Mother".. I hit the ignore button, too stressed out from earlier events to even bother.
I heard the garage open and the car back in. My heart starting beating a little faster. "You stupid bitch! Just wait until I see you.." I could smell his intoxication from the living room.
I arose from my sitting position and stood from the white recliner, waiting for him to do whatever. His work boots were pounding against the wooden floor paneling.
