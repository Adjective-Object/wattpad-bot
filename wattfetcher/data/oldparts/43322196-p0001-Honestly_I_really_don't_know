Dear whoever you are,Hi I'm Parker...I guess I'm average,Eh...Not really. People always tell me I'm not normal...Because of my bright red hair or because I obsess over bands. Well screw them. I like me (I think) anyway I have some things I want to clear before I go any further 1. I am not a boy just because my name is Parker 2.This isn't a diary I'm just documenting my life 3.My life isnt that interesting. Alright lets go.
