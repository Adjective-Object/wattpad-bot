[Verse 1:]What would I do without your smart mouth?Drawing me in, and you kicking me outYou've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you downWhat's going on in that beautiful mindI'm on your magical mystery rideAnd I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
[Pre-Chorus:]My head's under waterBut I'm breathing fineYou're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus:]'Cause all of meLoves all of youLove your curves and all your edgesAll your perfect imperfectionsGive your all to meI'll give my all to youYou're my end and my beginningEven when I lose I'm winning'Cause I give you all of meAnd you give me all of you, oh oh
[Verse 2:]How many times do I have to tell youEven when you're crying you're beautiful tooThe world is beating you down, I'm around through every moodYou're my downfall, you're my museMy worst distraction, my rhythm and bluesI can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
[Pre-Chorus:]My head's under waterBut I'm breathing fineYou're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus:]'Cause all of meLoves all of youLove your curves and all your edgesAll your perfect imperfectionsGive your all to meI'll give my all to youYou're my end and my beginningEven when I lose I'm winning'Cause I give you all of meAnd you give me all of you, oh oh
[Bridge:]Give me all of youCards on the table, we're both showing heartsRisking it all, though it's hard
[Chorus:]'Cause all of meLoves all of youLove your curves and all your edgesAll your perfect imperfectionsGive your all to meI'll give my all to youYou're my end and my beginningEven when I lose I'm winning'Cause I give you all of meAnd you give me all of you
I give you all of meAnd you give me all of you, oh oh
