Vanessa
I was wondering around the forest when I heard howls , I followed them which lead me to Wolves who were running 'how is this possible?' 'Because it is' 'W-who are you?' 'I'm Lana your Wolf' 'I'm a werewolf?!' 'Yes now let's shift' 'ok' then pain hits my body as I start to shift , My bones start to reassemble into a wolf body. After I'm done shifting , I run along side the pack until they stop and look at me , I hide behind a rock and shift back into my human body 'Lana what should I do?' 'Join their pack and train' 'ok if that's what's best' I come from behind the rock and face them "Hello I'm Vanessa , can I join your pack?" "Yes you may let's go back to pack grounds" a boy says "ok but can we have a run first?" "Ok everyone shift" the boys says , everyone shifts and I shift as well. I look in reflection and I see me as an all white wolf , then everyone starts running and I follow them , I notice I'm faster then them and we reach Pack Grounds.
I meet the Alpha of the pack and I meet his son who will be the alpha soon "You must get rest its Nighttime" Alpha Matthew said "ok Alpha Matthew and Goodnight" I say and go into my new room which I decorated , It has a white bed with a bookshelf and I had lanterns hanging from the ceiling.
I layer down on my bed and turned off my lamp and drifted off to sleep
This Is How My Story Began.......
