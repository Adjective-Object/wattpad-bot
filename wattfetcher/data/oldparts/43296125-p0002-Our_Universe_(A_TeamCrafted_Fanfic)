I'm right here, when you gonna realise,
That I'm your cure,
Heartbreak Girl,
I bite my tongue,
But I wanna scream out,
You could be with me now,
But I end telling you what you wanna hear,
But you're not ready,
And it's so frustrating,
He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, it's not fair,
And when the phone call finally ends,
You say, "I'll call you tomorrow at ten.",
And I'm stuck in the friend zone again and again,
I dedicate this sing to you,
The one who never sees the truth,
That I can take away your hurt,
Heartbreak Girl,
Hold you tight straight through the daylight,
I'm right here, when you gonna realise,
That I'm your cure,
Heartbreak Girl,
I know someday it's gonna happen,
And you'll finally forget the day you met him,
Sometimes you're so close to your confession,
I've gotta get it through your head,
That you belong with me instead,
I dedicate this sing to you,
The one who never sees the truth,
