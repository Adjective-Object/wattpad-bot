My name is Avalina, I am 12 year old girl. My mommy is an Fox angel, well a shadow Fox Angel, and my father is the wonderful slenderman. I live with my mommy and get bullied at school. My hair is jet black and my eyes are purple. I'm not one who really does much. I draw, read, play video games, chores. I have no friends besides my mommy and father. I'm a daddy's girl. I also have certain powers, I can sense about anything within a mile from me. The others my mom gave me was flying, sensing, agility, I'm immune to sickness, and my eyes can change color, I can also shift into animals. The abilities my dad gave me were, telepathy, telekinesis, I have tentacles, and teleportation. My birthday is on Halloween. I love scary things and I love spicy foods. Adore them. I also have a younger sister names Angela. We are not the vest of friends of sisters. We fight a lot and sometimes we try to kill each other. Angela is 8 and her birthdays on new years eve. She has all the same abilities and she had white hair and pink eyes. She hates everything I love. Well, almost anything. :)
