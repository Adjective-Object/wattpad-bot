(Dans POV)I have been having strange dreams since about a year ago. I have been having them ever since I played with the Sprit Board.
MEMORY
"I'm bored" PJ said "Well children, we are out in the wilderness for a class trip there are PLENTY of things for you to do" My boring grade 10 teacher had said as she left the boys cabin"Ok why don't we go in the forest?" Chris had said with a lot of excitement "Sounds good" Said Phil my best friend They started walking in the forest and then Chris ran up ahead so all of us followed after."Oi lads I found a Sprit Board!" Chris called back to us"Cool" I had said sarcastically"Should we try it?" PJ questioned"I don't know maybe it's dangerous" Phil said "C'mon lets do it!" Chris said enthusiastically "Fine" Phil said sounding a bit frightened"Ok why not?" I said PRESENT DAYMan, was Phil right if it wasn't for that Sprit Board he wouldn't have died 2 weeks later. The doctors said he committed suicide but I don't believe that bullshit. He always told me if something was going on, and lately my dreams would have been something I would have told him... Because they were about him... They were about they Cutest 16 year old boy I have ever laid my eyes on. What pulled me out of these thoughts was my mom softly entering my room"Dinners ready love" my mom said quietly she was always had the softest voice and I loved it. She had only raised it when I told her I was gay she was so happy that I was honest and open with her she raised her voice. "Alright" I said as I followed her out of my room and closed the door softly.
