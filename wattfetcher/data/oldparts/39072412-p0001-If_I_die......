"Hey can you take down the trash? " Dad asked me as he finished stuffing the last of the trash into a garbage bag."I can't reach it. " I said reaching for the garbage bag, from my comfy position on the couch watching "Gravity Falls". "Oh lookie!  Is this a 20$ bill?" Dad said waving a 20 dollar bill. "WHAT IS MY MISSON? " I imediately jumped off of the couch, but then quickly turned around and paused the show. I walked up to where dad stood holding the garbage. I slipped into a pair of random sneakers and grabbed the bag, and 20 dollars,  and began dragging the bag to the metalic trashcan.I pulled up the cover and threw the trash in.
But just as I began walking back, I saw a creature, it was inhuman, bloodied body, tatered, ripped, blood soaked clothing. His hair was mainly ripped off and chunks of his skin were missing, causing bones to stick out in weird angles. It looked around ignoring me but still walking towards my house.
Luckily before he limped to the door, and broke it or my dad opened it thinking it was me. A gun shot was heard and the body fell. I gulped and started crying in fear, as the Soilders picked up the corpse, my family piled out and mom hugged me tightly as the guards spoke to my dad.
~~~~~TIME SKIP CAUSE I CAN~~~â€¢~~
The next day, they told us we were moving to somewhere called CDC. We wwould get rooms that we would have to share. Obviously it was, mom & dad and me & my sister, Maebelle.
I held her fragile,  little hand as we walked to a car, while a truck, filled with our stuff (except furniture and stuff like that) followed closely behind us.
We were driving through a small Georgian town as we stooped to get gas. Me and my sister sat outside on a bench as a little boy a little older than me, came up to us.
"Hi I'm Carl." He said with a smile. "I'm Lyric that's my little sister Maebelle. " I pointed to myself then my sister. " I like your name, do you llike music? " I nodded my head and giggled." Where are you going? " Carl aasked obvious if the truck and police men.So I explained the (long) story to him."Carl! There you are!" A woman yelled."Oh sorry. Is he your son?" My mom asked, while I didn't even now she came back."Sorry was he bothering you? " The woman asked."No. We become friends. " I answered for mom."Oh how about we exchange numbers, so you guys could see eachother again." Said the woman."OK sure. I'm Serena." Mom introduced herself. "I'm Lori. " The woman, Lori said.They exchanged numbers and just as I was about to get into the car, Carl ran up to me."Just in case we don't meet again. " He planted a soft small kiss on my cheek and ran away, waving.I waved back with one hand on my cheek.
My mom giggled and told me to go inside, while still laughing.
Well these two days were weird.
