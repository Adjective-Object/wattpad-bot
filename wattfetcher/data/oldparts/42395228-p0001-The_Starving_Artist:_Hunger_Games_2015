If you are reading this I am assuming that you are interested in entering the first edition of the Starving Artist Games (S.A. Games for short:)). I am also assuming that you want to know more about this, which is very important and will come through the following chapters. For now, just know that the S.A. Games is a large Hunger Games writing contest where 24 of you will write, kill, and maim for victory! Also, please spread the word :)
But before we get to all that, let's meet a few of our Gamemakers of WattPanem, shall we?
