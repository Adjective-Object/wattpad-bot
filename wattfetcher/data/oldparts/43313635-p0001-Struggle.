Maegan POV
When I was five, I wish for happiness.
I know, such a big word for a five years old kid. But back then, things were bad. Actually, it was far from bad. It was terrible. My brother, Austin or as I like to call him Rex and I lived with our mom because our parents got a divorce when I was still four and Rex was twelve.
Mom never wants a divorce since Rex and I were still so young, but when she caught dad cheating on her for the fourth time, she lost it. I mean, who wouldn't? If I were her, I would lost it the first time I found out my husband cheating on me. She's such a strong woman.
I didn't really understand what a divorce is back then. But I know it's not good. Because every night, my mom would cried. I know because I used to sleep in her room due to my nightmares. When she thought I was sleeping, she would tell me how much she loves Rex and I and how sorry she was about the divorce thing.
It was heart-breaking, hearing the woman who gave birth to you, the one who raised you, the one who would whisper sweet things to you to make you feel better, the one who promised will scare those monsters from your dreams away from you, the one that has been so damn strong finally breakdown and crying.
I didn't blame her for divorcing my dad. He was a terrible dad. Every weekends he would come home drunk around midnight. He always woke me up from how loud he's being when he went up to his room.
He never kiss me goodnight. He never hold my hand when we're out. He never bought me ice cream or lolly. He was never there. Not for my birthdays, not for my first day at kindergarten, never. It's like he forgot that he's a father. I always get jealous whenever I see my friends with their dad. Why can't I have a dad like that too?
So, on my fifth birthday, I wish for happiness. For me, for my mom and for Rex. For the three of us, to have a new beginning and make new memories.
To just start fresh and be happy.

Hi! So tell me what you guys think about this story. Should I go for it or just leave it?
This chapter is kind of like a prologue and I know this is super short but prologues aren't meant to be long ay? haha. And in the next chapters Maegan and Austin will be a few years older.
Your comments will means a lot for me.
Thank you, peace out! xx
