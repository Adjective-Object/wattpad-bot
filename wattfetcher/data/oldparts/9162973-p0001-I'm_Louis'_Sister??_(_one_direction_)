Elissa's POV:BEEP BEEP BEEP.Ugh. I really don't want to get up today.. I slowly drag myself out of bed and take a quick shower. After that, I dry my hair and curl it, and then get dressed. It's the middle of December and I live in London. It's FREEZING, so I'm wearing a knit-style sweater that says meow, with skinny jeans and my UGGs. Ahh. Perfect."ELISSA! TIME TO LEAVE!" my foster mom shouts. My goal for this winter break is to find my real parents. I wonder why they got rid of me. I don't care if they don't want me back, but I would like to know why they didn't want me. Why wasn't I good enough for them? What did I do wrong? I've been in foster care as long as I remember....."Elissa, honey, we're here! Have a great day and don't forget that you are going to Kennedy's after school." Penny, my foster mom, says. Wow... I started daydreaming.Here we go... only 6 hours left of this thing they call school this semester......---------------------------------AUTHORS NOTE:hi(: I'm new to writing.. I hope you like it.
