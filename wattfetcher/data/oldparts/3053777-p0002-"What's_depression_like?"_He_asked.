It makes me someone I don’t wanna be.



I was born on the August 2th 1995. That makes me seventeen. My name is Kyran, my friends like to call me Rain.

I’ve been called many things, many names. People left me, people hurt me, people made me cry and then laughed because that was exactly what they wanted me to do.

If I would tell people my story, they would call me an attention seeker. Maybe I am an attention seeker. Maybe attention is exactly what I want.

Because somewhere people like me don’t really want to die. We want to be saved.

I know what it’s like to want to die. How it hurts to smile. How you try to fit in but you can’t. How you hurt yourself on the outside to try to kill the thing on the inside.

I know exactly what it’s like.

I know how some of you struggle to get up every day, disappointed because you woke up again.

I know how you want to ask for help, but every time you get the chance to, you don’t.

“You fake a smile, lie and say that, you’re better now than ever and you’re life’s okay.”

But it’s not.



I have friends. They know how I feel. They know my story, they know my past, they know who I am. They know every part of me, even the dark ones. They know my wishes, what I want the most, the things I do.

They try to help me. They try to help me through. They will always be there when I cry. They will always hold me when I ask for it.

But I can’t ask for it. I can never ask for things like that. I can never ask for someone to help me or hold me. I’m scared to be hugged. I’m scared for someone to hold my hand.

Why?

Because of my parents.

Because of the two people that are supposed to hold me and hug me when I ask for it.

They never did.

They never do.

They punish me for being born. They abuse me because I breathe something I shouldn’t be doing in their eyes.

Yes, I’m still alive because of my friends. But not only because of my friends. Because I know dying is exactly what my parents want me to do.
