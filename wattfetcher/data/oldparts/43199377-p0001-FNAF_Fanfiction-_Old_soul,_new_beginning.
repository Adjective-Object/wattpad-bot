-Wolf's POV-W.... Where am I...? How did I get here? ...I feel kind of strange... and sick....... My vision slowly focuses. I blink a couple of times, slight pain in some of my limbs. The smell of dust and bleach is strong, but the silence is far more consuming. I close my eyes and try remember where I am and why I am here, but my memory is a black blur. I remember darkness and pain. I think back to when I was last active. I remember a man, but not much about him. The more I try to remember his features, the more they slip.  A tear rolls down my cheek as a dark memory consumes me, taking a tight hold of my vision and forcing it into past memories.///Flashback beginsI feel the coolness envelope my small body. Without opening my eyes, I know that I am in water. The feeling is unpleasant, even with the vagueness of the fading worries. I feel my pain begin to fade. I smile, but as I take a breath, water begins to attack my circuits and cause great pain. Choking, I begin to realize that I am drowning. My eyes flicker open, the water stinging my eyes as I stare downwards into the dark murkiness.The water bubbles, the air escaping from under my suit and rising to the surface of the sink water. Spoons and other cutlery litter the bottom, covered in grime and food stains. My hands continue to flail upwards, but I refuse to put them into the water to fry.I try to get up out of the water, but his hands hold me down. I try to scratch at the hands holding me under, to kick at the figure pushing me under from behind, but there is no success. I don't even think I hit him, nor do I think really bother him. Both of his hands push harder, and my face meets the bottom of the giant sink. Forks and knives dig through to my endoskeleton, letting in the water and causing great pain.The water gets into my circuits, and I begin to spasm uncontrollably. A loud scream is muffled under the water. My programming tells me 'Something is incredibly wrong' as my drives malfunction, all of my body conducting electricity through the water. And then, my body stops. He holds me under a minute longer, to make sure I am dead. He lifts me out, my body completely limp, and drops me to the ground. My body, slack and weak, falls into a heap of metal on the floor. Water pools around me, oil from my systems staining it a crimson-grey. The liquid drips from my mouth, which is still full with the liquid. My vision begins to blur, but no matter how hard I try,  I cannot close my eyes.The man looks down at me with a look of both annoyance and concentration, as if he doesn't know what to do next. With a sigh, he tightly grabs me arms and begins to drag me away. I want to close my eyes so badly, but I can't move myself in any way. I cannot speak. Left on my back, man hovers over me, smiling. With all of the errors I have, he actually looks purple. He drags me away, a large water streak is the only evidence of anything happening. The darkness closes in on me, a predator attacking its prey. And my life isn't the only thing it takes. My happiness, too.Flashback ends///
