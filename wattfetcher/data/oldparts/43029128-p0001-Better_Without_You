Prologue:
My name is Abri. I am about 5'2", really thin, have long raven black hair that reaches about midback and light chocolate brown eyes, just like my brothers, Daniel.
He is one year older than me, making him 19 and me just about to turn 18 in about a day actually. Daniel is well liked while I on the other hand....not so much, considering I have no friends whatsoever. Daniel is about to become the next beta of our pack, the Blood Moon pack, the largest, stongest pack in all of America.
You would think, considering we are the biggest pack, we would have bigger hearts. But sadly that's not the case. Our Alpha, Alpha Chad, has been completely blindsided by the fact that I'm technically the packs punching bag. I've been teased and picked on ever since I fell into a depression after my parents died from a rogue attack when I turned five.
Daniel has been distant, well everyone has and now he's become more aggressive with me. Thankfully school is over so there will be no bullying in the halls.
Not only does Daniel become physical with me, but the whole pack does. I do everything around our pack. Including the laundry, dishes, taking care of pups, and any other mess because I'm afraid of the beating that will come if I don't. Well now that you've got an insight to my pathetic life, here's the story of it....
