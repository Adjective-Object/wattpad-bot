(Y/N) was sitting in front of her upstairs widow looking at all the 'Kids' that were having fun. (Y/N) scoffed "What's the point of having fun when we're all gonna die soon enough..." (Y/N) ticked but let out a soft sigh, '(Y/N). What makes you happy?' The voices in her head asked her. She sat there quietly thinking. "Death. Death is the only thing that'll make me happy." The voices were quite and (Y/N) just smiled, "I'm kidding! The only thing that makes me happy is talking to you!" 'But I am a voice inside your head. How come?' (Y/N) shakes her head, not responding to the Voices. But something catches her attention. A boy in his mid 18's walks up to (Y/N), (Y/N) the other hand was studying this boy. He's wearing orange-like goggles with a smile-like facemask, he had a stripe-like sweatshirt with gloves on. He had what it looked like, dark grey pants on with black & white shoes. But one thing that caught her eye. His rusty/shinny hatches. The boy bended down to see (Y/N)'s face, but she sorta backed up, but to see the boy just ticked! She tilted her head to the side to hear the boy mumbling, one thing she caught was "She probably thinks its creepy" once she heard that, she immediately ticked. "H-how did you get into my house, sir?" She asked politely, "I lock-picked your door and go-" He facepalmed and sighed, "I will see you soon, (Y/N)..." Then he just vanished!? 'Oh lord' The Voices inside my head just gasped. "Ya know... He was kinda cute..." (Y/N) caught what she said and hitted her head with her palm.
