It was cold.... So cold.in the psychiatric ward and I couldn't fall back asleep.
I tossed and I turned on the small uncomfortable bed, giving up I looked to the wall in front of me with the round white clock.It showed it to be a quarter after two in the morning, I closed my eyes and tried to fall back asleep, but then I felt it...... The most horrifying sensation that someone alone could feel.
Somebody watching you, when nobody else is supposed to be up.
I've been feeling that sensation for awhile now....
Ever since that night.....that horrible, horrible night.
The night dark ominous eyes watched me sleep, while my mothers body laid Butchered in the next room beyond recognition.
That's when I heard it.... An eerie but soft voice say into the darkness.
Go.....To.......Sleep Beth!
I opened my eyes and shook when I saw a dark figure sitting on the corner of my small bed.
I couldn't see his face just the back of his white hoodie.
I swallowed hard and spoke with a shaky voice through gritted teeth.
J-J-Jeff.......?
