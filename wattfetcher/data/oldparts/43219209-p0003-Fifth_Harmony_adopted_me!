He looked my way and smiled. "Way to go, big Al." That was his nickname for me. I could hear the girls 'aww' behind me. I forgot they were still here. He slid down from his bed - I didn't even realise how tall he was for a 14 year old. Maybe he's grown - it's been a day since I've seen him. Boys grow pretty fast at that age, right?
We hugged, ignoring the "eww" from the boys and "aww" from the girls. I felt the tears coming. No. No stupid tears. This is supposed to be a happy moment. Happy. Gimme H, gimme A, gimme P,... here they come.
"Kid. Kid. Al." said Tyler, rubbing my back. "You'll be okay."
"I... I'll just miss you." I sobbed into his chest. "Th.. thank you. For being my friend."
Tyler smiled and looked behind me. "Are these the folks?"
I nodded. Yep. These were the folks. The folks that saved me. From the things I didn't even know happened. But you'll discover that pretty soon, don't worry.
"What... what if.. Joanna..."
Tyler put his hand on my mouth. A finger would be so romantic, but no, a hand is just a clear indicator I should probably shut up. "She won't do anything. Don't worry about her. You deserve this, Al. How long have you been here?"
"T..twelve years." I sobbed through my tears.
Tyler nodded. "Exactly. And you know damn well that I never let Joanna do anything. And she won't do anything to anyone now." I saw Dinah Jane frown at that statement.
I sighed. I never told Tyler that his standing up to our manager didn't exactly do much - it only made things worse. But it made Tyler think he was a big hero. When it all started, sometimes he'd ask me every day if she touched me. And I always said no. I'm such a good liar I should get somekind of an award for this.
After a few hard minutes of goodbyes, I let Tyler go and turned to my new family. I saw Lauren come back, with papers in her hands, smiling. I guess she was my new mom. Except I'll never call her that, ever. No one can take my real mother away from me, not even a popular girl group.
"So kid, are you ready to get out of here?"
