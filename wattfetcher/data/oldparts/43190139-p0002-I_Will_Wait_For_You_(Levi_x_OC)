Lyla found herself staring blankly at a wall, 'We're all going to die...' She thought solemnly to herself.
"Lyla! Snap out of it! We got to get to the boats!" Armin shook his twin.
She looked to him, behind him was a monster. Easily eleven meters tall.
She rose a shaky hand and pointed to the smiling beast, who was reaching for someone in an alley.
Armin snapped his head to look at what she was gesturing to. His eyes widened, and he just picked up his twin and ran off to the boats.
The two stood in line, Lyla staring ahead and Armin frantically looking around for his friends.
They boarded the boat and finally found the duo that Armin had been searching for.
They both were simply facing forward, much like Lyla. Armin couldn't get a word out of either. However, Lyla slowly put the pieces together.
As the boat entered the tunnel to the next wall, her frightened eyes slowly began to shut. She soon began to drift off into an uneasy sleep.
Her home was now gone, her dreams shattered, and some unknown strength was awoken within her.

A/N
OK!
Yay for prologues!
I binged Attack On Titan SO HARD. Everytime Levi showed up, I would scream "LEVI SENPAI!" really loudly.
So that's why I'm writing a Levi x OC one now.
That's what happens when you binge.
Please don't hate!
Also, this is going to be following the anime, I've never read the manga so I'm not sure if it's that different, so you have been advised.
Enjoy my Jellies~
