The next day Alexa went to her house before my aunt and uncle came.I was in the washroom taking a shower when I heard Saira "Hey Aisha!I am ordering pizza from your phone mines on charge" "Okay!".After a while after getting dressed I came out to see Saira looking at my phone in shock .I came up to her she was looking at the part of Perrie and that guy.I had totally forgot about it with the Alexa problem I couldn't remember a thing ."I am sorry Saira with the Alexa problem I couldn't tell you!" "It is okay!But we have to tell the press!" "We can't!I think we should send this to Zayn himself first we should let him decide what he wants to do!" "Do you have the address?" "Yeah!Alexa is a directioner she told me to send a package once to his house in Bradford.I still have the address!" .We burned the specific part of the video on a CD and mailed it to the address.I hope we did the right thing.

End Of Flash Back

Let's just hope that I never have to face anyone nor Perrie or Zayn otherwise I will die of guilt even if I have done the right thing.But still I feel sorry for Zayn he really loved Perrie he even left the band for her and this is what he get's in return.
