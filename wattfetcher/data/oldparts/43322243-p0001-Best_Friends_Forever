(Elsa)
"Elsa", Anna said softly. "Yes, Anna," I replied. "Can't sleep. C-can you sing me a lalubuy." "Of course." I went to check on Kristoff he was wide awake too.
I sang to both of them :When the sun comes out tomorrow, The birds will sing their song.When the sun comes out tomorrow,
The puppies will play all day.When the sun comes out tomorrow, All the horses will neigh.When the sun comes out tomorrow,We will play all day.But when the day slows down,The night will come.And when the night comes,We go to sleep.(I made up this song to sing my two restless brothers to sleep)
She closed her eyes and drifted off into a peaceful sleep. I went to check on Kristoff again. He was fast asleep too. "Goodnight little ones," I whispered as I entered my room.(Jack)
I love Elsa's voice. It is always sweet and calm. Especially when she sings. Every night she sings a lalubuy to get Anna and Kristoff to go to sleep. She doesn't know it but, she helps me sleep to. :-)
