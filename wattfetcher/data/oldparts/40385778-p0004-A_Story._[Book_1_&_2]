My mouth went wide open. Freddy and the others looked at me strangely."Umm.. Kathy..?"
"Olivi... Oliva... She can yell and do stuff like that?!"
"Yeah... I heard that she stayed in the same grade twice because she flunked."
The bell for the next period began, and my eyes widened. "T-that must be my next class period! I gotta go, bye now!"
•~~~•~~~•
That was a day! I sighed in relief.Of course, I came home safely, and smiled."I'm home!"
My big sister, Nicole, popped out from the living room."Hi, how was school?"
"It was... Pretty tiring for a first day."
She walked up to me, and patted my head."Well, at least you had a good day."
"Yeah..."
"Oh, and hey, as a 21-year-old adult-ish female, I must ask you a question."
"Since you added such unusual words, I can tell this is very important."
"What happens, if someone ripped your bunny plushie in half, but by accident..?"
"Depends on how I feel."
"Karley ripped it in half by accident."
"I forgive her. At least it wasn't Ricardo or Mitchell."
"You knew people visited this household?"
"As long as I'm not seen. Great great grandfather would be very disappointed if my identity was spread in public. All they know, is that my name is just Kathy. And nothing else."
"Patt was a wise man."
"He was?"
"Yep. He used to fight like Manny Pacquiao. Not really, but just to defend himself. He had a good life."
"Ahhh... I get it. He was a boxer!"
"N-no! Not like that! I mean, he had the strength similar to the famous boxer... And he had the brains similar to the smartest person in the world!"
"Wow..."A sister bond indeed.
