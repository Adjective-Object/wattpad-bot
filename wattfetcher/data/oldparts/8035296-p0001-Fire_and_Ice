It was a cold, winter day.  The sun was bright, the sky was full of clouds.  Birds didn't chirp.  There was a cave, dark and cold.  A wolf pup and his mother. The mother of the pup, Stone, was feeding her pup.  She kept him warm, and cozy.  But he always seemed jumpy.  Like, he knew something bad was going to happen.  But, Stone seemed to ignore it.
"My little pup, what will I call you?"  Stone smiled, she looked at his bright blue eyes.
"I shall call you, Ice."  Ice looked at Stone.  He opened his eyes.
"Hello."  Ice said to Stone.
"Hello, my sweet pup."  Stone smiled and licked his ear clean.
"Are you my mother?"  He asked.
"Yes."  I answered him, Ice yapped and jumped and snuggled with her.  He was so fragile.  Stone looked outside, the storm of winter was getting worse.
"We must go further.  The storm is getting worse."  Stone said softly to Ice.
Ice put his head onto his paws.  He sighed.  He had fallen asleep.  His mother looked guilty at him, then looked away.  Everything his mother had done was right, but one day, that would all change.  Ice felt a burn in his heart.  Then it got cold.  Ice ignored it all.  He just wanted to sleep, and sleep, and sleep.  He drifted into a dream of wolves like him playing around.  They all sang their howls.  He smiled.  And all was left was the dripping of the ice in the cave, and the howling of the snow storm.
Stone stared at the entrance of the cave.  She thought for a moment.  I'm not ready to take care of this pup.  What if I do somehting wrong?  I'm not ready!  I never will be...  Stone weeped and feel asleep.
Stone saw starry wolves walk up to her.  They seemed kind, wise and strong.  Stone stepped back for percausion.  They stared at her, and sat down.
"Hello, Stone."  The first wolf said.  They had emerald green eyes, and a faint redish brown pelt.
"Uh...  H- hi..."  Stone replied.  "Wh- who are you?"
''We are the wolves of Moonpack.  The ancestors of the two packs.  I see you're just a loner."  The second wolf answered.
"Yes, I'm a loner.  And I know about the packs, but never encountered them."
"We have a message about your pup,"  The third wolf said, with a spark of warning.  "There will be a storm.  A storm greater than you've ever seen.  A wolf with the name of Ice of the winter will be the only one to stop it."  Stone's eyes went wide.
"I can't deal with that!"  Stone growled.  But they had vanished.
Stone shot up awake.  She stared at her little, white pup.  She braught him closer to her.  She stared at the entrance, and the snow they drifted into the den.  "You're safe my little pup.  You're safe."  She said quietly to him.  "You're safe."
