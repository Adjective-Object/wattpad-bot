It was September and the Sun was like a cracked egg; sizzling on a large frying pan.The wind pushed itself passed the trees; and the leaves on them trembled and fell sleepily , into a bed of brown leaves already on the concrete floor.The shops had just opened and the bakery opened its' doors to reveal the sweet and comforting smell , of freshly baked crossiants and doughnuts.Suddenly the crunching of leaves, underneath the feet of school children sounded.Then the excited chatter and loud laughter boomed down the streets; causing the desolation of silence that once lived.
A group of girls stood by the school gates, one of them being Rose Thornton.She was the pack leader, or as most people would put it - the mean girl.Her beauty had the power to destroy and her popularity could create whatever she wanted.Rose got whatever she wanted and when she did nobody could stop her."I had the most wonderful summer" she exclaimed to her pose as they looked at her with admiration."I broke up with Derek, after he took me to that lovely trip to Paris " she said casually ,while picking at her nails.Jennifer who was one of the many girls that followed Rose like a lost puppy , said "but I thought you said he was the one".Sighing she replied "that's what I thought too, but then sadly I found out he was a cheating bitch!" - her voice had lowered into a dry whisper. Everyone around her gasped , then there was an unusual silence broken by the ringing of the school bell.Everyone walked into the school halls.
At the lockers Rose got out her books from her locker. Frustrated  that she couldn't find her science book she pushed everything to the side, then they collapsed falling into a pile on the floor.
Slamming her locker shut she bent down to rearrange her books."I read in teen vogue that it's okay to be angry after a break up" said Jennifer , appearing out of nowhere.
Rose groaned inwardly." I. AM. NOT. ANGRY."she hissed.
