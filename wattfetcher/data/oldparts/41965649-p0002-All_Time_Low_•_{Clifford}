so this is chapter 1 of my new book and series. each book will be about a different 5sos boy. basically the girl and (ex.) Luke meet over a social network. each story will have a different plot line so it will be different each book.
1: All Time Low • Clifford2: Green Day • Irwin3: The Offspring • Hemmings4: Sublime • Hood
basically they bond over a certain band they like and eventually meet up.
hope you enjoy the series :)
