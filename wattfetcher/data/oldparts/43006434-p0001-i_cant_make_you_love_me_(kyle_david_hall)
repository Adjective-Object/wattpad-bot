I stood up facing him it's just us nothing else...
I woke up, I have been having this dream ever since half term and I don't know why or who is with me. I walked down the crowded corridor of this hell a stupid excuse of a school. I pulled up my hoodie and carried on, I wasn't that social I mean I prefer being around my "squad" I got my phone out and plugged my ear phones in blasting my music.
At break I walked to the hall waiting for my group my best friends; Emily, kyle, Johnnie, Louie, Jordan and me.
Emily and I have been friends ever since year 7 she came to this school with no friends at all and it turned out me and her where a lot a like. Then there's kyle I don't know why but I prefer him the most I guess he's always been there, every one else has but with him it's different.
"Yo Megan"
"Hey kyle what's up"
"Nothing much hey do you wanna go out after school"
"I can't today how bout tomorrow"
"Sure"
I hugged him and I didn't realize how long til he struggled out of my grasp I awkwardly laughed and
I looked at him, his hair, his eyes, his lips, all of him was perfect. Wait what am I thinking I can't think about him like this. I got a sudden urge in my stomach like something was flying, I just wanted to rip open my stomach and Stop it, I looked at kyle and it hit me I was having dreams about him.
I got home watched some YouTube videos and slept :)
----dream-----
I looked up it was black all of it, I saw him I don't know why he's just stuck in my mind I looked down at my stomach it started moving I ignored it I took his hand and we walked for hours on end. I looked back down at my stomach it had now starting inflating and it wouldn't stop. BANG. Butterflies flew out, what is this feeling I don't understand it...
Could this be...
LOVE...
