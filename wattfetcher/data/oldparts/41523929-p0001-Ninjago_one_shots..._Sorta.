Don't read this!

You heard me, if you want to keep your innocence, I do NOT recommend reading this. It is KaixLloyd.
Be warned.
I was never good at writing this sort of stuff. Anyways, if you made it this far without getting bored and walking away, I guess you deserve to read this. But still!
You have been warned...


(This takes place when they were on the dark island)


"Arg! I hate this!" That was Kai. He was pretty pissed with this whole situation. Lloyd had been coming into his room the past few nights. He insisted that it was because he couldn't sleep, but he never fell asleep anyways.
Right now, they were trying to find something to eat. They were all starving. "Why can't Lloyd just fight his dad and get this over with?" They were all thinking that, but Kai was the only one who said it out loud. "I mean, sure, Garmadon IS his dad, but come on!" Yep, just keep complaining Kai. They eventually collected enough food for all of them, and started the long trek back to camp.

"Hey Lloyd, aren't you gonna eat?" Cole asked him. Lloyd just shook his head, and trudged off to his room.

Kai knocked on his door. "Hey kiddo. Mind if I come in?" Lloyd just curled up tighter on his bed, and grunted. "I'm guessing that's a yes." Kai plopped himself next to Lloyd, and started to rub his back. "Sooo, I guess this must be pretty hard on you, huh?" Lloyd just shook a little. Kai was kinda worried, so he pulled the blanket off. "L-Lloyd..." He was definitely crying, his eyes were red and puffy, and tears were streaming down his cheeks. "Oh Lloyd..." Kai couldn't stand seeing him like this. He pulled Lloyd close, and kissed his forehead. Lloyd tensed up, then hugged Kai back. Then Lloyd whispered real quietly, "I love you..." Kai just smiled to himself, then pulled Lloyd even closer. He felt so bad! There was nothing to make him feel better. Except... "Ya know kid, I know how to cheer you up." Lloyd looked up at Kai. "How?" Kai chuckled to himself. "Just hold still okay?" "Uh, okay..." He pulled off lLloyd's shirt, and smirked. "No wonder you afraid to face your dad. You don't even have presentable abs." Lloyd blushed hard. "Kai, that doesn't even make sense..." "Whatever!" Then he pulled off his own shirt. Lloyd stared, and Kai smirked again. "Heh, like what you see?" "Uh, uhuh." Then he slipped off Lloyd's pants, and Lloyd whimpered a bit. "Kai..." "Shh, don't worry. No one will find us." Then he slipped off his own, then his underwear. Lloyd gasped. "Yeah, I thought you'd do that." He smiled. "You're next." He pulled off Lloyd's. And Lloyd yelped. "Shhh, if you're that loud they'll find us. Now, you have to be quiet, okay?" Lloyd nodded, and Kai crawled on top of him. "K-K-Kai... What are you..."  "Heh, look who's talking." Then it began. (Ugh, why am I writing this?!) He positioned himself at Lloyd's entrance, and went for it. "ahh, Kai!" Kai smirked, and went faster. "Aaahhhh! K-K-Kai! Please!" "What's the matter?" Kai asked between breaths. "You want me to stop?" Lloyd shook his head. "N-no. Just... Ahh! Go faster!" (Oh gosh, I don't know if I can do this. I feel so dirty.) "Okay, but only since you asked." They were both breathing heavily now, and Lloyd was about ready. "Ahhh! Kai!" "L-Lloyd!" They both toppled over onto Lloyd's bed. They just lay there for a while panting. "Well," Kai said, "what did you think? On a scale of one to ten." Lloyd was quiet for a minute. "............nine.... Honestly, I like just being with you better, but that was definitely a close second." "Heh, good... Well, what now?" Lloyd stared off into space. So many things were running through his mind right now. He snuggled up to Kai, and fell asleep.






Whew! Glad that's over!
I tried to tell you, I'm not good at writing this type of stuff! I always feel weird about writing that. Anyways! I hope you didn't hate it, if you did, please DON'T TELL ME!!!!! If you loved it... Well, that's your problem.
