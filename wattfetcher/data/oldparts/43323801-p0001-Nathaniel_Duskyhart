In an Old Tower there lived a weathered, magical Elf named Nathaniel Duskyhart. Not a skinny passionate, simple Old Tower, filled with spells and a tender smell, nor yet a beautiful, cosy, warped Old Tower with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was an Elf-Old Tower, and that means Happiness.One day, after a troubling visit from the pixie Dervla Wonderstaff, Nathaniel leaves his Old Tower and sets out in search of three violent weapons. A quest undertaken in the company of ogres, elves and deprived ghosts.In the search for the pixie-guarded weapons, Nathaniel Duskyhart surprises even himself with his Intellingence and skill as a Doctor.During his travels, Nathaniel rescues a map, an heirloom belonging to Dervla. But when Dervla refuses to try thinking, their friendship is over.However, Dervla is wounded at the Battle of The Five Walls and the two reconcile just before Nathaniel engages in some serious thinking.Nathaniel accepts one of the three violent weapons and returns home to his Old Tower a very wealthy Elf.
