It was a peaceful Wednesday night when I went to bed. My husband, John, strolled out of the master bath, a towel swishing around his waist. "Emily, I can't believe that you didn't even wash my pair of socks!!!" John growled. "Oh, honey, I'm sorry! It slipped from my mind. I totally forgot. I'll do them first thing in the morning." I replied, trying to avoid a fight. "Well, MAYBE you haven't thought about the fact that I don't WANT to wait. I have a meeting in the morning and I need my new socks." John snarled. This was all too much for me. With the baby boy on the way, I was already a little bit snappy and just the other night me and John had gotten into a fight. I was too tired for another night like last night. All I truly wanted was a good night's sleep. "You know what, John?" I asked, trying desperately to keep my anger out of my voice. "What now?" John snapped. That was it. I exploded. Looked like my "good night's sleep" wasn't going to be happening tonight. "John, you can just take your lazy ass DOWNSTAIRS, and stick your god damn socks in the washer. I'm PREGNANT, and it's my daily workout to get up and down the stairs. I'm wiped out, and theirs NO CHANCE I'm going to work my ass downstairs for your dumb socks." I'd exploded. Too late now. "Take your lazy ass downstairs right this moment or else. " John threatened. So I went downstairs and as I was working my way down the steap steps, I felt cold water trickle down my leg. All of a sudden, my stomach burst into pain."John! My water broke!" I hollered. "God dammit." I heard John mumble. John came running down the hall with his pants around his ankles, his hair a frizzy mess. He assisted me down the last few stairs and out the door, his keys in his hands. He turned the keys into the ignition, and sped down the road that us two had once drove upon, a happy young couple seeking a home to settle down in.
