The door slid open, revealing a girl- a girl no one knew. She drifted silently into the room, recognised by no one. Her hair blew elagantly behind her, the wind coming from the open window one desk away from me. I looked around the room, but the teacher and the students continued to work, not noticing the girl pulling up the chair next to me. My eyes were fixiated on her.
Her legs were sat crossed, her head leaning on her hand and looking out the window. Her deep, purple eyes skit across the outside, observing students walking past and chatting. Eyes, such stunning eyes, slowly turned to look at me. I jumped a little and felt my face burn up. She gazed at me; differently from when she looked at the outside, for she was not observing or judging, she was smiling. Her eyes smiled. I found myself staring too intently, and I didn't noticeÂ  the teacher standig beside my desk with a questioning look. I jumped and began to stutter a few words that even myself couldn't understand. Without a word, the teacher placed the paper on my table, with my test results on.
86%. A good result. I looked to my side to see the girl, who was still staring. I wish she would stop already. I gave her a weak smile and she finally looked away. As soon as her eyes were gone, I felt as if I was lifted from a spell that fixiated my whole sight and being to her. The air felt boring and dark like it usually did, and for the rest of the day no one noticed the girl.
I'll edit this later, but this is it so far! X
