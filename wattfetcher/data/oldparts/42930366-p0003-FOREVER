"Good luck at that performance tonight." I whisper in his ear. He looks at me, intrigued but horrified. Having stopped aging my long life has giving me broad knowledge and remarkable observation skills which impress most people I come across.
"How did you-" He begins but I cut him off. "Your collar is damp, freshly showered. So I assumed you were heading to work or a date. But then I noticed the idents on you fingers. At first I thought violin but then there was no mark on your chin so cello." I explained to him.
His reaction was impressed. "Well, thank you." He says and stands as his stop approaches. "Would you like to come?" He asks me. I stand up across from him, "I would love to." I agree and he leans in close to my lips. We're about to kiss, just as he lands on my lips, a loud screch followed by a crash. Lights flicker, people fall, people scream! I'm knocked over and fall into my seat. Something hits me hard in the gut. I don't dare to look down. One more yank on the train and we all fall to the ground, bloody and on shattered glass.
I close my eyes, amd sigh. "Oh, God." When I look beside me, I see the handsome man I just met beside me. He has a huge scratch that'll kill him on his neck. He is staring at me, jaw dropped. At my stomach. I look down, a rail impaled me, it's stuck. I'm bleeding. My one arm is extended to grasp my watch but I can't reach. I hear sirens.
"Oh no." I whimper. Nobody can see, nobody will survive. A bunch a dead people won't tell anybody what they saw.
So I look one last time at that man, he is barely hanging on. I put both hands on the pole and stab it in my stomach further. And further, until the world goes... black.
