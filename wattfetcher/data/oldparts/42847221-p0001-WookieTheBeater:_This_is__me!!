Hello everybody, I'm Wookie, and I want to start my diary asking you a little question: why are you interested to know more about me? Did you like my Reader Insert stories and wanted to know more? Are you some CIA or FBI agent that's looking for some criminal and is wondering if I am a good or bad person? I don't know so I am asking you.
I'm doing this story becouse I noticed that many good authors I like are starting similar things, so I wanted to try... but since I don't have many things people need to know, I'll just write whatever I'm thinking and feeling, hoping to not bore you to death....
About me I can tell you I am a girl, I was born in December in the 1996, and I live In Italy, even tough I know nothing more than the survival necessary in the art of cooking.
I'm studying to become an Informatic engeneer and specialize in computer graphics, then when I will be ready go to work In Japan or America and finally be able to realize my dream...
I want people to see my works and be able to feel the same emotion I felt when I looked up their works, I want to make people be able to dream as they teached me to do when I was standing hopeless.
I WANT TO GIVE EMOTIONS.
Another thing that you should know is that I love Anime, Manga, Fantasy, Action and Adventures Books and Films and super Heroes Comics.
I started writing when I was sixteen, becouse I needed to recover from a breakup, I wrote a little page on my school workbook that responded to the title "Kiss me to wake me up", that told about how a girl named Lyra that was in a bus sitted near her best friend Mark, but when they actually arrived at their stop she realized her friend was asleep and to wake him up she kissed him. Then she ran away from the shock when he actually woke up, just to be stopped by Mark who pulled Lyra close to him and kissed her.
Maybe I should write that story up again I mean, as a one-shot or something, if you want me to just say it and I'll do it! ^^
