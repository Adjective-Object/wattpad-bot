Emma's pov
"Emma, wake up." Sean said.
I shot up from my bed and said "what is it?"
"The crew and I are going to L.A. It's where we could get bigger at. We want you to come." Sean said
"Sean I can't, I'm not leaving mom, dad, or Austin. I just can't do it Sean. You and the mob mean so much to me, but I can't leave people behind." I said.
"Please, Em. Were gonna need you." Sean begged.
"Sean, I said no. I'm sorry." I said.
Sean nodded and grabbed his suit cases. They were taken outside and put in our friend Ed's car.
I ran up to Sean and hugged him. Tears filling my eyes.
"Promise you'll call." I said.
"Promise." Sean said hugging me back.
Sean pulled away and walked towards the car. He sat down and drove off to start a new life.
(2 years later)
I was sitting in my room waiting for the call from Sean I knew I wasn't going to get. I wasn't just waiting for that, I was waiting for my parents.
2 hours had passed and my parents weren't home. I picked up my phone about to call my mother when my dad called.
"Dad?" I asked.
"Is this Emmilee?" Someone asked.
"Yes." I answered.
" I'm sorry honey , your parents got into and accident and they have passed." The man said.
Tears were rushing down my face as the man hung up the phone. I called Sean but it went straight to voicemail as usual.I called Austin and he said I could move in with him.
I packed what I needed and drove to Austin's. He hugged me  and helped me get things sorted.
"Thanks Austin." I said.
"Anything for my baby." Austin said.
I smiled and walked upstairs to get sleep.
(3 months later)
Things in Florida weren't so good for me. I because depressed and Austin started drinking to much. He usually came home everyday drunk. I was usually abused and bleeding. One morning when Austin wasn't drunk I sat down to talk to him.
"Austin, you have beat me to the point where I'm breathing while I'm dead. I don't want to be with a man like that, I don't want to be with you anymore. I've become depressed and I need to see family right now. Things between us aren't working out. I'm breaking up with you." I said.
"YOU WILL NOT LEAVE ME." Austin shouted. I then felt a hand across my cheek and was out cold.
I woke up and looked around to make sure Austin was gone. I grabbed all of my belongings and called a taxi.
After being picked up by the taxi I went to the airport and bought a ticket to L.A.
(After plane)
I texted Ed when I got off the plane and asked him where they practiced.
He told me where and I called a taxi to take me.  I got to the building and walked inside.  Luckily I was wearing  dance clothes so I walked upstairs to the room they practiced in and opened the door.
Sean was teaching a few moves to someone so he didn't look back. I put my bags down and ran up to Sean jumping on his back.
