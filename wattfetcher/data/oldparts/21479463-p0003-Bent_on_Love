"No."
"Well that is your goal tomorrow, okay Harry?" She said.
"Shouldn't I be focused on schooling?" Harry said, finally closing the book and looking at his mother.
"Well, yes, but please try Harry. I know you probably think it's pointless but please," she answerd.
Hearing his mother plea like that he sighed, "Fine."
She smiled and gave him a squeeze before exiting. Harry opened up his book and continued reading.
Meanwhile, Louis sat at the dinner table, trying to figure out Harry. Or more, trying to figure out how to reach out to Harry. How could a guy like Louis talk to a guy like Harry without being accused of either being gay or replacing his old friends?
Was he gay? The thought crossed his mind for a split second before moving on to something else.
His phone buzzed as his girlfriend, Kennedy, tried calling him. He picked it up and before he could say hello, she was already talking.
The conversation was mostly Kennedy talking and Louis saying, "Mhm" or "Of course" and the occasional, "How could she do that?"
Once she finally finished, Louis did his best to end the call as polietly but quickly as possible.
"I've really gotta go babe, I have tons of homework," Louis said.
"Get a nerd to do it. That's how it works in the movies," Kennedy pouted, wanting to talk to Louis longer.
"This isn't the movies, and I should really be going," Louis insisted. He heard her sigh over the line.
"Fine, but you'll call me once you're done." She said, making it more of a fact.
"Of course I will, bye." Louis hung up and went back to trying to talk to Harry. It seemed so childish to be making a plan to talk to some kid he barely knew. But it was what Louis wanted to do, and Louis could do what he wanted.
Well, occasionally.
