*Riley*
"Yasss last day of school!" I jump on Alex's back.
"Hey!" Alex says in a sassy voice.
"What? Chill yo-self it's just me?!" I laugh almost falling off his back.
"Ohh I thought you were that bitch Makenna who likes me and wants my attention but you know I don't like her I like uhh..." He stutters.
"Yea I know you like," I giggle, "you like Kendall Jenner." I laugh that the whole hall way shuts up.
"Yea that's exactly who I like." He laughs nervously.

AFTER LUNCH
"Hey Cayla is Alex ok? He seems distracted."
"Yea I think maybe it's that final that we have."
"Like he gives a shit about that." I laugh.
"Than idk sorry boo." She's says and than hugs me and goes to her 5th period class.
5th period is social studies for me but for Cayla it's science so she's up stairs learning about guts, while I sit in my seat across from Alex while we be sexual and make a hole with our fingers and stick out pointer finger through. That's just us.
"Hey Alex why is Mr.Piesten so rude and annoying af?" I say across the room in a whisper voice.
"Idk why don't you ask him." He said joking.
--------------------------
AFTER 5TH PERIOD
Me and Alex always walk out together but this time was different...
"I can't fucking wait for school to be ov." I'm interrupted by someone grabbing my butt.
"Omg I'm soo sorry Riley I didn't me too." He says embarrassed.
But wht he doesn't know is that I liked it.
