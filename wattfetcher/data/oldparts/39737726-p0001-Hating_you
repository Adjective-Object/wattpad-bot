Hi my name is Laura Waters and I'm what you would call, a dork. I like books, sue me. Any ways my dad went to buy groceries and I was left to watch Music Mania( our music store) everything was awesome until the biggest jerk in my school entered the shop. Luckily I didn't have to deal with Ross Lynch. My dad came back right in time to deal with him. Now I like writing songs but I'm too shy to sing them so I just write them. I ran into the practice room upstairs and I was in the middle of my song when my best friend Rain yelled." guess what."" what now."" Ross Lynch has a new song."" so what."" why do you hate him so much."" because he's a jerk and thinks he can get any girl he wanted."" ok but please just listen to it."" fine." I did and it was my song, Ross Lynch stole my song.
