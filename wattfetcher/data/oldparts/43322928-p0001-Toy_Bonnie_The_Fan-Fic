Toy Bonnie's POV
It started as a normal day. Toy Chica and Mangle were still being made. I was talking to Toy Freddy about the ones in the back. He started saying that they are used for parts, and that I have Old Bonnie's face. The workers let us walk around for the whole day. I went over into the game room and say a child. It started to laugh and say "Hello" and "Hi". I just walked away and I couldn't wait for the kids to walk in. I went back on stage and went into "Sleep Mode"
=========================================================================
I woke up and start to see kids. I picked up my guitar and started playing. I saw Mangle in Kids Cove. I started to feel bad for her. But she wasn't part of the crew. I saw to kids walk in and I thought they were so cute.  The girl's hair was long light brown hair parted to the right side.She was wearing  normal plaid dress, star tights, black boots , pale skin and hazel eyes. The boy had short black hair. He was wearing  a Foxy T-Shirt and blue jeans with black glasses. He also had blue Converse Shoes.
They started to sit in the Toy Bonnie area so they could see me better. I then got off stage to go see Mangle and ask her is she ok but she didn't reply. Then the place started to close and then came in some strange man. I just stayed on stage but everyone else went to go see him.
