Hiya pretty peoples. I actually got the idea of writing this story based off of @fluffycashton 's book titled 'Walls'. It's a really good book and I recommend reading it. Anyways, I really hope I enjoy writing this book, I deleted an old one because I never updated on it so maybe this will be a fresh start. Please don't corrrect any spelling errors or grammer erors, I'm a horrible speller. Also please note, I'm ONLY writhing this story on Wattpad, so if you see it any where else on any other social midea or anywhere please notify me. Thanks. Ily. Stay Pretty Peoples and Stay Srtong. -Maddie xxGet in touch?Instagram- mm.add.ieeTwitter- maddienorberggAsk.Fm- maddie_norberg
