It's midnight. And I'm STILL watching YouTube. I'm just watching Jc Caylen videos. OH MY GOD, I LOVE HIM. I never met him or any famous people. I know. Sad, right? Right now, I'm watching Just Girly Things. This video makes me laugh sooo hard.
Oh, yeah, My name is Emma Rose, and I am obsessed with o2l. Specifically, Jc Caylen. I'm 5'6, so I'm pretty short. I own a galaxy pennyboard named Starry. I ride it everyday. I have dark brown hair that ends just before my butt. I'm 19 years old, which is Kian's age. I still live with my parents because I decided not to go to college. So, I can't afford to buy my own house. Also, I live in San Diego, California. Okay, let's get back to the story, shall we?
The video ended and I checked the time. My alarm clock read 12:24 AM. I should probably get to sleep...nah. Next, I go on Twitter. My username is @EmmaxCaylen ( it's not real ). I saw a picture that Kian posted on Twitter. @kianlawley tweeted: "aww the little baby is sleeping üò¥" and it showed a picture of Jc snoozing away like an angel. I want to sleep with Jc Caylen. One day, one day.
I spent hours with my eyes staring at my laptop screen. The only light source was my laptop. I checked the time again. It was 4:45 AM. Oops. I guess I need to go to sleep now. Goodnight.----------------------------------------------omggg!! my first fanfic on wattpad!! my first chapter!! sorry, it's short. and sorry, if it's lame :/ I gotta sleep now, so comment your opinions about this chapter! and don't forget to vote! ily üíïbyeeeeesss ‚úåüèªÔ∏è -E
