Warnings were going off in my head.
You shouldn't be doing this. It's dangerous. Where will you end up after everything happens?
I didn't know why I was doing it. I had absolutely no answers for that.
Light flashed from the light poles that no longer functioned as well as they used to. They seemed like an accurate representation of families and the entire city.
You can't turn back after this. I knew it was true. Once this was done, I'd be on my own.
The night's humid air blew wisps of hair into my face, catching ever so slightly in my mouth and upon my eyelashes. The weather would grow stronger if I didn't hurry.
If they didn't hurry, I reminded myself.
Luckily enough, I began to feel vibrations beneath my feet. The train was coming. I had to be quick. One wrong step, and I could easily be killed.
Or worse; I'd have to go back to the city to let them decide my punishment. Honestly, there was no way they'd show me mercy. I was a renegade.
The train whistles bellowed through the air, sending vibrations down my spine. Within a minute, the train was in my sight.
10 seconds. I breathed in hard. The wind blew harshly, assaulting my bare arms.
9. My legs began to shake, nerves shooting throughout my body.
8. 7. I felt lightheaded.
What if you miss? What if something bad happens? What if. . . you die?
4. I retreated a few steps, giving myself some space.
3. There was a certain height you had to jump to get on the train, and you had to be skilled to make it. Otherwise, you'd end up sliced in two.
2. This was it. There was only one chance. I took a deep breath, readying myself for what was I come next.
"One," I whispered harshly, sprinting forward as the train hurried by. My legs moved quickly as I focused on my target.
This is it, I thought as I jumped.
And it was.
