Today is a day where I'm all aloneTomorrow you care, no reason to moanI don't know what the future holdsWhat I do know is that I'm on my ownMy heart and soul already sold...To someone that will never careThe memories we will never shareMy life over; spent aloneWhat's the point in lasting another day?
