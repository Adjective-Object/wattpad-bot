~flashback~--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was the forth of July, little Annabelle was patiently waiting for the fireworks to begin. But suddenly something caught her attention, a firefly that lit the night sky that surrounded it. Being the five year old that she is, she was determined to chase it. She followed the firefly until something bumped into her. *BOOM* While rubbing her head, Annabelle carefully stood up to see what bumped into her. She was expecting to see a parent or someone who was much older than her. But all she saw was a boy who has beautiful blond curls and deep blue eyes. Even in the darkness, his eyes seemed to shine as bright as the stars. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to run into you. I was just trying to chase the firefly." He said softly. "That's okay, I was trying to chase the firefly too! I guess I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings. My name is Annabelle, I'm five! What's your name?""My name is Peter, I'm also five!" He said while holding up five fingers. "Peter, do you want to be best friends?" She shyly asked. "YES!" He shouted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From that day the two had been inseparable, they even ended up going to the same school and had the same classes as well. That is until ninth grade came around.When ninth grade came around, Peter gradually stopped hanging our with Annabelle. Peter later ditched her for the popular kids in school. Annabelle was clueless to why Peter stopped hanging out with her, but Peter knew why. Peter was threatened to stay away from her, if he didn't stay away someone would kill her. It killed Peter everyday to see Annabelle alone and crying. But in order to keep the one that he loved the most safe, he had to stay away from her. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I hope you guys liked the first chapter!
