Note: so this is my first justason story. It's based off one of my images. Called "daddy?" In the beginning it was going to be a women but I decided why not Have it be with Justin and Jason. So yea. Justin isn't famous in this story. ---------------------------------------
You think that women are the only ones that go through being pregnant and the baby daddy disappearing or leaving them. You think that women are the only ones who work two jobs to make ends meet. people don't realize that guys can go through this also.
Meet Justin Bieber. He is a 22 year old who works at a nike from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm just to make end meet. Some of you might be wondering why a young guy with a bright future is working at a sneaker store.
Well he has a son named Dallas Jaxson Bieber, Dal for short.
Justin was only 17 when he give birth to him. Yes Justin had given birth to a baby and the father of his child was Jason McCann.
Justin and Jason were dating for 2 years when Justin found out. Justin was scared and Jason didn't want to have a baby with Justin.
Justin remembers that day clear as day. The way Jason looked at him with the eyes of madness. He will never forget what Jason told him that day. -------------------------------------------Flashback ~
"Get an abortion I don't want that baby." Jason said clinching his jaw.
Justin didn't believe in abortion it was killing a human being it was like murder. Justin couldn't believe what Jason was saying.
"No" Justin said getting up. "I'm not aborting it. If you don't want this baby. I will raise him/her on my own. I'm not killing a innocent soul that did nothing wrong." At this point Justin had tear in his tears.
"Ok you wanna be like that alright." Jason grabbed all of Justin's stuff and through it out of the house. "If you wanna keep this baby. Then get the hell out of my house."
Justin closed his eyes and slapped Jason in the face. "I hate you I hope to never see you again. Don't come back into my life or his/hers. You are worst."
Justin walked out of the house never looking back.
~End of flashback ---------------------------------------------
