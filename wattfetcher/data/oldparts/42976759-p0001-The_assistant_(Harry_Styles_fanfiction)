HarryI sigh when I wake up in an empty bed- again. I really thought I had done something right this time. I look over and see a note on my pillow. It's a note from the girl I just, I guess you can say banged. When I open it it's the same thing that I see every time I do these kinds of things. "Dear Harry, last night was really fun. Maybe another time? Xoxox Jessica" I start to get up to quickly change into clean clothes. I first put on my black skinnies and a plain white tee. "Fuck I'm late to work" I rush to brush my teeth then I'm out the door. I start to walk quickly to the parking deck where my apartment is. I see my baby, my black motorcycle. It took about all my savings but I needed something to get around in besides walking. I get on and start it up carefully. Don't want to get a scratch on this thing anytime soon. When I pull out I be careful to make sure and pay attention to all the signs like I didn't last month. I'm still trying to pay off that ticket. When I pull into work I notice a new car parked out front. I pull in taking off my helmet and walk inside. I stop right in my tracks when I see a beautiful girl standing at the front. I walk over to her and say "Do you need anything?" I say with a smirk. She replies quickly glaring at me. "oh I'm just here to apply for one of the assistant jobs." Hmmm so an assistant huh maybe she can be mine. "So what's your name?" I ask, she replies with a short answer. "Tessa"
