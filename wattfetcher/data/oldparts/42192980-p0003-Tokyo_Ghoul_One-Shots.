"I'm so sorry for what I said yesterday!" he said, planting sloppy kisses all over my face, "Please forgive me! I was just angry! I wasn't thinking when I said those things!" his head was now resting in the crook of my neck, kissing it after every word.
"Juuzou, that thickles." his kisses didn't thickled, only his short hair that was all over my face. His head rose up, red eyes fixing on me.
"So that means that you'll forgive me?" his red eyes sparkled and he looked so beautiful in that angle. It's not normal to call a boy beautiful, but he was an exception. He was beyond beautiful. I rolled on top of him, both me and him surprised that I did that.
"Maybe."
"Not fair!"
