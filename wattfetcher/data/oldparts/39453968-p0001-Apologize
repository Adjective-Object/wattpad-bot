I stood outside my house. It was approximately 5 am and this was my only way out. I stand there. That's all I do-stand there. I remember all of the good and happy memories from when I was little. But then all the bad ones come to mind as well. Why did they have to make my life hell. Why couldn't they think before they did something. Why. This question soon became a statement in my head. Terrible memories came back, reminding my that it was okay to leave. That I had a right to. I picked up my molded, brown luggage and jumped the next train.         I didn't know where neither this train or I were going. I just got on and felt relieved. It was as if a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I didn't need to be the parents for my 6 younger siblings, I didn't have to watch my parents abuse me, and I didn't have to live with my awful family. All I knew was that I was an 18 year old runaway.
