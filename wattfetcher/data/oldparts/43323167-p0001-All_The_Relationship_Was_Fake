Carla was a new student at Diverse High School. She was 15 years old. Carla saw lots of prep girls at Diverse High School. She wanted to be one prep too, but she decided to stay regular and just be cool.
This one guy in Carla's class was always staring at Carla. Carla didn't know after she had some friends at school. She met this girl name Ashley. Ashley was nice and kind, but after all she is a prep too.Ashley was talking to Carla. Ashley said "Do you know that dude that always stare at you?" Carla said "No?.. But um... Why does he stare at me? Just like every minute he looks at me. Also, it gives me the chills." Ashley said "Well, I gotta talk to him." Carla said "Alright."
After the first class, Carla was listening to every word that Ashley went to talk to Brent after Carla was done with class. Carla heard "Why do you keep on staring at Carla? You know that she doesn't like it. Also, remember I told you that I also had a crush on you. You better not go out with her and you'll know what'll happen to her face! You got it?!" Brent said "Okay.. But I know that you liked me since 7th grade but, I got feelings for Carla now.. You gotta move on Ashley. I don't like you anymore and don't touch Carla!!"
After that Carla went to the girls restroom and cried in the bathroom. She never knew that aashley wad that kind of friend but, now she knows how Ashley is now. In Carla's head she just wanted to swear up to that "prep girl Ashley".. So then Carla just went to wipe her face with water and left the bathroom.
For that whole day Carla went home until the Bell ranged. Carla keep on thinking about what Ashley and Brent was taking about in the hallway.
