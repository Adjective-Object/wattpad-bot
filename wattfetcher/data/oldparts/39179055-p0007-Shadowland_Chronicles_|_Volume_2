Jones sat at his desk, waiting for Doc. He was waiting for his report. When Doc walked into the room moments after Jones looked up, he said, "I have my report." Jones said, "I'd like to see." Doc said, "I have the report, but I'm not done." Jones said, "Show me it, Doc." Doc sighed and handed it over. Jones observed the pages and looked at Doc. He asked, "Are you sure?" Doc said, "If one more thing happens, I'll have no choice. She'll be unstable beyond stability." Jones frowned and said, "I see...but I can't have you lock her up. If one more thing happens, we'll contain her until we find a solution. She'll remain at CPC, not at the mental facility. Am I clear?" Doc nodded and said, "Yes sir." Jones said, "Then go."
Doc nodded and left the room. Jones sighed and hoped nothing would go wrong. One more thing...and she'll lose it all, Jones thought to himself. He didn't think she'd make it this far because nobody had ever made it with her background and her past and possible future to her point. She was seventeen, and she'd been at CPC for the longest time...and she deserved something more then what she'd lived threw to just be an agent without anything but a chance to be with actual people...not just insane people.
He sighed and said to himself, "I know she's coming to her limits. It's almost time to put it all away with her into a cell."
