"Harry, please, just listen to me." I ran after him, rain falling and crashing onto the ground like glass breaking into a million pieces. Thunder crackled against the gray sky, the moon illuminating the dark path as I tried to catch up with the angered man in front of me. "Harry, I'm sorry!" I pleaded, my feet sloshing against the cement, my legs growing tired.
I was soaked from head to toe, my clothing not being enough protection from the storm erupting beyond me. My teeth chattering from the cold as I ran faster, waiting for Harry to stop, but he never did. "Harry!" I cried out, reaching my arm to touch him, beg for forgiveness. My stomach aching with guilt as I grabbed onto his sweater.
Pulling him back and facing me, his green eyes dark and hidden. His eyebrows scrunched in frustration, his brown curls in a tangled mess. He didn't meet my gaze, yanking his arm from my grasp.
"Harry, I know what I did was wrong but-" Harry laughed, the noise holding no humor as he shook his head. "Save your pathetic excuses, Blaire and leave me alone." Harry hissed, his voice so empty, so venomous. I shivered due to his tone, my arms wrapping around me, trying to create warmth as I wiped the water from my face.
Blinking away the tears as I stared at him. "Harry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that, I know, but please. I need you." I chocked out, my voice hoarse as Harry ran his fingers through his hair. Eyes glancing at me for a split second before losing contact. "Just leave." Harry murmured, turning away from me and stepping forwards.
My heart wrenched in my chest, my body wanting to collapse onto the sidewalk, my breath caught in my throat as my whole world felt like it was crashing down. My legs shaking as I followed him, I couldn't lose him, I wouldn't. "Harry, just listen to me! I have a reason as to why-" Harry whipped around, enraged.
Eyes filled with fire, green flames staring at me intensely. "Save it Blaire! You fucked up! Not one reason will ever cover up the pain you caused! The burden you put on my shoulders! You failed me!" Harry bellowed, moving closer, his proximity so near that his breath hit my cheek, my body trembling with fear.
His chest heaved up and down in annoyance, Harry's fuse burning like a wildfire. My eyes pooled with tears as he looked at me with such disgust. "You ruined everything, Blaire." Harry spat, rain splashing onto the ground, my chest aching as I took a step back.
He was done, Harry was done with me. I screwed everything up, every last chance. He hated me, all because of one stupid mistake. Tears fell from my eyes as I let out a sob, my body growing weak as Harry walked away. Not giving me a second glance.
Yet, I was determined to keep him, to make him hear me out and listen to my reason. He doesn't understand. "Harry!" I called, forcing my legs to run, so I can talk to him clearly. My limbs heavy as I moved, my body like lead as I held onto his arm. Crying as I tried to explain my mistake, but he didn't listen to one word.
"Get away from me!" Harry hollered, shoving my figure away from him. Lightning flashing across the sky, his anger like a furious war. The wrath of him opening skies and causing trouble. The Harry I tried to save, now escaping. His darkness exploding, misunderstood behavior.
The once fixed Harry. now shattered. His body shaking in madness, his eyes looking up to the skies as he clenched and unclenched his fists. The storm worsened, wind swam from all directions, making the trees sway dangerously and rattle windows.
Lightning hit close to our bodies, making me jump as I moved away from the monster. Green eyes blazing with insanity as Harry fell to the ground. Knees hitting the sidewalk, hands in his hair as he whimpered in pain.
