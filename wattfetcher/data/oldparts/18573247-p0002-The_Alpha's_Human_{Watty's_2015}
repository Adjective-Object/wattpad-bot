"I said you're coming back with us." He snarls, and I elbow him in the stomach.
"And I said I'd rather die!" I stomp on his foot, which happened to be bare and not go well with the heel of my boot, and he yelps and lets go of me.

"I said you're coming back with us." That's the last thing I hear before drifting unconscious. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Ehhh not the best an not that long but it's still something. Enjoy!Allie
