Parrish:"Let's see the pictures of the dead bodies" you said, walking into the sheriffs office."Y/n, you should be at school" he said"I have no more lessons left today" you replied, sitting in his chair. You often came into the police station, .you loved solving crimes, especially in beacon hills. You were the detective of the pack. He sighed, allowing you to stay and help out. You were looking through multiple records, searching for clues when someone walked in. "I patrolled the neighbourhood, nothing suspicious" said a guy in a uniform. You guessed it was the new deputy."Oh, hey kid." He replied, noticing that it wasn't the sheriff sat it the office."Kid?" You asked "you're not one to talk". He laughed and you decided that you would search through the files together.after searching through the the majority of boxes of files you give up."You need a lift" the deputy asked. You were unsure, but figured you could trust him. So you accepted his offer and left with him. You directed him to your house and pulled up, thanking him as you closed the door behind you."Jordan" he shouted."Y/n" You replied, turning around slightly to wave goodbye. You entered your house, stopping as you stepped into the living room.Your parents stood there, arms crossed, waiting for you to start talking. That's when you started to laugh."Don't worry, I didn't do anything wrong, the deputy just gave me a ride home. I helped out after school." You said. You could see them visibly relax."Don't scare us like that, y/n" your dad said, as he returned to his work. Whilst you walked up to your room, texting all the information about the case to the pack.
