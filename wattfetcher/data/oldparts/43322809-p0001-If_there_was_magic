If there was magic
I could make this world disseapear
Or maybe making us not to fear
The darkness in our heart,
I have so many dreams
That nobody could believe
Maybe not even me
Only thing i can say
Live youre life
And be Ok
Maybe there is magic
Somewhere in our hearts
Or maybe in our dreams
But believe i it until lasts
And if you ever will cry
Because of me
Just come and see
The side of me
That is also crying
Because of me...
