In this story Katniss and everyone else lives in District 12 however they are not poor. Everyone has plenty of food and stuff like that.

All of the characters besides the ones I made up belong to Suzanne Collins and not myself. Secondly no one is forcing you to read this story so you don't have to so don't go commenting on how sucky you think my story is. However, if you have constructive comments I will gladly keep those in mind. Also sorry that I don't have a title I am getting to that.
