A wardrobe was against the wall closest to the door leading to the sitting room. I noticed an actual door this time and walked towards it. There was a Victorian claw-foot bathtub with a toilet next to it. The large mirror had a porcelain sink below it and I decided right then and their that I had to have a bath in this bathroom using the scented soaps and shampoos.
I grabbed a silky white floor length night gown with no sleeves and a bra and underwear and set them down on the toilet with the seat down and started the water. When it reached a little bit below the brim of the tub I turned the water off and climbed in. The water scalded my skin but also invigorated me, making me sigh in contentment.
I heard a door open and grabbed the nearest thing to cover me up. Which happened to be my dry clothes. God darn it!
"Who's there?" I called hesitantly only to here some shuffling coming towards the door. The last person I expected walked through the door and smirked down at me.
"Clarissa dear, you know the Fae aren't ashamed of nudity, so why are the Shadowhunters?" the Seelie Queen said questionably. I tried to cover myself as best as possible, when a queen is smirking down at you!
"Well, uh, Your Grace? Will you get me something to sleep in please?" She smirked some more and waltzed out of the room.
A few minutes she walked back in the room with a short thigh-length white silk nightgown. I stared at the nightgown in horror and the Seelie Queen laughed at my reaction. I asked her to leave and after some more questions she finally left me alone. I let myself relax for a while before regretfully getting out and drying myself off.
As I climbed into bed I suddenly thought about my friends and family and what they were doing. I started to worry but quickly shoved my worries out of my head and let myself drift into the bliss only sleep could provide for me.
*Next Morning*
When I opened my eyes I squinted from the light coming from the chandelier which automatically turned on and off at the end of the day and the beginning of the day. Pretty darn cool if you ask me. When my eyes adjusted to the light I climbed out of bed and walked towards the wardrobe. Inside were beautiful dresses and some maxi looking skirts, and silky shirts. I picked a white dress which seemed to wrap itself around me and move as if it had a mind of its own. It was floor-length and strapless with a cinched waist which made me look as if I had more pronounced curves. I slipped on some white sandals and brushed my hair, dabbed some perfume on and peeked out the door.
I stepped out the door only to be knocked down onto my butt by a Fae woman who smiled at me kindly. I smiled up at her as she helped me up.
"I'm sorry! Are you okay?" She asked me worriedly and I just smiled at her. "It's fine, I should have payed attention." She looked relieved and said "Well, I was sent to escort you to the Queen's throne room." I nodded and she linked arms with me and we started towards the Throne Room.
