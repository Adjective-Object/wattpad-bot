That I can take away your hurt,
Heartbreak Girl,
Hold you tight straight through the daylight,
I'm right here, when you gonna realise,
That I'm your cure,
Heartbreak Girl,
I dedicate this sing to you,
The one who never sees the truth,
That I can take away your hurt,
Heartbreak Girl,
Hold you tight straight through the daylight,
I'm right here, when you gonna realise,
That I'm your cure,
Heartbreak Girl.
