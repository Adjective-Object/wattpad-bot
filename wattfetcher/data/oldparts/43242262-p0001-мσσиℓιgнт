I walked along behind Hak, Yun, Gija, Jeaha, Zeno, and of course, Yona. We we're on the way to a place where we could rest. Yona looked towards a little lake that was on our right, "Hey, can I go put my feet in the water, Hak?" Hak sighed, "Yes, Princess, we'll go with you." Yona looked dissapointed, "I want to go alone." Hak shook his head, "Just take one person with you, the rest of us will rest here." Yona looked at all of us, dang, I wish she would pick me. "Sinha, you can come with me." Hak, Gija, and Jeaha all laughed, "You would pick him over us?" Jeaha mocked, "He's too shy and weak. Why don't you take me, princess? I can show you how to swim." Hak's face went stern, "No, Jeaha, in this case i'm a little glad she chose Sinha." I felt a little hurt, I never knew that Jeaha thought I was weak. Yona grabbed my hand, excited, and pulled me along to the lake. "Hurry Sinha! It won't be long before Hak makes me come back." I let her drag me along, and sat next to her at the edge of a rock. She looked at my mask, suspiciously. "I want to take that mask off, Sinha. Can I?" I looked down and whispered, "I don't want to hurt you." Without warning, she grabbed my mask off of my face. I was stunned, as she grabbed my face and looked me in the eyes. I gasped slightly, she didn't get hurt. "Yona..." "Sinha, you have beautiful eyes. I wish I could see them more often." And she kissed me, on the lips. My heart skipped a beat, in shock, but returned her kiss. Our eyes met and locked, as she wrapped her arms around my neck. I pulled back, but leaving her arms around me, "What if Hak catches us?" "I don't care about Hak. Sinah, I love you." This was my chance, to tell Yona how I felt about her. Words could barely form in my mind, but I dragged her to my chest and whispered, "I love you too, Yona."
