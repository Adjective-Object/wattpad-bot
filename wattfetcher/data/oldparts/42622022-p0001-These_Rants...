Why do people wear such expensive things like Under Armour, The North Face, and crap like that when you can be comfortable and look like a hobo?
Oh, wait...
Why is Trevor Moran so perfect?
Why is a circle round?

Do fish drink water? No, dey don't drink water. They've been drinking a watermelon.
Sorry......................I have a really short attention span.
STOP! WAIT A MINUTE!
Do you like Fall Out Boy?
Cause I do.
If you don't....
Then why are you here?
I dress like a homeless person sometimes.
Sometimes I dance in public.
I like to embarrass the shit out of everyone I hang out with.
I guess that's why my imaginary friends don't invite me to go anywhere with them.
My only true friends are MittensForTheKittens and um...that's it...uh...
Yeah.
I love Lynn like a sister.
I love her cause she's amazing.
Love you b√¶.
I have no life.
I sleep with my pillow pet.
WOAH
THAT JUST GOT PERSONAL!
I just opened up to you!
You should be proud of yourself!
Wow...I really need to stay on track.
And stay away from the sugar.
Wow, it's pretty outside.
Am I the only one who automatically inhales the wind when I walk outside?
Yeah, I am.
I'll go now.
