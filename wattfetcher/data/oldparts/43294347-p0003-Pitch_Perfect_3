I should probably try to be her friend before she learns of my Hello Kitty problem.
"I haven't seen you around here before. Are you new?" I ask her kindly.
"Yes." She says, brushing a strand of hair out of her eyes.
I wait for her to continue, but she doesn't say anything else.
"Uh.. What's your name?" I prompt.
"Emmie....."
Again, I wait, but nothing.
Maybe she's already heard about Hello Kitty. I turn back to the front of the room. Mrs. Evans has just walked in, and my first class of eighth grade begins.
