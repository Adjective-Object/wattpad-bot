"Ok so make sure you finish up your French pro-" The teacher's words were interrupted by the sound of the bell ringing, signaling the start of 'A' lunch. Students grabbed their lunches and scattered out the door in a hurry, high school students are always hungry at this time of day.
I walked alongside other students through the halls, greeting friends and stopping at my locker, and grabbed my economics textbook. Today I wasn't going to be eating my lunch. I needed to be studying for my final test in my least favorite class.
