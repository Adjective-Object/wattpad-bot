I hate the thing called hate!
It gets us no where!
Why hate when you can love?
Yes, why can't we all just love?
Balance, of course,
Even though it's not the greatest balance,
For it could destroy us!
Yes, balance is keen, though,
Keen, indeed,
It'll bid us apart or bring us together!
Either we change our ways or bring upon the destruction of this planet!
We may have survived this long,
But evolution has caused yet more narcissism and less empathy in the young!
I can see it,
I've read it!
This is our chance!
Why not take it?
We shall take it, man!
Oh, yes, we shall!
This is our call to arms,
Our wake up call,
Did you hear me?
Wake up!
Oh, wake up!
Can't you see it?
I ask you,
Join us!
We'll start a revolution!
Oh, we'll start a revolution!
Now is our time to raise our guns!
Come on, my brothers,
And take a stand with me!
For we shall fight for our revolution,
With open minds and open hearts!
This is who we are,
So stand up and fight!
We ain't gonna let no one bring us down!
No, the future is in our hands!
Fight with us!
The world, it can be such a loving place,
Why can't we all die of natural causes?
There ain't gotta be bloodshed!
No, more we cry!
No more, no, no, no, no!
