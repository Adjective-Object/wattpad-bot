Today I turned 1,000. My mother has finally let me out of the house.Note: my house is a cave in the middle of Earth(a.k.a my mother). My name is Rose. My mother is Gaea and my father was a mortal that my mother had a summer fling with. I lived with my father for 10 years then it became clear that I was very different from than anyone else. So, my mother took me and raised me until now. Since my mother has things to do, I don't see her often. Our last conversation in the past 100 years was this morning and this is how it went
Gaea-"My daughter you are now 1000 years old."
Me-"Yes ma'am."
G-"So I have decided that you are you too old to be depending on me for everything and you are no longer welcome in this house. Pack your things and go to the surface. Make sure you don't come back."
Me-"Yay I get to go to the surface! Wait...are you kicking me out?"
G-..................
Me-"Mom?"
G-................
Me-"Great."-_-
