I slammed my brightly-painted door, silently cursing and ignoring my mother's words. I hear her screaming at Alex too, but she clearly knows he's not listening either. She wants to take us to a campsite this summer. It would be perfect if only I wasn't going on a road trip with my best friend Cody and Alex planning on flying to Paris to scope out his new College that he'll be attending this fall. As I flop onto my bed, I hear her stomping downstairs. Probably to talk to my dad. It's not like he's going to do anything. Alcohol took over his system years ago. The most he'll do to "help the situation" is yell at us and most likely result to a smack from the hand. I don't know why she's stays with them.**********************************************My mother is furious with us. She did not speak to me until an hour ago, when she said 'Good night'. Whatever. I sigh and pull out my notebook and start to write a new horror story. This ones about a clown and some terrifying dreams. I shudder and look around. I quickly drop my things and run into Alex's room. I sigh. He's working. I hug him from behind and then back away. He looks over at me and smiles. He then gives me a look that I'm guessing means "Go to sleep". I'm only a year younger... It's not like I'm a baby. Not like Annaliese was... Annaliese. I blink back tears and walk back to my room and jump into my bed. I rest my head on the slightly chilly pillow and curl up in my comforter. I start to think about the summer until exhaustion takes over.
