I never really meant for things to happen this way. I was just trying to make the mental pain go away. I never meant to become, well, addicted to the physical pain. I never meant for the thoughts to get worse. I sure as Hell never meant for anyone to find out. I never wanted to end up in therapy.
But then I met Ashton. He became my main priority. He was the only one I cared for. Months at a time I was clean. A meal at a time I began eating. Day after day I fell for him more. Until Luke decided that he likes me too and ruined it all. Telling me I was worth a lot more than Ash could show me. Telling me he needed me and I needed him far more than Ashton needed me or I needed Ashton. I didn't know who to choose. I guess I never will.
