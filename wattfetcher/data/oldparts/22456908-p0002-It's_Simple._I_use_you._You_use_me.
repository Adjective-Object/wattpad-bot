I stared at the tall figure. He looked familiar. Ive seen him somehwere..where have i?...Its Ethan.
He jumped on the robber and punched him. He then took his knife and punched the robber's face
one more time.
"Next time, why dont you try to not be such a wimp?" With that, the robber ran away with blood
dripping down his face. Ethan took the knife and threw it inside a trash can. He then looked back at
me.
"Are you okay?" He asked me. I just stared at him, with my hands shaking
"Hey! I said are you okay?" Realizing i was staring, i nodded my head at his question.
"Thats good!" he replied as he smiled his gorgeous smile that all the girls at my school drooled over. "Why are you walking alone in the dark? Do you need a ride home?"
I just nodded my head no. I just kept staring at him. Ethan had saved me. The most popular boy at
school. The boy who was the topic of every girl's conversation everyday. He saved me.
"Hey!" I heard him say. I came back to reality.
"Huh?"
"I said i can give you a ride home? Where do you live?"
Ethan wants to give me a ride? Ethan, THE Ethan. :O
"No...im okay. Th-th-anks for helping me" I took another glance at him and started walking until he pulled my arm.
"To be honest, i dont want to be a witness of a dead girl! So how about you let me give you ride?" He gave me a softsmile. I complied and got in his car.
As he drove me home, i kept playing with my hands. They were still shaking. I cant tell if it's
because i was almost killed or because im right next to Ethan.
"So.." I looked up to see Â him staring at me.
"What's your name?" He didnt know who I was. I sadly looked at him. I mean why would he anyway?
He's Ethan Collins. And, im only Lucille James. Besides the fact that we had 1st and 4th period
together, why would he need to know me.
"You look familiar. Do you happen to go to Norwalk?"
I nodded.
"Wow, dont you talk? Are you mute? " He chuckled. Good thing we reached my house before i could
respond. "Is this it?" I nodded and got out of the car.
Before i closed the door, i said, "It's Lucille". He looked confused. "My name. Thanks again! See
you in 1st period tomorrow" I gave a short smile and closed the door. He then drove off.
What a Crazy night.
