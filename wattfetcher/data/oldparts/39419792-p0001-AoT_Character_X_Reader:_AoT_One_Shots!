I am going to be doing AoT Character X Reader stories. I love suggestions! Feel free to give me some. This is my first time writing in this point of view, so please don't get mad if they suck. I'm use to writing in past tense so correct my mistakes. (I'm doing this when I should be typing up my other fanfic.) Whoops. h/c= hair colorf/v= favorite colorf/n= first namel/n= last namee/c= eye colors/c= skin colorAny other codes like the ones above that I'm missing?? If so let me know!! :) Thank you so much!!!!
