I gladly putted my Palm on his and walked beside him followed by Charlene holding his hand.

This warm feeling was delightful maybe they weren't cannibals or kidnappers.

I glanced at the couple who were staring into each others eyes smiling softly at eachother while Charlene nuzzled her head on his shoulders.

They looked so happy being together I wonder if I would somehow find happiness and love like that one day.

Someday.
