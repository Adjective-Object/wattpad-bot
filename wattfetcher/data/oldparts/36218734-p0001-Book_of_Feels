Turns out I have a family. It happened too fast.
So I was hugging my crush and EVERYONE thinks we're dating, but we're not. But I was hugging him and he was hugging me. Then one of my friends said, "I'm going to start calling you guys Mom and Dad." Thankfully, he didn't hear her. So at lunch, I told one of my friends and she was confused I told her all about it and she's like, "Nu-uh. You're mine. I'm going to be the other mom." During 6th period, I told him and explained it. His reaction was priceless. He said, "I don't remember doing it with you." I was going to tell him it was adoption, but I just stayed silent. After school, I went up to his locker and he said weirdly, "You left me for her?!? I was confused until I got it.
So yeah. So I have a kid, and ex-somewhat-husband, and a lesbian wife. Yay!!! Weird friends!!!
(Don't take offense of the lesbian part. We promise we weren't being disrespectful.)
Since that happened...I guess my family is open to anyone. WHO WANTS TO JOIN?!? XD
