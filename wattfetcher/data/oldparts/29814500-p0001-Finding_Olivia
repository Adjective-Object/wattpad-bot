"This is impossible!" I screamed as we searched through the woods to find the stone.
It had been 2 weeks since we figured out that out powers switched.
"It was the stone. I know it was." Tristan said looking behind a bush.
"This is where Clary and I were fighting. Its not here."
"Clary. Liv. Do you remember anything from that fight."
We thought for a moment.
"Well all I really remember is that we.."
I widened my eyes. "The stone!" I screeched.
"What about it?"
"It flew over to the middle of us and exploded making us fall backwards and making Clary have the moment of death." I said.
"So you're saying that the stone is gone?" Tristan asked.
I nodded my head.
"Well how are your powers ever going to switch back?" He asked.
"I don't know. You and Sky are the geniuses. Figure something out."
We all walked back inside.
"Ok girls. We got nothing." Sky started saying. "So instead we are going to start training but with each others powers..." She paused. "Have fun."
A few minutes after everyone was fighting.
"You're doing this wrong." Clary said.
"You are too." I said. "No. You have to do this to turn invisible." I showed her how.
"I'm doing this just fine."
"No you aren't."
"Shut the fuck up!" Tristan screamed.
"Hey. No. Let them settle this on their own. They have to learn. We can't baby them for long." Sky said.
"So you're taking their side?" Tristan spat.
"Since when were we taking sides?" Sky asked.
They started to bicker.
None of us did anything.
After a few minutes they were still arguing, we walked away from them.
We ran into Riley on the way to the kitchen.
"Clary." She mumbled stuffing her mouth with food. "Go help Shawn and Ryan with the food."
"Ok." Clary said.
Clary walked out and took Dylan with her.
"Wanna watch t.v?" I asked Riley.
"Yes. Of course." She said and we started laughing.
About 10 minutes later everybody was back in the house and there was food on the counter.
I felt my hands start to warm up and I was getting hotter by the minute.
I needed air.
I ran outside with Riley shouting after me.
