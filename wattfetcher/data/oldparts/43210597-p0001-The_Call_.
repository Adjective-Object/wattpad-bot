Private number.
"Is this Amanda Brews?" a lady asked through the phone.
"Yes,who is this?", I answered curiously.
"This is Agent B from the Black Op,meet me in the library near your house at 3. Do not speak to anybody." she ordered strictly. Before I could ask any questions , she hung up her phone. My eyebrows furrowed in puzzlement as I try to think through what just happened. "Did she just say she's from the black op?" I whispered to myself. "And how did she know where I live?" . My mind was surrounded by questions after questions.
The time now was 2 in the afternoon. I have 1 hour to think about going to the library to meet 'Agent B'. Suddenly , a thought came to my mind. "Becca! Ofcourse! This must be a prank," I spoke out loud, "Becca,you're so dead!" . Becca,one of my close friend, was also known as a huge prankster in my school. It was not a suprise if this was a prank by her. She was not one who would ask to meet up like a normal person. I told my aunt I was heading out to meet Becca. Apparently, my aunt is my only family. My parents went missing a few years ago one day. Ever since then, my aunt took good care of me.
-----------------------------------------------
Exactly at 3pm , I took a step into the library which was just 2 bus stops away from my house. I head to the cafe at the corner of the library and ordered a double chocolate. The cafe was not crowded nor was it empty. I examined the library for Becca aka 'Agent B' . A group of students was studying at a table for 4 quietly . At the other table there was a woman tutoring a child. Becca was nowhere in sight. I patiently sat at a table for 2 while taking small sips from my drink.Half an hour later, I got pissed off waiting and decided to dial Becca. Just as I took out my iPhone 5 , a red-haired woman wearing black leather jacket and high heel boots marched into the cafe. She was obviously not there for a drink nor to borrow a book. Her chestnut eyes took a quick scan of the cafe. As soon as her eyes met mine, she put a slight smirk on her face. I akwardly curved my mouth into a smile in respond to her smirk. She seemed as if she know me for a long time. I fidgeted as her eyes continued to stare at me. "If this was part of the prank, im so killing u Becca" i whispered to myself.
After what seemed like an eternity, she finally strolled to the counter to order a drink. It was ready in a minute.With her mocha, she walked towards me. "This is not getting any better," I thought to myself. As she got closer, I saw a letter B printed on the left top of her jacket. I was stunned for a moment. I was not feeling at ease. When she reached at my table, she grabbed the empty chair and asked "May I?" . Ofcourse it would be rude to say no so I just reluctantly nodded my head. She made herself comfortable before saying another word. Carefully, she put her mocha on top of the table. She was wearing a red lipstick which made her face looked much more fiercer. She looked like she was at her mid-twenties . She must have seen how lost i am and began introducing herself.
"My name is Beth , I called you just now. Sorry to disturb you out of a sudden but it's important." , her voice was stern. Agent Beth? Becca would never take a prank too far. "What's important?" , my voice was shaky. "Let's go somewhere private." Beth suggested. ______________________________________Im sorry if this chapter is boring and it's too short .
