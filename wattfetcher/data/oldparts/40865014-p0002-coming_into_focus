"Ciao Kat!"

At the end of a completely uneventful day I was packing up my stuff when Oren Pedes and his strange but somehow popular crew of delinquents came stalking by. I really didn't hear much, nor did I care, what they were saying but because of the hushed, soothing tone they were talking in, they seemed to be trying, unsuccessfully, to comfort who I think was Ivan Greene. It is not an uncommon sight anymore. People crying about loved ones. It used to be that everyone would cry but now the girls just act dead on the outside because they know as that fate has they will be next.
I have sympathy, really I do, but when it comes to this, all of us girls just keep quiet unless it was our best friend or something. Oren is a really nice guy and I feel bad for him. His girlfriend was really lucky to have him. I had heard from Kat (the gossip queen) that because she had been living with her single mother, that when her mom died Oren took her in.
Maybe I need to explain some more. Some sort of mutated something is killing off girls! Mothers, grandmas, children, daughters, even babies! No one knows why, you sort of just get sick and then you become delirious, and then you die! That is how my mother died, and how, most likely, I will die,
