I burst threw his door without knocking. "Ew, my eyes, oh god." I ran out and slammed the door. My brother and Arden, his girlfriend, was in there doing things that involved being naked.
I ran straight into a hard chest. I looked up and pulled away. I ran smack into the One and only Isaac Stone. "Mate." he said, eyes turning darker and wrapping his arm around my waist.
"What?" I asked trying the pry his arms off me. "I'm not your friend, now get off me."
His eyes turned even darker if that's possible. "Mine."
"Get away from me Isaac. I'm Not yours you crazy freak."
He pushed my back against the wall and whispered in my ear. "You're mine."
"I-I'm not yours. Back off freak." I tried pushing him off but he didn't budge.
He started kissing up My gaw and I tried squirming away. "Let me go Isaac. I'm not yours. I don't like you and you can't make me."
"I can't?" he asked pulling away. "You can't." I nodded.
"We'll see about that." he said before disappearing into the crowd.
What a freak.
