So now I'm at home watching more Gossip Girl, lying on my bed dreaming about Nathan. I mean seriously, what is wrong with me, he will almost definitely be in the popular group at school by his first day and I am just me a boring, ugly nerd.
After a few more episodes I go downstairs to get some pizza and ice cream. And guess who was sitting at the island eating my Ben and Jerry's. Yep you guessed it, it was Nathan. Well the best way to get on my bad side is definitely to eat my ice cream. I mean who does he think he is he may look like a frickin sex god but he just moved here and he is acting like he owns the place.
"Why are you at my house and why are you eating my ice cream?" I shout at him. I am so mad right now I don't care how hot he is, he is a really annoying.
"Oh your mom invited us round and said I could help myself to some food " Oh my god.
I can't deal I let out a loud grunt and make my way up to my room to watch more Gossip Girl. Yep that's the story of my life ice cream, Gossip Girl and pizza. Wow I have an amazing life.
So I fall asleep thinking about the hot, annoying boy next door.
