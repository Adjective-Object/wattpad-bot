This is where I will put my dreams, (If I can remember them, cuz my memory is TERRIBLE)  so I will scribble them down in a book beside my bed of a morning, then when I have time copy em into here! I'm doing this journal so I can get in touch with my dreams, so I can become lucid, my goal is every night. If you don't know what lucid dreaming is, stop reading, and look it up RIGHT NOW.
