Shawn Mendes is a simple, caring, lovable kid.When his music career takes off after school ends, and he plays all Summer, how will it effect his grades after Summer is over? How will he play concerts for his fans? Maybe one thing will be good in school...

"Hey, Flynn." I say, answering my phone, as my friend Flynn calls me on FaceTime.
"Heyo Shawn!" Flynn shouts back, "Shh, my mums asleep." I shush him, "Oh, okay..." He replies, quietly.
"So I heard you're Summers over." Flynn tells me, and I nod, slowly.
"I wish it wasn't. I already know what Cameron's grades looked like when he went back to school last year." I state, and Flynn nods, "He could make a song out of it." I say, and we both laugh. "Yeah. He really could..." Flynn says, and we continue laughing.
"I heard there's a new girl in town, Shawneee!" He says, excitement in his voice.
