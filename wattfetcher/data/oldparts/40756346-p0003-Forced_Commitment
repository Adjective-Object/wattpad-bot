"I'd fuçk you right here if I could get away with it." He groaned. As he stepped forward I felt his erection strain against his suit trousers.
"What?" He frowned seeing my distressed expression.
"I'm a virgin." I blurted.
He took a moment to recover. If I wasn't assessing every inch of his face I wouldn't have seen the slight widening of his eyes.
"I don't want to lose my virginity to a man I met this morning, a man I know nothing about other than his..his reputation."
"Are you denying me what is mine?" He seethed, his anger clearly visible.
"No, I'm just not ready." He nodded almost reluctantly.
"Your virginity is safe for tonight Mrs Armel but mark my words, when I do take you, I'll fuçk you hard. I'll mark you as mine so that you will never think of another man. I'll be all you need, all you can think of. Besides just because I'm not inside you tonight doesn't mean we can't do...other things." He smirked.
My breathing was shallow, my legs like jelly. "Thank you." I mumbled in a whisper. If his words alone could turn me into a puddle of need I had no chance.
"Come."
I followed Lyle out to the ballroom our hands holding onto each other. He smiled down at me as we walked to our seats so we could rejoin his mother.
My heart was running its own marathon in my chest as he spoke confidently to his family around him. I didn't know how I was going to survive this marriage. I had to get out as soon as I could, hopefully before he found out that I had lied about my virginity.
At least I had given myself something that was going to be crucial - time.
