Hi I'm lilly I was a orphan at Max's Orphanage, just so you know I lived a HORRIBLE life...
-I never knew my real parents or family
-I had a VERY STUPID  caretaker
-and I don't have any friends
But...that ALLL changed on adoption day aka my birthday YES IT WAS ON MY BIRTHDAY and that gave me a sighn.A sign saying MAYBE the world gave me enough trouble .....or so I thought....
Let's begin...
The story of my life...
