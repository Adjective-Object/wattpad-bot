"Cal!" I started to run after him, but then stopped from another dizzy spell. My eyesight was starting to get hazy, and I couldn't keep my balance.
"Aria!" I heard Ashton yell. I started to fall, and I couldn't grab on to anything to stay up. I saw Calum run towards me before I blacked out.
That day they told me it was just stress, and lack of eating. They were wrong. My name is Aria Bethany Hood and I need a heart transplant. I don't remember if it was because my heart's too big, or too small, either way I am going to die.
Yes, there is a possibility that I could get the transplant, but there's a list, a huge list of people that have the same problem I do. Due to my shit choices with alcohol I'm near the bottom of that list.
