------skip rest of school------
When I got home after school I took my phone out of my pocket and I had a message from Michael.
Michael:"Hey babe, what you up to later"
OMG he keeps calling me babe not that I don't like it or anything I love it when he calls me that.
I text back saying "Nothing, why"
Michael:"Because I'm going to the movies I will be at your house at 8. see you later babe"
Me:"See you then"
OMG IM GOING TO THE MOVIES WITH MICHAEL AHHHH
what do I wear ,what do I do ,omg I don't want to muck this up.
