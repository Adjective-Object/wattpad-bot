Had I known what would happen, I wouldn't have gone. I would've stayed home and watched a movie or done something normal maybe even picked up my room. But for some reason the universe decided that it hated me a long time ago and just had to make my life as complicated as possible.

AN: Dedicated to all my friends who have been on this ride with me from the start, not necessarily writing but just supporting and helping this story grow! You know who you guys are :)
Hope you all enjoyed!
