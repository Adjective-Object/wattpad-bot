He kissed me again and I started to undo his shirt. When I managed to take his shirt off revealing his perfectly tanned abs, he was undoing mine.
When he was in the last button, the doorbell rang and I groaned.
Spain laughed and whispered in my ear,"We continue tonight~"
I smiled and kissed him once more before heading to the door and putting on my shirt.
"If it's the potato bastard their will be he-"
"Fratello can we talk. Alone?" Italy said.
I looked at Italy and sighed. She better have a good reason to have stopped me and Spain.
Nodding, I let Italy to my room and closed the door behind us.
"So what do you wan-"
"I can't keep the secret anymore. I'm going to tell everyone on the next World meeting." She said dropping her male voice.
I gagged."Feli why?!"
"I can't keep the secret-"I covered her mouth and said,"Speak in italian."(When I write words in bolds it means italian)
She nodded."I can't keep the secret any longer. I know you promised Grandpa Rome, but this is my decision."
"Sorella I didn't just promise Grandpa Rome. It was his Death Wish for gods sake!""But-""No Feli! You can't and you won't!"
Feli's eyes were red and streaks of tears ran down her cheeks.
She nodded and got up."Alright. Buonanotte Fratellone."
"Buonanotte Sorellina."
She left my room and slammed the door behind her as she left the house.
I took a deep breath and laid on the bed holding my head.
Spain looked into my room and stared at me with a smile.
"What do you want Tomato bastar-"
His lips met mine and kissed me passionatly. Once we pulled away to breath he said,"You looked stressed Roma. Were where we?"
I smiled and kissed him again."Here."
I turned over and was on top of him. I took off his shirt and said,"You know Spain, those jeans do look a bit tight."
"Yep. Wanna help take them off~?"
I smiled."Why not?"
