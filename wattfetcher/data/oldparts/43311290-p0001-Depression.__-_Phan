*Phils POV*
It was the first day of a new school year and I was not excited. Okay, most kids aren't thrilled about going back to school, but they sure did want to go see their friends again. As for I, Well, I don't have any.
I sighed and got dressed, then stumbled downstairs, hoping not to see my family awake, But, they were.
"Morning!" My little sister Kate said with a lot of enthusiasm. I ignored her and grabbed a bowl for cereal as she frowned.
"That wasn't very nice, Philip." My Father said, not seeming to happy. I came out to my parents last weekend.. My mum was perfectly okay with it, but my dad on the other hand was not. He seemed so disappointed in me...
I sighed again and put the bowl down.
"I'm not in the mood right now to talk." I mumbled to them and walked out of the door.
As I walked I noticed Dan. Dan is the person that has bullied me ever since i came out to my 'friends', they told everyone and left me for the popular kids. Which is why I spent so long deciding whether to tell my parents or not.
"Well well well, look who it is." He said, walking towards me.
His voice sends shivers down my spine, and when he approaches me its like a vampire piercing his fangs into my neck and I'm unable to move.
"Go away." I said cold, regretting it a little when he gets closer.
"Awh, Little Philly thinks he runs the show around here? He thought wrong." He said, pushing me the slightest bit, enough to make me drop my books.
"Can you not!" I yelled, starting to get frustrated as my breathing started to increase.
"Shut up." He said harshly.
I looked down, ignoring him and grabbed my books then tried to walk away, but he grabbed my arm.
"Why in such a rush?" He smirked as I got shakier.
"I d-don't want to be late." I stuttered.
"You won't be, don't worry." He gave a devilish smile and moved the hair out of my face.
I swallowed air in fear as his face got closer to mine.
He slowly leaned in and kissed me. I froze in fear as my cheeks turned pink red. He KISSED me.
