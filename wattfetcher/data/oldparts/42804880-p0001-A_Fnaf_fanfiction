Chapter OneI heard a thud and stumbled towards the door, I bent down and picked up the paper which had just fallen through my letter box, I stumbled back to the kitchen and played the paper out on the table. I skimmed through each story before my eyes stopped, right before me was an advert for a night guard job, I noted down the number since I needed a job and immediately rung it, I was greeted by the voice of a man...Scott (The Boss): "Hello? This is Fazbears entertainment."I took a deep breath before speaking. "I rung up about the night job for the local pizzeria near Oklahoma." I tried my best to sound cheery."Okay...uh what's your name?"I took another breath feeling quite awkward. "My name is Jenna, Sir" I heard his chuckle on the other side of the phone. "Please call me Scott and you start tonight, your uniform will be given to you by the janitor and make sure you are here by 11:45 to check the building of any people, if by any chance there is anyone make sure they are out by 12:00." Before I could say anything else he hung up, I put my house phone down and sighed. I still had a full day to so whatever I wanted, this sucked really since I didn't really have friends... ((Sorry this chapter is short, I promise the next one will be way longer! Also dont forget to comment, heart and favorite the shits....this is my first Fnaf fanfiction so Er...it might be a little bad. By the way the animatronics in this story are the human versions))
