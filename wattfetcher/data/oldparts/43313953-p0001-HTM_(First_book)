This story is obviously based on HTM because of the title. I'll try my best to go along with most of the plot to HTM from their episodes. I mostly watched Pete's perspective, but I did watch others from time to time. (As in like the competitions, Lachlan's assassinations, first and final episodes, ect.)
I hope you all are as hyped as I am!
