" Im suppose to be working here for someone to there makeup and would you know whi that person is?" She asked honestly. Michael then said "What if I told you I am that person?"
He said with an unread smirk.

Michaels P.O.V: This women is absolutely Gorgeouse, stunning,Beautiful, the way her long hair flows, that red silk long sleeve and those jeans hunging her carves in all the right places.
She then said

"Well i would say you have perfect frame and I already know what tones to use on your face so his should be easy." Wow I thought
"Please sit down." I said in a nervouse  voice but thank god ahe didnt notice. As we began to talk money and everything I told her she WILL have to tour with me stay with me, she sighned the contract, and I still explained her things ect.
She seemed amused with the idea when I explanned and told her who I really was to other people. "Well, today was just a 'get to know ya kind of thing'." I said with a cheeky smile. She nodded and I walked her to the door and saw her get in her car and drive away.
To be Continued.... Hope you enjoyed part 1 as much As i did creating it! And the very first P.O.V is Michaels! Comment,Vote, and Share!
