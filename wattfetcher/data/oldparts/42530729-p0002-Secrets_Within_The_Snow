Over at Savannah's house... (Savannah's POV)

Me, Jade, and Olivia shove through the front door and into my house."Mom I'm home!" I call loudly, hoping she could hear me. "Hello sweety" she cooes as she walks in from the kitchen. At the sight of Olivia and Jade, a delighted smile spreads across her face. "Hey girls!" she greets them. I smack myself in the face. Mom do you always have to make me embarrassed?"  For some reason, my mom always gets really happy when I have friends over. It's honestly just part of her nature. She never means to do anything wrong but sometimes it just- happens. "Savannah did you have fun?" she askes me. I shrug. "As much as school can be". I mumble, annoyed. If she saw I was annoyed, she definitely showed no clue of it. She carried on talking about how nice the school looks and how the name of it was so ironic because the last month or so had been clear, sunny skies. At this point I wanted to scream. I try to end the conversation without hurting her feelings. " Mom I gotta um.. go to do uh.." Jade backs me up. "She, I mean we have to go do homework." I cross my fingers and hope Mom's convinced as Jade cracks a pleading smile. "Very well" she says. "Go do your homework but make sure you don't copy each other and ask me for help if you need it" Me and the girls said goodbye to Mom and walk towards my room. "Savannah!" Mom whispers before I get far. I gesture her to carry on. "I know I can sometimes be embarrassing" she starts. "But I want you to know that I never mean to" "It's okay" I forgive her. "I guess I was being a kind of impatient" I give her a big hug. She kisses me on the cheek. "Thanks for understanding" I tell her. "Go with your friends" she says. I thank her once more and trudge toward my room.
