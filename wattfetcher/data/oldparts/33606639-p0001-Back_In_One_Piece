I know you kill for me
You'll die for me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Ooh baby, I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat
I barely sleep
Aaliyah,
It was just the two of us in the studio, Timb and Missy had gone home and so had the rest of his crew. He and I both wanted to leave but we needed to finish the rest of our song because we were already behind schedule with the album.
The lights were dimmed very low just how I like it, as I stood behind the mic laying down a verse for the lead single on the album.
I know you kill for me
You'll die for me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Ooh baby, I can't help to think
I was half way into singing my part when I felt him behind me, He moved my hair from behind my back to the side and began trailing kisses up and down my neck and upper back that was visible due to that fact I had decided to wear a halter today. He held my waist as I turned my head to meet his.
He moved his head down and we began kissing he poked my tongue begging for entrance, I bit my lip and finally granted his wish. I know we shouldn't be doing stuff like this, it's supposed to be strictly business.
We continued kissing whilst he lifted my legs up and I wrapped them around his waste, he held me from my ass and swooped me over to the wall knocking over the music sign not breaking our kiss he shoved his hand up my blouse. His hand roamed freely around my chest as he reached behind my bra trying to unhook it. I pulled away from the kiss and unhooked it myself and threw it at the music stand.
He picked me up and gently put me on the stool behind the mic, I sat whilst he stood in between my legs pulling my blouse of me. Now I was topless whilst he was fully clothed, taking over I stood up and pulled his shirt over his head, My hands went lower and lower until I suddenly found myself unbuckling his pants. He stepped outta his pants and walked me into a wall, he towered over me as he picked me up again and started rubbing me through my pants, we started kissing but I moaned throughout the kiss causing him to smirk he pulled down my jeans and stuck his hand into my panties.
He stroked my pearl with his thumb softly before adding in a finger inside of me. "Mhmm" I moaned as he penetrated me with his fingers. My juices flowed soaking up my panties until he kindly removed them off me. I was soaking wet and he had barely done anything. I closed up my legs until he opened them back up.
"I ain' done yet babygirl." He smirked at me. My mouth went from an O to a scream when he plunged inside of me. He hadn't even moved but I could feel him in my stomach already.
"It's too big take some out.." I begged he smirked at me again but went in deeper, I was in pain but it was pleasurable pain.
He suddenly started thrusting slowly until he built up a quick pace, I moaned loudly although anyone could be at the studio I couldn't care less. He brought me out of the recording Booth into the sound area and plopped me onto the couch he lifted one of my legs over his shoulder and thrusted harder until I felt a tingly sensation inside of me.
"Mhm, Right there Baby!" I yelled in frustration as I was close to my climax. He turned me over leaned me against the soundboard he thrusted inside of me even harder this time showing no sign of stopping, I was just about to explode when I started squeezing his dick.
