I was about to happily take my first lick while quickly turning around, but that perfect addictive moment was ruined when all of a sudden a rainbow tie dye covered dude slammed into me, causing my freezing cold Ice cream to slam into my chest. My jacket became a sticky icky mess and surrounding families roared with laughter.
I'm pretty sure the hot steam coming out of my ears was melting the Icecream, creating a large puddle on the floor, this was a pretty depressing scene and I wish I would disappear out of thin air like this day was just one big nightmare.
"I'm SO sorry man! Hey, uh, are you okay lady?" I heard the guy say in a goofy accent.
I guess I was still in shock because him and Liv had to snap me out of it by flicking me or repetitively snapping their fingers in sync in front of my dazed face. I shook my head and looked up at his deep brown orbs, now I know why he puts girls in delirious trances, they weren't too bad looking. Not angel eyes but not the devil eyes either, y'know?
What the hell am I saying?! He ruined my perfect delicious masterpiece and spilled it all over me like it was no big deal! Sure, like I actually enjoying being a human target for foolish strangers to throw arctic cold treats at me, oh hell to the fucking no. I was about to bitch slap the stupid out of him but Liv was having an outrageous, crazy anxiety freak out attack. She was stuttering like a mad women and I think she was almost sweating like a pig?
"Oh my gosh you're- you're-"
CLIFFHANGER MY BEAUTIFUL AND STUNNING BEYOTCHES! XD although I'm pretty sure you know who it is since y'all are extremely smart ;)
Phew I thought this chapter was sort of long (probably wasn't) it just took so much time to come up with some creativity and humor to make it fun. It's pretty dang random in my personal opinion.. buut I wanted to make it sort of different then the other amazing fan fictions 😊😆
It's about to get crazy on this roller coaster so strap yourselves in for some strange excitement that will blow your minds!
Next chapter should be up in a few days 👏👏👏 (thank The Lord and the government for giving us thanksgiving break can I get a hallelujah!?)
Love you my amazing koala bears 🐨
