This time around, there is no big announcement in Capitol square - no thousands of reporters, waiting upon Vienna's every word. There is nobody but for one reporter, sent straight from Capitolis magazine, the most popular magazine in the Capitol, Attina and Cicero. This time, though Vienna holds the card on which the twist is reading, she is not the one reading it - she is far too ttired for that. Instead, it is Cicero who is announcing the twist of this Quell to the world.
"In honour of the 350th Hunger Games, as a reminder of the Capitol's generosity when the districts surrendered, each tribute is to write down their biggest wish. If they win, it will be granted. We hope that this will encourage your participation."
The next day, thousands of people walk down the Capitol streets a magazine in hand, and just as many families in the districts are huddled in front of the television, having just learned the news of what is awaiting them. Some seem incredulous, and after what the last Quell had in store for them, it is not hard to understand why. To some, it seems almost impossible to fathom that this could go well for them - or, as well as this can go, anyway. There is almost excitement as people whisper to each other the typical phrase, as mocking as ever.
May the odds be ever in their favour.
