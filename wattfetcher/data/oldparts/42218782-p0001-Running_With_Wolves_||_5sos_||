Hello people! So I've started this new book Running With Wolves! I've always been into the whole supernatural stuff so I've decided to write about it.
Yes of course 5 seconds of summer will be playing the main characters also.
There will be more supernatural beings in this story, not just Werewolves so beware of that.
This story is full of twists and I have a lot planned so beware.
I hope you enjoy this story!
Love you guys!
