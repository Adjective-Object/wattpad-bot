"Kaylee get up and get ready to school" mom shouted.
"First day of school, ew "i whispered
I got up and showered, brushed/dried my hair and then curled it cause why not üíÅ did some light eyeshadow then did my eyeliner/mascara.
"HURRY YOUR BUTT UP OR IM NOT GOING TO TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL KID" said her brother.
"IM COMING JOSH, CALM YO TITS" i yelled running down the stairs in black leggings, a lover not a fighter black and white crop, and red/white/black flannel around my waist, and red converse.
I grabbed my american flag backpack and headed off to school.
"If u have any problems at, school text me" said josh.
"Ok josh" I said rolling my eyes "I will" I said.
"Promise" he said looking me straight in the eyes.
"Yes I promise" I said hugging him and getting out of his truck.
"BYYYYEEEEEEE" he yelled in a typical white girl voice. I gave him the stop or I will murder you look and he just drove away.
*hayes POV*
"HEY BABE" I said as I ran up to my girlfriend Lexi
"Babe, don't wrinkle my shirt!" said Lexi and I was hugging her.
"oh...sorry" I said, looking down at the ground.
" you better be because this is 90% silk" Lexi said while rolling her eyes.
My friends were watching the hole thing and looked at me, I just shrugged not knowing what to say.
"HAYES, there is that one girl kaylee" said my friend Eli.
"Oh, that girl you have been crushing on" I said really loudly nudging him laughing. he just gave me a are you kidding me look.
"go talk to her man" I said pointing at her and she saw me, oops.
*kaylee POV*
I walked into school to see the most popular guy in school point at me, Hayes Freaking Grier. I dident know what to say so I just walked away.
"Hey" somebody said as I felt a pull on my arm. I turned a raining to see Eli, hayes's best friend.
"Um...hi?" I said nervously, this is the first time one of the cool kids ever talked to me other than Lexi making fun of the way I look or when she would call me a wanna be YouTube or something **(btw kaylee is a youtuber)**
"What's up?" said Eli.
"Um, just walking to class...I guess" I said.
"Oh, really let me see your schedule to see if we have any of the same classes" he said grabbing for my schedule in my hands.
"Okaaayyy?" I said nervously handing him my schedule.
"Hey! We have all the same classes except 2nd and 6th" he said excitedly handing back my schedule.
"Cool so does that mean you walking me to class?" I giggled a little and then the bell rang.
"Let's go then" he said laughing and grabbing my hand.
