"Kenna! Let's hurry to the after party!" Sophia yelled. We walked out of the awards and were greeted my paparazzi. I walked to the car waiting for us. Sophia told the driver where to and we were at the party in 20 minutes. We walked in the club and I saw Jimmy freakin Fallon. I hadn't seen him since last year. I ran over to him hugging him.
"Hey it's been forever!" I said.
"Kenna! Look this is David Beckham and his wife Victoria." He said waving his hands around the place.
"Wow so nice to meet you. I'm Kenna Brasfield." I stated shaking their hands.
"I saw you on that hilarious show. Um wasn't it Teachers. Yes, Teachers. I loved you and Christina Silvet as the 1st grade teachers." David said smiling big. I smiled back and thanked him. I found Sophia talking to someone and ordered drinks for us.
After more than 6 drinks I started to blank out until at the end of the night.
"Hello I'm Kenna, would you like a drink?" I slurred. I adjusted my black dress a little and looked back up at the man.
"Why not? I'm Harry." He said. I couldn't tell if he was British or not. Maybe it was because he was drunk or that I was drunk. Same difference.
I ordered a drink for him and we started to dance. An hour later we were getting in a taxicab. We arrived at his place and we started kissing. Then it lead to 2nd base then many other bases and we were in bed.
