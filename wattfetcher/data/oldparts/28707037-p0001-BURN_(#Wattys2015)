recreation's okay
if you don't overuse
it helps on days
full of constant abuse

it's not like I'm crazy
or criminally inclined
i just like to relax
i just like to unwind

too much to forgive
so much pain to forget
the world is in chaos
it helps ease my regret

don't worry about me
i got a lot on my mind
i just love to relax
just love to unwind

it's not going to kill me
there's no need to judge
i'm careful as can be
please don't hold a grudge

you say that's it's hurting you
you say "I'm not blind"
but I need to relax
i just need to unwind

what's the harm in a buzz?
it's better than nothing
"she does what she does"
we all want to feel something

maybe I should stop
they say you only have so much time
but I have to relax
have to unwind
