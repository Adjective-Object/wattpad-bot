Tobias's pov
I walk into Tris's hospital room. She is pale and hasn't waken up in 3 months. I know she won't wake up but i can't just let her go. I need her. I take a seat and just wait there. I need her to wake up..... please tris wake up for me... please.

The doctor walk in and asks to see me outside. I walk with him out. '' I'm very sorry  Mr.Eaton" says the doctor. He looks very said. '' sir I got the blood work back and congradulation'' he say. '' what'' I say confused. "your girlfriend is pregant'' he says ''OH MY GOSH'' I say. " ok i have bad news'' he says.  "what?'' i say. I am shaking i am terrified about what he gonna say. what if there is something wrong with the baby? What if the baby wont survive? What if worse? I am so happy that i will be a dad but i am said because the baby wont even have a mom. I don't need much but i need her. we are gonna be a family but without her."the fetus take nine months to live but your wife is already dying so that means if the baby wants to live then.... we have to take her out now'' he says.'' do it'' i say quietly and turn around and see her on her bed. "what was that'' he says. I turn around and a yell"do it'' i scream. i walk into her room i am so sorry tris'' i grab her hand and kiss her forhead.
