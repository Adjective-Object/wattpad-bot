Hey guys! This is a new book that I've planned on writing after I'm done with slay.
Its basically about a teen who has autism (search it up if you dont know what it is) and suffers from major anxiety. She's an outcast called retarded and many nasty names for the way she was born. She thinks much different than normal people and views things from a whole new perspective.
She has suicidal thoughts sometimes but she never actually suicides.
Her mom and dad busy themselves in work so they dont have to think about their imperfect daughter.
She meets someone who really irritates her. Some Autistic people are sort of like neat freaks. So they have everything planned and when this person (im still choosing who will play his role but I know for sure someone in one direction), comes into her life he basically flips everything over for her.
In the midst of doctor appointments, anxiety attacks and depression, She finds herself changing. She finds herself doing things that she couldn't do before (no she didn't grow out of the disorder). She just learns to stretch it and adjust it a little for her (like talking more, writing stuff she already said down, and taking more risks).
(***confusing It'll start making sense later on.)
She finds herself falling for this cute annoying guy.
But the insecurities in her head only creates more drama than needed.
Would he want to be with a freak like her?
Follow the journey of this girl as she faces life head on and struggles with love and a mental disorder.
>>AGAIN ILL BE UPDATING THIS AFTER SLAY BUT IM JUST GETTING IT OUT THIRE SO YOU GUYS KNOW WHATS COMING UP.
