Dear Brett,
I really, really need your help. I found your ad in the paper (Who knew they even still made those!). I hope you don't mind I am sending you a letter instead of an email. My parents read my emails, and if they saw this- they would freak. I figured mail would be best.
Hi, my name is Casey. I go to a school for really smart kids- except for one problem. Half of us aren't smart. Crumberlin Private High School sure has everyone fooled.
I, unfortunately, am one of the ones who isn't smart. I fake my grades, cheat on worksheets, and you get the point right?
I really need some help out in the real world. I don't want to be like this forever. I mean, it has come to the point where someone has made up a fake report card and we can type in what we would like our grades to be and bam-you are smart!
If you agree, I will pay you $1,000 in cash. Please mail me back at this address. Just don't make the envelope all noticeable so my parents aren't tempted to look inside.
Sincerely,
Casey Carson
