Warning it has cutting scene and depression stuff but Alexis will try to stop that
Zaks pov:I check my phone and look at my home screen it was a picture of my crush she was in my class I had a picture with her when we went on a field trip I made it my home screen.i put on a long sleeved shirt and blue jeans making sure it hid my cuts I quietly grab my backpack and head to the kitchen my mom was sleeping she gets drunk and tells me stuff about my child hood I was basically a mistake mom forgot to wear protection so I was made my dad broke up with her after and left us but I'm bullied to do I grabbed a lunch I made yesterday for myself and head to the bus I sat down and a bully came to me calling me a fag and when he almost was gonna punch me a hand punched the arm and then I heard a sweet but loud voice Leave him alone she said! Surprised I turn to see then a girl with a pink dress purple leggings pink socks and pink shoes with rosy red hair and emerald eyes with freckles pushed him she sat next to me putting her poker dot backpack on the ground she introduced her self hi I'm Alexis I'm really tuff so I can be your body guard she grinned she was jumping to stuff I just agreed she smiled and told me that we're best friends since she "saved my life" I sigh and agree I guess we have the same classes for everything I say as she shows me her schedule we exchanged phone numbers and got out of the bus
Alexis's pov: I think I like him when I seen him writing in math he had cuts on him arm I frown but keep writing the teachers just write on the board and make us copy it down.they don't do anything else they just go through there phones which was easy for us. But I see Zak look at a girl with blue hair a lot I wonder if he likes her I get that thought out of my head I don't think sad thoughts it makes me angry and sad and depressed.Lunch time..
Alexis pov: me and Zak sit down at a table for 2 at the cafeteria Zak don't mind me asking but do you self harm I say frowning while opening my bag of chips he looked surprised like if I said I did it and then he looked down and said yes.i looked at him well thankfully today's a Friday I said trying to Change the subject he laughed and said ya. So Zak do you fancy the blue haired girl in our class he blushed and nodded My heart broke but I'm not gonna let her win.I head into the girls bathroom and see my best friend Vicky I told her everything except for the part were he cuts she looks and me and tells me she has a plan she grabs my hand and takes me to the table hello Zak Vicky says I know your Alexis's friend and I want you to come to our grouping today games and food we will have me you Alexis and Dennie there.
