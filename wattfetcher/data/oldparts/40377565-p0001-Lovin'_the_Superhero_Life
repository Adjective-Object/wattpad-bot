It's been a year since it happened. the accident. I was caught up with how much I didn't have, but now I see what went wrong.
I started to hear conversations that weren't taking place around me. It could be silent in the room, and I could hear talking.
I went to my boyfriend John's house, and we completely zoned out for a while. but he was talking, and kinda loud. but then I realized nothing was coming out of his mouth.
"What are you talking about John? I wasn't listening for a second." "I wasn't talking about anything, but I am thinking about something." he said as just put his hand on mine. "I'm sure it's just lack of sleep. you do stay up all night sometimes." I stood up REAL SLOW while shaking my head and said "but I heard you talking" and John asked "when?". "Just then, a minute ago. I swear I did."
We sat in silence, and I droned over the facts of what had just happened. i turned to John, and he looked at me "what is it?" he asked. I said to him "I think I can read minds."
