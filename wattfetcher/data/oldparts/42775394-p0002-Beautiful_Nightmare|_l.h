All the guys looked away, "Ew. sorry to tell you this, but we ain't in a porn star show. Bye Felicia." I flip her off and turn around to the guys.
She shoved me, Ashton's eyes widen knowing that I'm about to rip this girls head off. "You have no idea who you're messing with, honey." I turn back to her.
I grab her neck and slammed her to the floor. I punch her in the face, already leaving her nose bloody. Ashton grabs my hands and pulls me up. "Relax. We can't reveal that we're werewolves." He whispers in my ear.
Katie starts coughing and holds on to her nose. "Bitch!" She yells out to me and runs to who knows where. Luke starts laughing, "Damn Klau. You sure do know how to fight."
"It's natural to me." I glance at Ashton, smiling.
"How old are you?" This pale guy with colored hair asked, "17. Let me tell you guys about myself. I'm Klaudia Ryann. I moved here without my parents, because I was having problems. My parents are the ones who told me to move, in LA. I used to live in Texas. I already knew Ashton when we were younger, grew up together. But he had to move here, for some reason. I love the color black and gold. My favorite animal are wolves and llamas. So that's pretty much it." I bit the inside of my cheek.
"Now, what about you guys? At least tell me you're names."
"I'm Michael."
"Calum."
"Harry."
"Niall."
