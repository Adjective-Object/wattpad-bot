"Emma! Will you get down already we are going to be late!" I heard Cameron calling from downstairs.   I grunted and opened the door of my room. Don't get me wrong, I usually am a nice, witty and positive person. I must say, I find myself very humorous, especially when I am arguing or discussing with people. But something happened back in my previous high school that made me realize I had to stay away from all the other students. I hate drama and high school is full of it. So I will try to be the most unpopular girl this year, besides how hard will it be. After all, we got transferred to Padua High School with my brother, or at least that's what I thought it will be, before my bad reputation, a relationship and HE came in the way. Â  I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Emma James, I am a senior student and my brother, Cameron James, is a year younger than me. Our father is in the U.S. Army, so I help my mother a lot in the house, when he is gone. They are really the best parents, in my opinion, somehow a bit hippie with the way they take care of us. Which I love, because I can speak freely with them. Funny how my dad is that way, I know, but being in the army and being a father are two different things and dad realizes it.    So shortly this is me and my life. Now let me tell you how everything went NOT according to my plan.
