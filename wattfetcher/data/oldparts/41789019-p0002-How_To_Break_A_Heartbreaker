A/N: So this is my first teen fiction story. I've done one fanfiction story that I just started. I like having a say in how the characters act and what not.
Criticism would be helpful, but I don't want any rude, disrespectful, etc. comments. Also, I'll say this now. This is my book and it'll go the way I've planned. Its just how this works.
Also, if you don't like who I've chosen to play my characters instead of complaining why not picture someone else you like in their place? I'd rather have that than comments on how ugly so and so are.
Anywasy enjoy!
