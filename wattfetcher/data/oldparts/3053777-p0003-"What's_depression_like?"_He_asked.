And the last thing I’m going to do is give them what they want.



What depression is like?



It’s horrible.

But it isn’t impossible to survive.

It isn’t impossible to make you stronger.

It isn’t impossible to see light, just for a moment.

It isn’t impossible to let someone in, as long as you try hard enough.

It isn’t impossible to forget, even if it’s just for a moment.

It isn’t impossible to defeat.



I might haven’t found the ways to do all of those things yet. But I have moments when I’m sure I will.

We all can.



And yes. I do have my problems. I am struggling.

But if you ever need to talk.

If you ever feel like you’re going to leave.

Talk to me.

Just for a moment.

Because I’ll try to make you believe you’re worth it.

Even when I don’t believe I am worth it.

Even when I want to leave.

Even when I feel just as down as you.

Even when I cry just as much as you do at that moment.

I will try to make you stay.

Because I know how you feel.
