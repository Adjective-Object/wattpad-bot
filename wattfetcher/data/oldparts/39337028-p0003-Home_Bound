"I am the cool one!" I protest. "Your mommy is the responsible one, remember?" I whine, jumping as the door to the B&B opened.
A young man walked in with a cello case on his back. He had two duffle bags in his hands. Blue jeans, white tshirt and very very handsome. His brown hair was tousled around.
"Is there a room available?" He breaths, staring at me. I run my hands on my tight red dress and clear my throat.
"Lemme see!" Mary smiles wide, opening the little book Ruby kept to keep track of the guests. The man chuckled and moved closer, setting his bags down.
"Thank you sweetheart." He winks and wipes his forehead. I smile weakly and walk out from behind the counter. My heels clicked on the wood flooring as my hips swayed with every step I took.
"Mary why don't you go find Ruby? She can-"
"Found one!" Mary squeals, pointing to the book. She loved to help out and found it especially fun here.
The man chuckles. "Can you put me down?" He asks. Mary looks up at me, making a face.
"Of course." I say weakly. The man smelled like leather, something I hadn't really thought of. His blue eyes stared intently at us, watching our every move.
I take the book in my hands and grab a pen. "Name?" I ask, raising an eyebrow.
"Robin Locksley." He chuckles.
"How long are you going to be here?" I ask again. Robin smiles wide and shifts under the weight of the instrument on his back.
"Wouldn't you like to know?" I glare up at him.
"Watch it." My eyes flick to Mary who was watching our encounter. "How long?" I press.
"I'm not sure. Can we do the payments weekly?" He asks, making me cough. No one ever stayed for weeks at a time.
"Sure." I nod, scribbling down all the information needed. "Mary, grab key 33 for me. Do you need help with anything?" I ask, reaching for a bag.
"No I'm alright. Wouldn't want you to carry anything." He winks and starts to move forwards.
"This way!" Mary giggles as she skips down the hallway. Mary stops in front of the room. "Granny!" She giggles again. "Granny someone is staying here. Is the room okay?"
Robin tilts his head and looks at me. "Sweet girl!" Granny appears with a laundry basket at the door, peering down the hall at Robin. "Of course. The sheets are all ready." She quickly moves down the hall and smiles at us. "Enjoy your stay."
Robin reaches his room and turns to me. "Oh." I pat Mary's head as she hands him the key. "And no loud... Music past 8:00pm please." I take Mary's hand. "Just so you don't disturb the other guests."

"He was pretty." Mary yawns, tugging on one of my shirts. She stood in the doorway of my closet as I pulled on a silk nightgown.
"He was handsome." I agree, trying not to laugh. Mary yawns, her eyes fluttering. "Alright baby. Bed time." I scoop her into my arms and huffed dramatically. "Dear me you've grown since the last time I carried you."
Mary smiles and strokes my hair. "Do I get to sleep with you?" She mumbles as I lay her in the bed.
"Yes." I whisper, tucking her in. "You do. Now I have to go to the bathroom and take off my makeup. Okay? Then I'm going to get two glasses of water from the downstairs kitchen. I'll be right back okay? You lay here and try to sleep." I instruct.
