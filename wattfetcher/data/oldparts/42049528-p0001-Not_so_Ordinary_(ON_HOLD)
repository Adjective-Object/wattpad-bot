"Maria get your lazy ass up" my brothers yells from downstairs.
"Okay! I am coming geez wait a minute" I yell back
Gosh why do brothers have to be so annoying. I know we are starting a new school, but really I need my beauty sleep. Today is my fist day at Springs High School, I am so excited.
I hop out of bed take a shower with my favorite body scrub. After the shower I put on a pink skirt and white shirt. Then I straighten my long brown hair. I put my cherry lipgloss on, then I am done.
I go to where the stairs are but instead of walking down, I go on the banister and slide down.
"Weeeeee" I yell while sliding down the banister.
I have fully slid down the banister and one of my brothers ,Toby, roles his eyes at me. Oh well he is missing out. My brother Toby is one year older than me he is 17, while I am 16. Then there is Chris who is 15 and Cole who is 18. My parents are rarely home they are always on business trips. That is what they say, I never really see them. It sucks a lot but now me and my brothers have a special bond. We are always there for each other no matter what.
I walk into the kitchen and am greeted by my other brothers Chris and Cole. They are so immature for there ages but so am I oh well.
Yay, I have to ride with my two idiot of brothers! Wish me luck!
