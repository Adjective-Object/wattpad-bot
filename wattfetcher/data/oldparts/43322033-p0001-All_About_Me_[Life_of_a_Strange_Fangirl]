My name is Jaleisa Brielle Jones. I was born February 27, 2001 in Valdosta, Georgia. I'm 14 years old and I've been moving all over the world because my parents are in the military. I've been to 11 different schools. I know this might not be important but I'm African American with a little Native American in my blood line. I've been all round Europe in Germany, Austria, Rome, etc. But unfortunately I was too young to remember. I've also been to Omaha, Nebraska, Mexico, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and the Bahamas. I'm constantly living in hot Florida and might move in my 10th grade year to California or back to Georgia. I want to go to California though :)) I'll add pictures soon....
