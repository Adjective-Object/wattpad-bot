Riker PVMe and the band were waiting backstage and we were about to go on in 10 minutes. Ross was walking over to me. I didn't know why but I kind of didn't want to be near him because I have this feeling in my stomach when he is near me. It's not like a pain in my stomach but it's like butterflies. It's been happening for a while now. Anyways, Ross walked up to me and said, "Are you ready?" I nodded in reply. He then smiled and winked at me. He walked away to talk to his siblings and my "butterflies" went through the roof. I tried really hard not to smile. The stage manager told us we were on in 5 and the crew handed us our instruments and all of us walked over to the stage curtain next to the stage. I saw Rocky, Rydel, and Rattliff together getting pumped for the show. Only 3 minutes left and I was about to walk over to Rocky and the others but I tripped and kind of awkwardly fell into Ross. He caught me and I said sorry. "It's okay, man." I could hear the screaming crowd in the background when all of a sudden Ross did the most unexpected thing ever. He grabbed my shirt, pulled me towards him and kissed me! It lasted for about 5 seconds and before I could say anything after he pulled away, the band including Ross walked up on stage and the crowd screamed uncontrollably. I followed behind Ross and tried to control my mixed emotions. Me and Ross performed that night like nothing ever happened.
