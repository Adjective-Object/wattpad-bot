Time must have passed, because Jane had been dreaming. "Maaaammy" "Maaaammy" "Maaaammy." Jane sat bolt upright. "I can't leave her like that, Andrew; I'll check on her" Andrew pulled the duvet tighter, hearing his wife's footsteps fade as she crossed the landing.
"AGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! AGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!! AGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
His wife was once again frozen in the doorway of their daughter's bedroom. Inching forward, the sight that met Andrew's eyes would live with him for the rest of his life. There on the play-rug lay the remains of his daughter, Amy, her body... headless. One arm close by, ripped from the shoulder socket; a torn off leg, lying at an impossible angle. Thick crimson blood oozed from each ghastly wound. Inches away, the head stared upwards, the knowing eyes dark and still.
Andrew ran to the painted box. Lifting the lid, there they were, perfectly repaired, three identical dolls, facing upwards... curly hair, the same prim white dress, the same innocent smile frozen on each face, three pairs of eyes, dark and deep staring up.
