Dear Kim Jongin,                     April 20, 2010
Jongin,  it's have been a while since I seen you.
Maybe because I'm jealous of you and Taemin hanging out too much?
I think being friends isn't easy.
It's my first day writing in this journal. I'm making many friends here,  but I have to go to school.
My school friends think I'm weird.  I became quieter than I was before.
Mikyung is a nice girl, and I think I'm falling in love with
Goodnight,  Jongin.
