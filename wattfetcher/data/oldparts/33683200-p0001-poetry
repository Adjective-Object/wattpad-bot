I'm stare at you from a distance,I wish I can get your attention,You may think I'm too young to feel these things but you're never too young to fall for someone,
Ever since I saw you I couldn't get you out of my head,At first I thought the small crush will blow over like the rest,
Put that small crush soon turned into love,You somehow ended up in my dreams,A place for anything could happen,
I pray to God that you will someday be mine no matter how long it takes,Even if it happens in the worst situations,
I'll never give up on us!
