I'll tell you straight-out, without preamble: This is not a work of fiction.
This is not a tale spun solely for the purpose of putting rowdy children to sleep. I am not taking the time to write this down for your amusement; I'm putting pen to paper because I was asked to chronicle my journey, and that's it. Kitt would do it, if not for his hatred of writing; I wouldn't ask Zeo, it'd be too much of a bother for him.
That leaves me.
I'll tell this story in my own way, at my own pace, with as much detail and truth as I can remember; not every little thing will be accurate, and you can blame my foggy mind for that.
Everything is foggy these days, but I suppose that's beside the point.
I should mention that this is not for the faint of heart. Hell, half the time, I can't even handle what happened to us. Be warned, that's all. I won't repeat myself whenever I start a new installment.
Well... all that's left is to begin, then.
