Cameron has been out for as long as i can remember, and whenever we get the chance to talk about our favorite guys in or out of school we go for hours. 'The boys' are my moms cousins, we all go to the beach every year and Cameron asks about them and their 6-packs every second he can.
"They're just as fit and gorgeous as ever. And i see you two haven't seen much sun yet!" i say teasingly, while tapping Page's white shoulders.
"Shut up." She says as she removes my hand. "Hey have you ordered yet?"
"Yeah I'm guessing its almost ready, you guys?"
"No, we ought to get in line, find us a table when u get yours!" Cameron answers and both of them walk towards the now growing line. I smile as i see them walk down. I missed them so much.
But i cant help but wonder who that guy was. He walked with such confidence, as if he owned the place. And i decided that i didn't have set feelings about him, whether they were good or bad. I probably would never even see him again, so its not like he mattered or anything, right?
But thats where i was so wrong.
