My friends and I were outside the school talking. We were talking about random stuff. Then after a 10 minute we decided to go inside. When we got inside nobody was there. I just shrugged it off but u will admit it was not normal. - Ok guys we should split up but I'm not in any team I'm going alone ok, I said.- No way, they all said angrily.I just ignored what they said.- Ok Jihane and Ana you're going to be downstairs and Soulef, Laurie and Stasea are going to be upstairs ok, I said.-Ok but where are you going to be? -I'll be upstairs don't worry, I said.We all went were we needed to go. I was in a white hallway, I ran to each classroom to see if they were open. No luck all of them were locked so I went downstairs in the same hallway. When I went downstairs all of the classrooms were open. When I went in one of them, I searched in the drawers. After searching for a bit I found a letter. I opened the letter. When I read it,I screamed to my friends to come. - JIHANE, ANA,SOULEF,LAURIE, STASEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They all ran till they found me. They were all scared because they though something bad happened.- LOOK!!!!!!!!!!! They all looked at the letter and looked at me in shock.
