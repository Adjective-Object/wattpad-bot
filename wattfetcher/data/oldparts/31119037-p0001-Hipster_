So, here begins my collection of free verse, often angsty and depressive, poetry. I would like to thank @ChickNAlfredo, @ZheDollophead and every one else for encouraging me to write more. Thank you guys so much! [epecially for your support of my other poetry collectionÂ Wonderland]
I hope you enjoy it! I also hope you do well in Chemistry cos, right now, I'm not.
