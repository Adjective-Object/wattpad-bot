I ask "I'm worried about you ever since Shane cheated on you your health when down hill" "what ever!" That's a normal talk with Joey. He's been worried about me ever since my ex-boyfriend cheated on me with Lisa. "Listen Hollister I want you to be happy but I can't let you do drugs!" Joey never recognized my scars but Joey can be that way like he didn't realize how disappointed I was(and still am) knowing he will never like me how I like him but I will always respect his choice I mean he's my best friend and really my only friend "Hol! Are you even listening to me?" "I'm going out" "where?" "Places Joey places!" "Hollister!" "Joesph!" I mocked leaving to Markpliers or my brother Marky "MARKY!!!" "What did you do now?" Mark laughed "Haha very funny I can't just visit my big bro?""You and Joey got in a fight?" Shoot I can't tell him I took drugs! "Yea, over freakin' laundry!"
