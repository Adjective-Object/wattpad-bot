Haven has the prefect life. She has a football player of a boyfriend. Her best friends are cheerleaders, and her parents are loaded with money. Her life is set out for her the moment she was born.
She has to be perfect.
It's only been a month since school started and she has already found herself falling down the wrong path. This path was written with one person who she starts to hang out with.
Connor Myers.
He teaches her to let loose sometimes. She even finds herself with Connor in her pool way past midnight with barely any clothes on.
Soon she finds herself falling for Connor when she knows she has the perfect boyfriend and she finds herself with the wrong friends when she knows she has perfect ones.
But is perfect what she wants?
Her friends tried to tell her that once Connor leaves her, she's going to be all alone and Haven couldn't help but think:
What will happen when he leaves?
