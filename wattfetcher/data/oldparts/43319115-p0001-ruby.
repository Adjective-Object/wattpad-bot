PROLOGUE

Ruby Simmons used to be the girl her mother would hug for hours and share a can of soda pop and popcorn with as they both watched their favorite movies and gossiped about some cute guy from school and they'd both giggle like school girls. She used to be the girl her father took to the local diner and they'd share a chocolate milk-shake as they watched the busy cars on the highway nearby pass, driving into a new adventure, maybe even a new life.
Now, Ruby's once perfect world was shaking and cracking like a level twenty earthquake, if a level twenty earthquake even existed. She was once happy, maybe happier than happy if that was possible, but now a severely saddened puppy lost in a massive rainstorm looking for its owners took her place. She was being torn in two different directions.
"So, Ruby what's your answer?" asks her mother, Ruby loved both her parents with so such love that it was disgusting. Since they divorce authorized, she being made to choose. Father, or Mother. Sighing as she covers her face frustratingly the same questions were driving herself mad, the girl disliked tough questions, but she couldn't avoid them, they were everywhere. "Can I think about it a little more please?" Ruby was answers with frustration on her pink dry tongue, the older version of Ruby sighs and walks away from the kitchen table, Her usual preppy walk was now replaced with a more lazy, droopy walk.
A new life, a new start was what Ruby wanted, but to leave her mother alone was scary, they were always together but Ruby wanted a different school to attend, her school was full of nasty queen bees, no they were more like ants. Annoying, small and everywhere. They'd chant rude things to Ruby because of her wardrobe, it wasn't her fault that she didn't like short mini skirts short enough to show the world her lace underwear and sometimes they called her "Big Rube," because of the extra twenty pounds Ruby gained over the summer, which she still haven't lost. Large flannels, that used to be her father's and jeans that weren't tight and not too loose, she'd roll up about an inch above her ankles along with her childish socks that had cartoon characters on them, that's what she wore everyday. Tacky is what they'd call her, she liked her style no matter how many queen ants didn't.
"Ruby, your father is on the phone, he wants to know your answer," The brain inside her head throbs even worse than it was an hour ago, These people are giving me a migraine, Ruby thought. Her long, chunky legs straighten as she walks toward her ugly pink bedroom instead of to the yellow phone in her mothers hand.
"I want to be left away Jodie and Mark," with that said she curls in her bed with the giraffe stuffed animal she's owned since she turned the age of two and her eyelids close sending her into a deep slumber that honestly didn't last as long as she desired it to because of her mother interrupting to talk about Ruby's options.
Hello, I've been reading a lot of books lately and they have somewhat inspired to read something that seems more realistic. I want to write something that most people can relate to, I want to try to add good details and more this story appealing, I want to work hard at reading this book.
I want to warn that this book may contain triggering themes (further along) just keep your eye out.
I really suck at trying to describe what the book is about, sorry about that. Ruby's parents are divorcing and she has to make some important decisions such as staying in her hometown with her mother and few friends, or start over.
I wanted to show the struggles Ruby goes through with finding herself and learning to say how she feels and express that, the struggles of being yourself when nobody wants you to. The struggles of being a teenager.
Enjoy if you're reading! Make sure to save to your library, I'll update soon maybe tomorrow!
