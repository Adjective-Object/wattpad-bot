Hi there!
First of all, Andrew is the most adorable human being on Earth and I'd give anything just to touch a thin tendril of his hair. I mean, is it soft? Is it rough like normal curly hair? Please enlighten me!
Anyways, I've always wanted to write a story with a bit more 'flavour' and introduce a 'the person who can't forget' character and apparently Andrew seems a very down-to-earth person who would be able to deal with someone suffering from hyperthymesia (google it up!).
I hope you will enjoy the story and dare to say your honest opinion in comments or messages. ^w^
