Maxine groaned, her alarm clock buzzed. "Shut up." She mumbled and hit the button, "Maxine, sweetie." Her mother called. "Coming." Maxine replied falling out of bed, she grabbed her clothes than walked to the bathroom, she put on a white shirt, skinny jeans and nikes. First day of middle school. Max ate her lucky charms then picked up her backpack, her and a boy loaded on the bus, the boy would twitch and crack his neck. She looked at him and her face lit up, she was blushing. The boy got pushed around like a soccer ball. The kids called him names. Max raised her tone, "Leave him alone." She told the kids who where picking on him, the boy twitched. His face was bloody, the bus pulled over as Toby moved up to max. "What's your - " the boy would twitch, "name." The boy finishes his sentence, "Maxine, but call me max." Max smiles, "I'm Toby." Toby twitched, "thanks for sticking up for me." Toby gulped. Max looked around in her backpack, she pulled out a rag, "clean your face off, Toby." She sighed. He cleaned off his face, "ticci Toby!" One of the bully snickers. Toby began to look at max, tears forming in his eyes. "LEAVE HIM ALONE!" She raised her tone higher. "I'm sorry, Toby." Max cries. He wraps his arms around her.
