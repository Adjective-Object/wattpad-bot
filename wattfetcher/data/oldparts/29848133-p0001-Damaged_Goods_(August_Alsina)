"When you coming back, Key?" My best friend Lucky asked me. I didn't know what to tell him, and I wasn't going to lie. We were at the airport. I asked him to drop me off.
"On the real Luck, I don't know." I said.
"You really wanna do this?" He asked.
"I mean yeah, when I get back I plan to be set. I got a good job waiting for me down in Miami , a gig, a dorm. I'm leaving to heal. I'll see you on your birthday, you'll be 21. You always say you wanna go to the strip in Miami on your birthday." I said with tears falling down my cheeks."
"I love yo bean head ass aight, I got my nigga Aug to pick you up from the airport. I even talked him into letting you whip his old joint. " He said, and I wanted to kick his ass for it.
"Why would you do that you kno-?" Then Luck cut me off.
"Hol up girl,let me finish. We cool, he lived in NOLA with me. He owes me anyways. He yo age too youngin'." I rolled my eyes at him. He's only a year older than me."Oh, and you look older than 19 so when them niggas try to fuck with you. Well, I slipped a taser in your purse." Lucky added. I heard them call my flight. Now im about to cry like a baby.
"Well love, I guess this is goodbye." I said, and gave him a hug.
" Nah baby girl this is a see you later." he said, then kissed me on my forehead, hugged me back, and pulled my shirt down.
''Cake too poppin, gotta to keep these niggas away from my babygal."I laughed, kissed him on the cheek and walked towards my flight. I put on my shades to cover up my now, red eyes.
"Aye,wait up Key!"I turned around and saw Lucky.
"I forgot to give you your going away present." He slipped this envelope in my coat pocket, kissed my cheek, and then ran off.
