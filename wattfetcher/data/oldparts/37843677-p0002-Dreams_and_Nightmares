Ghost slowly moved his closer so that there lips where slowly brushing against each other. A moment later Ghost moved forward and closed his eyes as he pressed his lips more firmly against his, forming a soft kiss. It lasted a second until Ghost moved away and looked into Toast's cute blushing face and wide blue eyes.
Toast was silent for a moment as he looked into his boss's brown eyes again. He was quick to respond as he moved forward and crashed his lips onto his boss's. He started to slowly wrap his arms tightly around him. Ghost's eyes widened in surprise and his face turned a darker shade of red. They both felt like it lasted an eternity but in reality it was only about a minute until they pulled away for air.  They both smiled at each other in silence.
"Good morning sir..." Toast chuckled cutely.
Ghost poked Toast's nose. "Morning Johnny..."
Toast moved forward giving his boss a quick kiss on his cheek.
"I'll go make us some breakfast and tea... Ok?"
Ghost didn't want to get up, he wanted to stay here with Toast and cuddle. But he knew that they both had work to do.
"Ok," Ghost let go. Only to quickly wrap his arms around him again.
"One last hug..."

Does anyone even ship them anymore or am I the only one  •_•
I wrote this on the cruise at like one in the morning... I couldn't sleep... And this happened...
After writing this I had a weird korrasami dream... I'm probably the only one who watched that show...
I'm know this is awful but... Why not... I ship them...
I'm probably going to lose followers or get hate or something...
Meh... Whatever...
