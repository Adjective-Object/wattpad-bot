It was the 1st day of April.Walking down the road silently wearing navy converse, black skinny jeans, a white tank top and an unbuttoned red plaid shirt was Emma Wayes.Her beautiful brown waves were hanging by her shoulders
She was heading towards her new school as she recently just moved houses.From a small apartment she used to share with her mom, her dad and her two younger brothers Jake and Damond who were eight and five years old to a big house in a rich state where they all had their own bedroom and had four bathrooms and a swimming pool.
Her dads job sent them here to this house and payed for all of it but Emma didnt want to move.To leave everything she has created behind.To leave all her friends and her boyfriend Zach who she missed so much.
Her new school Redwood High is where she heard all the rich popular students went but of course she expected normal people to be there too.Normal people as in others that werent as rich as well as geeks and other nerds.
Emma was a kind sweet hearted girl and hoped to become friends with atleast one person that could show her around but as well as that she was very anxious and scared.
