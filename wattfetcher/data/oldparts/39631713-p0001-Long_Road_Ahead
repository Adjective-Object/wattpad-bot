It was my early sixteenth year in late spring. I was sitting in my favourite rocking chair- The one my mom gotten me when I was two, before she died. I never did get to know her.  But I always thought it was better this way, so I didn't have to save the deep, loving memories that would hold on in the future.      I was reading my favorite novel, 'Eternally Broken' rocking  in my rocking chair in a steady rhythm that I could make a pattern out of. The pattern seemed normal, like it's beat would continously consist in rock back, rock forth, and so on. I wish my life was a steady pattern. But it's anything but steady. It's actually just a mess. No steady pattern, just ricochet.     My name is Ellie Mariee. I have short, golden brown hair and brown eyes. I'm rather short. People in my old school used to call me "shorty" or "smalls". Sad, but true. My life pretty much sucks. My dads kind of a dead beat. He's not there for me. Always busy in 'work' or i'm simpily not good enough for him. I don't have any friends. Not that i'm weird, I'm just a very quiet person, you could say. Its hard to talk to people without me wanting to run away. Lets face it, I'm antisocial. Nobody seems to understand me..
