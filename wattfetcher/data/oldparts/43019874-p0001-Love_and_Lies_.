Chapter 1: where it all began
Dominique .
" neek neek im starving ,i swear if i dont eat anything im gonna die from starvation . " my little sister deriyon whined . she's so dramatic its a shame , but i know she was starving because i was too . we both havent eaten since yeserday we fell asleep waiting on our brothers to get inside last night but they never came home.
to say i was worried about them is an understatement . i was literally puling my hair waiting on them to call , respond to my texts or something . this is one of the things I hate about my brothers being drugdealers. before I can even think of the worst scenarios i pushed the thoughts aside and went upstairs to put on some clothes so me and my little sister can eat .
I didn't feel like getting dressed up , and I wasn't going nowhere important just to get some food , so i slipped on a pair of black danskin yoga pants along with a black halfcut tanktop , showing my hip piercings and belly ring , and added my prism adidas zx flux putting my hair in a neat bun .
" let's go " i told yonnie and she looked at me confused . "to get something to eat dummy " i told her .
"yaayyyy " she sang like a baby . greedy child .
we went to applebees since I wanted some of their buffalo wings . as i was eating i felt somebody staring a hole in the side of my face. i looked over seeing it was some guy just staring at me . usually when you staring at some one and that person looks at you people turn their head but he kept looking at me with a smirk on his face .
i blushed and looked into my phone . "you done with that ? " yonnie asked me pointing to my hot wings and fries .
"no im gonna eat it after this boy stops staring at me " i said . it's not that i eat sloppy i just can't eat when someone's looking at me , it's disturbing .
" im gonna go tell him to get out your face " she said standing up .
"yonnie noo " i told her knowing she would really do it .
"chill im just going to the bathroom " she said .
i picked up a fry and dipped it into ketchup before sticking it in my mouth. "hey ma " I heard somebody say .
I looked up seeing the boy that was staring at me . I swear I didn't even notice him walk up to the table .
"hey da " i said trying to be funny .
he chuckled . "so you like to crack jokes ? " he started . " but I know you saw me staring at you . you pretty as hell can I get your number ? " he asked me .
me being Dominique , I love to play hard to get . " I don't give my number out easily . if I see you again then It must be meant for you to get my number . " I told him .
" so you one of those girls but you should  know i be everywhere ma . it's no gonna be hard running into you . believe that " he said walking off .
yonnie walked to the table with a stupid smirk on her face . "mmhm " she sang .
I just ignored her pettiness because I was finally getting a call from my twin brother . "Dorien where the hell yall at man , do yall know how worried I was ? " I asked him .
"im pretty sure you were worried thats a good thing because I know you care about me . but me and Taetae aren't in town right now . we got into some shit and we're thinking of a plan to take these nighas down . we have to be away from yall for yalls safety , i love yall though " he said .
"I love you too . put taetae on the phone . " i heard shuffling before taetae got on the phone .
