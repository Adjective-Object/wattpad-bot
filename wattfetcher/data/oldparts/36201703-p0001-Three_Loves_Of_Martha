Prologue


Martha has never been searching for love. Until today it was finding her and when she least expect it love finds her more than once. Too many options to choose especially when you don’t think you are worth it. Martha is running from love and sure when she turns around there will be no one chasing her. Until today – when running was impossible. Blocking the way one man but could it be? Has love finally found her?
