All of this would be awkward if I didn't introduce myself, wouldn't it?
Hi, I'm Annie. I am what people might call, "Da Author". But that sounds a little formal. And I'm not a formal person.  So Annie works fine.
I am an utterly hopeless mess. I eat Nutella like ice cream. I'm allergic to cats (tragic, isn't it?). I know every song to every Disney movie ever. I own 8 pairs of Doc Martens... so far. And at the moment, I'm wearing a Link shirt.
Sorry, this wasn't necessary.
But seriously, please no stealing my writing. Also, please don't use it without my consent or permission. Love suggestions, dislike hate. The opinions in this story are either mine or a character's. Expressing opinions is a right. You may disagree, but don't try to raise hell or set me on fire. Thanks.
~Annie
