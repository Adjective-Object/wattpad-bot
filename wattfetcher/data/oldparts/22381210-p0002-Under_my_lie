"Huh?Ohh!" she remembered, " Yeahhh!" I gave her a smile and she began talking...................................................
It was now 11:45 pm and it was getting late so they all decided to leave. Back to my room , the place was so messy. Today was different. No truth or dare. The boys kept playing thier games and later came to join us with thier latest gossip.
Sometimes, it just shocks me how boys can have more gossip than girls.
"Ahh,atlast!" relaxing on my bed . The room was all clean now. Just going through my phone to see if I had any messages when I came across two. One from my bro ( in Britain..yhh I wasn't the only child) and one from Tiff.
I opened Tiff's own and it read , "tnx a lot Mimi, we really had a blast..ttyt."
Not even before I closed Tiffs own I was fast asleep.
