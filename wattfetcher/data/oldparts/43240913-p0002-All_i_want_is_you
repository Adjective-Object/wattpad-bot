"Like what you see." I said with my signature smirk on my face. The girl's face went red.
"oh my gosh I feel so embarrassed."
"So what's your name?" I asked her admiring her beautiful body. She made me forget all about Jamie.
"Layla." She said smiling sheepishly. I got her where I wanted her. It looks like she works out. Now I'm going to have to tell Jamie to do yoga. I'm not bout to let her push weights and do pull ups she might leave me and try to fight.
"I'm David." I lied to her. I don't want these easy girls knowing my name.
"Let me get your number." Layla then got a pen and paper out her pusre and wrote down a number. I stared at her as she walked down the aisle. I went to the register and paid for my stuff and left. It was 5:39 when I walked in the house. I woke Jamie up for she can get ready.
Jamie's p.o.v
When Trevon woke me up saying he has a surprise for me I was excited. Maybe he is starting to change for the better. Or at least I hope.
