"And I you, Ana, we'll be downstairs, I'll let you get ready" he kisses me once more and leaves the room, holding Ted on his hip. What a lovely way to wake up- to my boys.
Within twenty-five minutes I am showered, dressed and made-up. It's amazing how quickly you learn to dress once you're a parent. I make my way downstairs into the kitchen area. Christian is standing in front of Ted who is sitting on the counter of the breakfast bar. Teddy is playing with Christian's tie and I suspect this is the reason that his tie was loose this morning. Mrs Taylor is busy making breakfast.
"Good morning Ana, what would you like for breakfast?" She asks sweetly. Thank god that she's over the 'Mr's Grey' formality.
"I'd like some granola please Mr's Taylor" I reply equally as sweet.
Christian looks at me bemused, but wisely holds his tongue. I don't like eating big breakfasts, he needs to understand this.
Once I'm finished my breakfast I walk over to Christian and Teddy. His little arms fly apart as I reach for him, placing him on my hip although it's a little uncomfortable. So, it's 8:24 and we're all dressed and ready. Not bad timing really.
"Teddy will you let daddy hold you whilst mummy puts her coat on?" I ask gently.
"No" Teddy refuses and clings around my neck tighter. He smells lovely. I should let Christian get him ready in the mornings more often. Although I do love doing it.
"We're going in daddy's brum brum". His eyes widen. He loves going in the car. He leans over as Christian reaches out for him, holding him close as he kisses his hair.
