Hello.
So I started a story for Marvel imagines and preferences etc. and I thought I'd do more on other things.
In this book I will write any form of fanfictiony thing (preference, song fic, imagine, one shot etc.) on these:
-          Criminal Minds
-          Once Upon a Time
-          Castle
-          Gossip Girl
-          Pretty Little Liars
-          The Vampire Diaries
-          Arrow
-          American Horror Story
-          Scrubs
-          Lost
-          Baby Daddy
-          Casualty
-          Outnumbered
-          Teen Wolf
-          Lord of the Rings
-          Anything Disney
-          Percy Jackson
There will probably be other things I'll write about but I can't think of them, just ask and I'll see if I can write them. If you'd like something Marvel:
-          Avengers
-          X-Men
-          Fantastic 4
-          Spiderman
-          Guardians of the Galaxy
-          Agents of SHIELD
Then you may request here but I'll post them on my other book.
If you have any requests or suggestions them please PM me or comment them.
Thank you c:
