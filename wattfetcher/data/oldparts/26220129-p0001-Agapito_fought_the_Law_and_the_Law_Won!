Agapito Ilustrado looked at the computer screen for a third time. He had been shocked to see the results were not in his favor. This had been the second time he had attempted to pass his bar exam, and this was his second failure at such attempt. Maybe he should haved studied more, read more, been more serious about the test. Or maybe, just maybe his family was entirely correct, he just doesn't have the stuff to be a good lawyer. Whatever the reasons, he knew for a fact that those results on the screen showed he did not pass.
