I ran through the thick woods, almost ready to collapse. Ever since the World has gone to crap, iv'e been running trying to find some food and shelter. The only weapon I had was a kitchen knife from my house before it got burned down by the American Army.
I decided to stop running for a while, and sit down. I think I deserve a bit of time to relax, with a bit of looking over my shoulder.  I pulled my blond wavy hair into a pony tail. And closed my blue eyes to think of where I could go.
As I opened my eyes, I saw a barbed wire fence and a red rusty wall, which I was assuming was a front gate. I saw no walkers inside the area, so I decided to check it out. I dodged some stray walkers and made my way up to the front gate.  I saw a boy about my age, and a man, taking a wild guess that it was his father.
I started to circle the premises, when the boy pointed and shouted to his father that he saw a living person. The man looked up from his farming and ran to the gate to where I was with a huge hunting rifle pointed to my head. "shit" I thought, the stupid kid gave away my cover.
