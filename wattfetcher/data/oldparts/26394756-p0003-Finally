My eyes are dull brown. The only thing still looks alive is my hair long, black as midnight and curly. I don't look like my dad, he had brown hair and honey color eyes. I think I look like my grandma she had brown eyes my hair however remained a mystery. I'm though grateful I look nothing like that man.
"Its fine Lisa you shouldn't even be working you should be at school making your dreams come true, but instead your working your butt off for nothing." My mom tries to make me feel better it's not working. Becaus everyday that passes I feel that my dreams could slip through my fingers more and more each day. Then one day I will be nothing but a lifeless person with no hope what so ever. But then I remember there are people who in the world have absolutely nothing. I think of how our lige would be if we were still living with that man and how truly then we would be dead in the inside. We would be nothing but puppets living until it was time for us to leave this world.
"Look I can ask my boss if I could work more hours and-"
"NO. You will not work more, Mom I will find a job that can pay me more and then when we have a enough. Maybe I could go back and go to college." I interrupt, I will not make her work more if the only thing in my life is to make my mom happy so be it. I will bring and be her biggest joy in life. That I promise.
