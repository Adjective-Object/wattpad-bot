Mastrophobia is an irrational fear of breasts.
It's also the word Justin likes to use before he begs one of his teammates to give him a handjob at the back of their tour bus.
So when almost the whole team wants to know why their star player is constantly asking this of them, Justin puts up his defences and lets them 'know' he's not gay, just in need of some action sexually.
Even if most of his team consists of gay and bisexual boys from a few different parts of the world, Justin still is the guy whose locked himself in the closet and refuses to come out.
But maybe that'll change when there's a new team member who almost immedietly takes the role as the rising star.
Author's Note; I can feel judgement but stahp haha.
Okay, this is going to be the kind of book I'd update when I feel like writing it.
So that means, I could upload frequently - or every once in a while (sorry)
but the more votes and shit I get will determines the amount of uploads I'll do.
So please let me know how you feel about this story!
By the way, its gonna have loads of (b)romances in it which will include boys from One Direction (including Zayn bc ftw) and 5SOS (Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!) and a few viners!
Thanks for reading!
