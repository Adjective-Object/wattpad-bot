Hello my name is Calypso Moon Unfortunately , I will never know why I was cursed with my terrible name, BecauseI was adopted. When I was 7 years old I was lucky enough to be adopted my the Anderson family. Not lucky to be adopted by them , but to be adopted period.When they adopted me we got in a car crash on the way home to New York. I survived . Mr.Anderson didn't. Shortly after mrs.Anderson got into alcohol and took her life. So that meant that I had to live my grandmother ,Alice in Las Vegas . And I am happy I did.
Ten years later I'm now a senior in high school. This year is my last year of high school before college (or whatever I do ) and I can't wait to get out.
