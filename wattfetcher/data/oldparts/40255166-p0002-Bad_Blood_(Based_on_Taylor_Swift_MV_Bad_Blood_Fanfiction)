I felt betrayed. But i'm not sure if its true or not." I tell her."Then screaming loud. It helps." Domino said."Okay." I said to her as i stand up and screaming louder."It helps right?" Domino said."You were right." I tell her."In here, you were trained and makes you who you are. They will know who you really are. You aren't weak. That's why Welvin recruited you." Domino said."You're right, Dom." I tell her as she smile at me."Let's go to sleep, there will be more days to go." Domino said as i chuckled.
