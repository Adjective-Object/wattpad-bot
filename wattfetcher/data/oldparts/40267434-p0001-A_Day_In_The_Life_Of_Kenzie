I'll explain. (All characters in this story are based on real life characters, do not copywrite these characters or their personalities, that would be like cloning.)
I was sitting in my, 'maths classroom'.Facing Sa-- lly...? And her friend L-- isa...?They were two of my other friends.We were talking about quite a racist topic.."Aren't white people ONLY Australians and Americans?" I asked. "Yeah, I think so" replied Sally. I widened my eyes, "So, since I'm European, that means I'm not white.. right?" I spoke loudly. 'Jane..?' (My so-called, 'best friend') pointed at me and said, "yes you are, you're white all over!",
----AHH! I hate her so much for saying that! I'm not proud of my skin tone! I hate it! THEY LAUGHED ABOUT IT!I can't believe they actually found it funny, and I can't believe I'm ranting about it! x<
