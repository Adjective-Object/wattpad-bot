" hey sis i love you , look dominque i know how you are and don't stress yourself out worrying about us . please don't because I promise you we're going to be okay and i don't want you to have another anxiety attack " he told me causing a tear to slip .
" I know . i just can't help but to worry about yall. please be safe because I don't know what I'll do if anything happen to yall " i sobbed.
"alright but we gotta go " he hung up.
i sighed . slumping down in my seat trying my best not to let tears fall from my eyes .
im not new to things like this . my brothers have had beef with a couple of people. it's just that one of them always ends up getting hurt and i keep telling them that instead of them ending up in a hospital it could be a casket but they don't listen to me , they never do .
allow me to give a proper introduction of myself. im dominique derrinisha matthews . seventeen years of age , senior in high school taking a.p classes . don't get the wrong idea of thinking im a nerd because im far from the that . im smart but I have a wild side too .
by me having no parents im free of doing whatever i want , well kind of . see my dad and uncle are in jail for 5 years serving a 10 year sentence for 3rd degree murder . they were kingpins like Deekie and taetae . they had beef with some people and when people can't get to you they got after people you love so they pushed my auntie , TaeTae's mom off the bridge and my mom she got hooked onto drugs badly once all of this happened and I guess one day she coudnt take it nomore and she left . that leaves me taetae , deekie and yonnie on our own. taetae was 9 years old selling weed to take care of us 3 children .
