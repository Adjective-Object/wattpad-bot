Faye: already near the end of reviewing this heavy metal bands performance and I have got to say they sound aggressive.Â  So what about you what's with the sudden confidence of yours huh it's not like they picked me over you yet already didn't they?
Me: You know they love you the most right you know how self righteous they get over what you bring to the table.
Faye: Maybe it's because I'm a little bit more confident into what bars I go to on where I find talent.
Me: you know If you keep pushing my buttons you're going to push the wrong one.
Faye: You're just scared that I'm going to be first to put suggestions on the corporation admit it man it's just like a sudden plague washes over you.
Me: you've got a band to listen to and I gotta get some sleep to kill of a certain cherry daiquiri.
Faye: You're still hitting the sauce huh?
Me: That's because your a very mild over achiever hey I bet you don't even meditate like I do.
Faye: You're right because I despise meditation....
See what I tell ya about this soon to be big fish in a tiny pond I knew she had overachiever written all over her face.
Me: alright alright no more talking about meditation tell me somethin' what is the bands name now that you got me interested?
Faye: they mix thrash metal with hip-hop and it's just absolutely awesome I am already in love with their sound.
Me: You know I am really thinking about getting a new so that I can just block your father a second time.
Faye: oh god look I know you two don't get along with my family because their racist towards sudden ethnicities but they said it themselves they love you and they love it when you do your famous strawberry shortcakes. They just don't like most of the friends that we hang out with.
Me: because they are either from the Somoan islands, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Germany, England, or they're just country.
Faye: yeah speaking of that uh my F.Y.I. Daddy changed his freaking number again.
Me: what is the new number said is of I always thought it would be 666?
Faye: goodnight David.
Me: Goodnight Faye.
As the phone call I ends as soon as I try to walk safely to another street corner I see a mugging take place I fend for the man with beer bottle.
Me: hey yo Jackasses.
I threw it straight at them with the purpose of getting into a fight but it backfired as I hit a windshield of a Volkswagen golf. You would say that this would be my time to run to the moon to yeah about that mugging that took place It was a teenage girl and her clothes were stripped. Exposing everything that she had I guess you could say she's damaged goods now.
I drive the micro bus straight into a Harlem free parking garage as I see someone spray painting the walls in front of me and a child being kidnapped by somebody in a similar micro bus as ours. They do not deserve a micro bus like ours if all they're going to be doing is raping children.
I stay with the Brooklyn police department to tell them my story she was wearing a my chemical romance tee with black denim jeans her jacket were two different striped blues. One stripe was light as the other was navy blue see that is the thing about this world today it is so......
