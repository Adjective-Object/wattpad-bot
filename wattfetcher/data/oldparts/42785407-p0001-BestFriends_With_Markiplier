.:FLASHBACK:.
It was dark, I was with Mark and we where camping with my brother and parents while his parents went for a night out. We heard leafs being crushed and and heard footsteps getting closer and closer. I hugged Mark tightly because he was in the same tent as me while the the rest of my family was in the other tent next to us. That was not a wise choice since mostly because I'm 8 and he's 9. I quickly took out a flash light out of the bag that was next to me and turned it on. I looked at Mark with a worried look and he looked at me the same. I slowly crawled to the opening of the tent and zipped up the zipper quickly and looked outside. Right there, their was a big brown bear eating all of the food that was hanging over the tree. The bear stopped what he was doing and stared at me. I quickly closed the tent and scurried next to Mark for comfort. I got in a ball and looked at him with my scared eyes and turned of the lights.........that's when everything went black. All I remember was screams of terror and being killed to death. The next thing I knew was being in a police car and seeing my Aunt crying while signing some sort of paper. I was scared. I didn't know where I was. I didn't see my family nor Mark and now I have to live wit my Aunt.
........HELP......ME.......PLEASE.......
