Together Kare and Kenzie were unstoppable and nothing could get in their way. That is until they met them...  A while ago Kare and Kenzie had met and at first the hated each other so much that even looking at each other made them want to throw up. Until one  fateful day when they decided they were sick of their lives and their parents always getting on to them and telling them what to do. So on the same night they packed up their stuff and snuck out the window. (oh and did I mention that they were neighbors?) so as they walked back they both ran into something hard so they turned around to find each other. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" "I ASKED YOU FIRST" "STOP COPYING ME" "IM NOT" "UGH" it turns out they had more in common than they thought. "ok I'm gonna be the mature one here so I'll say what I'm doing here. I'm tired of my parents being jerks so I decided I'm gonna runaway." said Kenzie. "no you can't runaway tonight that's when I decided I want to runaway." said Kare. Kenzie looked at Kare with a smirk on her face and thought 'well she has family issues like me and we both are rebels I think we'll get along just fine.' "Why are you looking at me weirdly?" Asked Kare. "well because I realized that me and you could've been friends all along instead of fighting." "so" "and we both need each other in case we gets lost then we have each other instead of nobody, just think about it Kare." *snap* "oh crap what was that?" Asked Kare. "I don't know and I don't plan on staying long enough to find out." replied Kenzie. so they both took off running and this is where their story began.
