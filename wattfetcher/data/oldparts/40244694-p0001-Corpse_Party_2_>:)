I opened my eyes and staggered back. I was back in the school.... Back in this nightmare.
"WHY!? GODDAMMIT WHY?!" I screamed in distress. I heard something move and saw Kyle sitting up in fear.
"Wh-where are we...." Kyle muttered in shock. I sighed and told him to follow me.
"Stan! Where are we!?" He repeated, trembling like crazy.
"This is the fucking place I told you about before! You were here! This all happened! And the whole fucking stories going to repeat itself!" I punched the wall in anger. "GODDAMMIT WHY! WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO HARD!" I raged and continued punching and kicking the wall. "IM SO SICK OF THIS PLACE!!"
Kyle just stood there and let my rage on.
After a couple of minutes, I stopped and stood there panting. "At least I'm not sick..." I heaved.
"Sick...?" Kyle asked confused.
"You wouldn't have remembered..." I sighed. "Come on... We gotta find the rest of the group... Wait.... We gotta go to the cafeteria!" I stammered, realizing I could finally get the food, even though I wasn't that hungry. But I knew after a week I would be. I grabbed Kyles hand and pulled him into the hallway so we could find the cafeteria.
