~_~_~_~_~_~_~In the books I write for you all. It shows I'm happy and full of hope and filled with wonders. But if you READ and looked closer. You can see it all reach to the point of my dark self. I am going to talk about dark things that I wanted to take off my chest. Some will stay but others won't. I mean, doesn't everyone have a dark side? ~_~_~_~_~_~_~
Don't you ever get that feeling where you could be happier when you hurt yourself. To get rid of that pain that haunts you everywhere you go. It helps but it's not permanent. Trust me, when I go dark. And it happens at night. I love to see and smell the small pure red liquid drip. The pain smoothing me. I say I'm fine. You could see my whicked smile. But look deeply into my eyes and see for yourself. Am I really fine?
