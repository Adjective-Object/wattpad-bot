"I need to ask you a question..." i was loosing my patience.
"Well ask it you dipshit" i hissed
"Watch it young lady...you don't know who you are talking to. But my question is, would you like some help?" to say i was taken back by his question was an understatement.
"Um excuse me?" i suddenly stopped struggling.
"Listen. I saw you outside of your school fighting that plastic barbie doll who was making fun of you. And if you have managed to keep me off of you for as long as you did...anyways. there is a place i want to take you. I promise you will like it. It's kind of like a safe haven for people like us." His words made me laugh because i called Rebecca that not even half an hour ago.
"And how do i know you aren't just going to kidnap me, rape me, then kill me?" i questioned. A soft laugh escaped his lips.
"Because Hannah. You are just like me and we are just like them." I didn't quite understand what he meant by that. He then released all of his body weight off of me and also released my hands from above my head.
"How do you know my name?" I never told him my name and somehow he knows it. That makes me uneasy.
"Tell you what. You come with me and ill show you this place. If you dont like it there then ill take you back home myself and we can pretend this never happened. I can also make sure my people don't come after you again.." i roughly gulped.
"What do you mean...again?" i questioned again. A smirk played out on his lips.
"Lets just say, you are lucky i'm the one my boss sent." He held out his large hand for me to grab ahold of. I made a choice i probably will regret later and grabbed his hand. Its something about the way he spoke to me that had me as putty in his hands. that also makes me uneasy but i want to see where this is heading.
"What do you say? Maybe on the way there we can get you a change of clothes. I'm pretty sure that shirt isn't supposed to be so red." He winked at me. The same smirk that Rebecca had on her face right before she got punched was on his face too and believe me i had the nerve to punch him too.
"If you know what's best for you, you wouldn't punch me." He said as if he read my mind.
"And how exactly did you know I wanted to punch you?" I tilted my head to the side just a little bit. He walked up close to me like he did when I first was in this situation and leaned his face next to my ear.
"Because I saw your face before you punch barbie." He whispered into my ear. I was a bit taken back as he chuckled lightly.
"And i'm going to repeat myself. If you know what's best for you, you aren't going to punch me. Ive had enough when I first got you back here." He winked one last time before grabbing my hand in his and walking me out of the alley and to his black car.
