Hello! I didn't see you there, my names Madison Milnes and I live in Ohio. There are way to many clouds around here, me and my best friend, Heather Bishop, hate it.
Hello! You may have heard of me fro- Dad! Turn the music down! Sorry, anyway, I'm Heather Bishop like Maddy said, and we both hate the clouds, and we love the sun, how weird.
Hey! I'm Ashton Irwin and the su- Oh My God Lucas, put your guitar away! Anyway, what I was saying was, and the sun is my best friend, well it was til me and Luke here moved to Ohio. It has wonderful people, but no sun.
Hi! I'm Luke Hemmings, and I love the sun, I burnt all the time, but I loved it. I think it's sorta a get away from clouds, but here, it's a total vacation from the sun. But I like it.
