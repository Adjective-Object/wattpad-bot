"Hiiii Nialler. Haven't seen you since the family thingy." She giggles. I look at him in confusion. "Oh, Kaitlin. I forgot to tell you. Me and Nialler are cousins. Wait, how do you know Nialler?"
"Ok, let's get you inside so you can sleep." I softly say knowing about her headache. She hums in response.
I try to help her walk. I attempt to unlock the door. And Niall, being the helpful gentleman he is, is on his phone playing "4 pics 1 word" or some shit. Once I unlock the door I've completely forgotten about my headache and basically mother her. By then Niall is inside his apartment blasting Bon Jovi. Respect to him.
