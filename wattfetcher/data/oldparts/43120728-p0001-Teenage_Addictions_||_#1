As I was lying in bed and it was already 1:24 am, I couldn't help but fantasize about my future. My brain was totally exploding with thoughts and I just couldn't seem to sleep. Okay. Maybe because I slept in till 4:00 pm the previous day. Back to the point, what does my future hold? Extremely magnificent income, married to the love of my life and be truly happy or become a stripper or end up as a lonely old woman? Hmm. The perks of being me, Alison Septembers. Despite the fact that I'm only 16 years of age, it still boggles my mind, you know, the whole thing about finding myself and what to believe in and who to let into your life and how to live properly.. its fucking frustrating actually. Okay I really have to sleep. I have school tomorrow. Not that I really fucking care but I need beauty sleep right.

I woke up to the sound of my father yelling. The usual. I swear if I was my mother,  I'd be divorced right now and far away from that man. He claims to be the "King of the house" which everyone in this house definitely disagrees to. He has some anger issues and so on. Who am I kidding, my father has major issues. He's words contridicts his actions and he is a fucking terrible person. He puts himself out to be a saint in other peoples eyes when in fact his the most dumbest, hypocritical and annoying person I know. He treats my mother like shit and everyone else in this damn house. But let's not start this day off shitty. I got up to go to the bathroom to have my usual morning cigarette, (I always smoke in the bathroom when my mothers at home because she does not quite, accept that I smoke). I stepped into the shower and stood under the hot water for about 20 minutes before actually washing. By the time I was all dressed in my uniform,  ready for school my lift had been outside waiting for me.

I got to school at 7:45 am. It was cold and foggy. The morning mist blinded the sight across the school field. I walked over to my clique of friends and greeted everyone. "Baby!" one of my closest friends, Kendall yelled and I hugged her tight and laughed, we sat down and each lit a cigarette. My clique was basically the smoking crew on the school so all the smokers were at our table before the 8:00 am bell rang for the beginning of the school day. Kendall and I spent the next 15 minutes gossiping and talking about random topics while smoking. 8:00 am the school bell rang and we had to say goodbye till our first lunch break which was at 10:10 am. School life in South Africa is pretty unique. And no South Africa is not a deserted place with shacks and poor people. Its a pretty amazing country and Cape Town was the most amazing, which is where I lived. I continued my day as usual, attending most of my classes and spending both my lunch breaks with my friends smoking and joking around. Every other day (which was basically everyday) I'd get high at school and float on a cloud to my last few classes of the day. And when I finally got home in the afternoon, I'd eat and sleep. Homework was not my thing which is probably why I'm also failing my classes other than skipping classes or being highly in another fucking universe.

The next day. Friday. Finally it was the end of the week. I had a usual morning, thankfully my father was still sleeping when I got up for school, because having him up in the morning before I went to school really kicked my day off with hell. I arrived at school, ready as fuck to spend my day stoned. I smoked right before school and when school started at 8:00 am I found out that today there will be an assembly so my reaction was like "this has got to be hilarious". But when I made it in to the school hall they had told us to drop our bags at the back and have a seat which was not normally what happened. We usually kept our bags with us. But before I could register what was going on, I looked at the stage to see a policeman standing there. Oh shit. Oh fuck no. My entire world stopped and shit went from cloud 9 to sober real fucking quick.
