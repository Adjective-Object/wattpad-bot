What the hell. How is it possible for me to feel like this. The girl has got my head spinning and I kind of like it . It's been about a week since Brittany (BC Jean) has broken up with me and the person that was there for me the most was my best girl friend Witney Carson.She has just gotten out of. A relationship as well and the ironic part is that our exes were cheating on us with each other. When I first found out I was hurt, but after talking about it I feel so much better. My phone then buzzed, it was WitneyWit😝:Hey Mark, up for drinks later?Mark:With who?😮Wit😝: Me, You, Linds, Val, Derek, and Such...... Lol😂I wasn't sure how to respond because of the fact that I had to finish choreographing the routine for Willow and Myself. Mark:Sure why not😀.Wit😝:Kay.👏👏
Thanks for reading I will try and update frequently-Mia😝👯
