Abi,
I'm going to start this out simple.
First of all, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not being there. I was gone for months with no explanation and that was my biggest mistake because that was when I lost you the first time. I was so lucky to get you back. But I didn't learn and I got  myself in trouble and couldn't explain. And that's when I lost you recently. For good. But Abi, there are so many things I want. Need to say but have no way to. I have no words.
I still love you. Those words are all that come out when I try, along with the words I miss you. I miss you Abi. I'm so so so sorry. If I could I would go back in time and fix it. Change it. I wouldn't get in stupid fights and get my shit taken away. I would hold you longer. Call you more often.
Your voice I'd so soft and sweet with your power to still make it fierce. Your beautiful. Gorgeous. Adorable. Silly. Fierce. And loving.
And I shouldn't be saying anything,I know. But I want you too know how much I love you. How much I miss you. I've tried to move on but I can't. I just... I'm in love with you.
Okay I'll stop being stupid and I'll stop blabbering
But know,
When you find someone, if they don't realise how perfect you are. If they don't treat you like a diamonds in the rough. If they aren't there for you like I wasn't. You don't deserve them. You deserve so much more than I can give you. You deserve more than diamonds. More than jewels. More than a Fucking unicorn. You deserve someone who truly loved you and can be there to care and support you through everything. Think and thin.
I'm sorry I wasn't there. And i wish I had been. Because that, leaving you, was by far...my biggest mistake.
I. I don't know what else to say.  So I'll finish this of
Sincerely, Brad.
