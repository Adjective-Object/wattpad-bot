Daisy, be careful.
They may look cute,
They may seem kind,
But they’ll make you go out of your mind.
They will use their charm and sweet,
Give in and you’re dead meat,
Don’t fall for their tricks.
Their gorgeous eyes and amazing smiles
Dorky-cute and great styles.
Run, because once they want you there in no escaping.
Adorable at first but they can break you
You're safe for now.
Be careful, Daisy.
