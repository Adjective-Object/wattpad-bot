Leonard Snart scowled as he watched Star Labs, hoping for some sign of the cocky kid scientist that had stopped him before he could finish off the Flash. If this kid had made the Cold Gun in the first place, he could make them bigger and better. For now, Cisco Ramon was a free man, at least until they got their hands on him anyways. He checked his radio, hitting the call button. "Anything Mick?"
Mick Rory responded a moment later from his post watching the police station. "Nothing. You sure about this?"
"Positive," replied Snart, "The news article says this CSI, Barry Allen, was struck by lightning after the Particle Accelerator explosion and Star Labs helped him pull through. He still visits there almost constantly. If we grab him, our scientist will come after him."
"He works for the police though. Isn't that a big risk?"
Snart snorted. "We're criminals, Mick. The risks aren't that big anymore, only more interesting." He smiled to himself. "And more fun..."

Barry just finished with his work in the lab when Marina came up and knocked on the door. "Hey, Marina... What can I Do for you?"
"I'm just heading to lunch. Thought I'd ask you to join me." Marina noted the paper bag lunch on Barry's desk. "You can save that for tomorrow."
"Yeah... Sure, I'd love to. Need to get fresh air anyways," said Barry nervously as he shoved his lunch into his bag,Â  "Was there somewhere you had in mind?"
"Bart's on 3rd Street has lunch specials." Marina shrugged. "Otherwise, no clue."
"Sounds good, " said Barry. He shouldered his bag and followed the CSI out. "Did you want to walk or..."
"Walking's good. It's only a few blocks. You're in shape anyways so." Marina grinned and Barry forced one in return. "... you're nervous . Why?"
"You never want to have lunch with me," said Barry, "You want to talk about something. Should I be worried?"
Marina laughed. "No, Allen, it's nothing to worry about. Honest."
Barry relaxed slightly. "Ok. Got It. Cool."
Joe waved to the two. "Heading out to lunch, you two?"
"Yup, is that ok?" asked Barry.
"It's fine. Just bring me back something. Someone has to hold the fort while you two are out..." Joe smiled at the duo and headed up the stairs past them. "Have fun!"
Barry shot a panicked look at Joe's back, but followed Marina down the rest of the steps. Somehow, the foreboding feeling about this venture just kept getting worse.

Mick's voice blaring out of the radio scared the crap out of Snart who had just managed to get comfortable again. "The runt cop is leaving the precinct on foot."
Snart immediately sat straight up in his seat. "Is there anyone with him?"
"Just another CSI, a girl one. She works for the police department as well."
"Good. Follow them to wherever they go and wait for me. If were lucky, we get to kill the girl and make sure they all know we mean business." Snart grinned as he hung up his radio. Finally. Action.
