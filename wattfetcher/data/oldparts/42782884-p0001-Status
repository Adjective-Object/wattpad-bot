I'm falling for a girl I can never have, but being able to hold her and cuddle, is worth it. I love seeing her smile, her laugh, I just love everything about her. She is herself and doesn't change anything about herself because of what others think. She makes me laugh and I can have a real honest conversation with her. She's the girl I've waited for; I'll just have to wait a little longer. As long as she is happy, I will be happy. ~C.x
