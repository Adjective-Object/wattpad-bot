Tonight must be the most I have ever been so terribly stressed out. Usually, I can work through it. Tomorrow I will begin my first day at the University of Music & Arts in Mayflower, Washington. First of all, I have lived my entire life in Pennsylvania. I've only just moved here 3 days ago. My parents dropped me off with a kiss and goodbye. Second of all, my whole life is back in Philly. My friends, my family, my dog Jupiter, all of them aren't here. But I am. I was so excited to come here and have this new experience and here I am scared out of my mind and, oh my god, my hands are shaking. Stop it Cleo! I'm driving myself crazy. I suddenly jerk at the vibrating on my desk. Piper is calling me.
"Hello?" That might have sounded sharper and angrier than I intended.
"Damn, Cleo."
"Sorry, it's just-" She stopped me there.
"Look, just calm down. This is exactly why I called." Her laugh trailing behind her last words. Just hearing her voice made me feel so much better, she knew me so well. "Breathe and remember that you are in Washington to pursue your dreams. New experiences are a great thing and can lead to something better. Plus, cute grungy boys."
I bursted out laughing at her last comment. "Piper, just because Kurt Cobain is from this state does not mean every guy will be like him."
"Well, whatever! You know what I mean."
We laughed back and forth for a while and she assured me that everything would be okay. As my nerves eased out, she told me to call her tomorrow with details on my first day. After hanging up, I made certain all of my school supplies were prepared. Then, I brushed my teeth and threw on a loose t-shirt. I don't know if it's because of the mental hell I put myself through or it really is this soft, but I'm loving my dorm room bed.
