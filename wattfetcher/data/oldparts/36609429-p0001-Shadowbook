Carpe Noctem"Seize the Night"☽
For those of you who don’t know me, you should first understand that I like an easy life, which I do not have. Life is horrible, being a foster kid in a harsh world. My last home was terrible. I couldn’t step out of line or even breath wrong without threat of a punishment. Word to the wise; never keep the piece with violence. The one before that was dull and restrictive. I’ve had to follow every rule and broken every rule I could break. Parents sent me back to the shelter after about a week, saying that I was “difficult” and “non-conforming”. This new home isn’t much better. I have a foster brother that bullies me. My life is prison.         “Cinderella” was my favorite fairy tale as a little kid. I’m sure it’s obvious why. As a child I would dream that a handsome prince would come and rescue me from my terrible new parents and take me away with him to live in his palace. But I know better now. I decided to change my existence on my own, as much as I could. Recently, I discovered a new concept, one that seemed to liberate me.           My real name is Alexandra Wilson, but I’d like you to call me Nyx, at least while I’m in Shadow form. I’m thirteen. In these more-than-likely ink-splotched pages, I will tell you Part One of my complex “dream” story. Whether it’s true or not, you’ll have to decide for yourself.
