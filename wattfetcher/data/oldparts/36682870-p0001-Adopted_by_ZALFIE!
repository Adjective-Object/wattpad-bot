"Hi Georgia" I heard a familliar voice say. It was 7:00amOn a Saturday and my twin-Geraldine-had woke me up.
I can't believe we are identical even though we where both girls. This type of thing reminds me of Zoella and ThatcherJoe. Well of course I would be Zoe and Geraldine would be Joe the practical joker. She did this often, so even though it was annoying I was used to it!
"Stop daydreaming and get up" she shouted
"why should I?"
"Because we may be getting adopted!"
"Is this a joke?"
"No." she did sound serious but she was good at that. She usually scared me with her 'angry ' voice. I was ten and, of course, my twin was as well "Get dressed we're going to a fancy restaurant!" I got in my pink boots, my pink and white dress, a bow necklace, a pink lipgloss and a shimer pink eyeshadow. I couldn't believe this was finally happening...
