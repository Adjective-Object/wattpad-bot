"All right, everybody!" Percy yelled. "Who put that marshmallow in my hair? Annabeth?" he said, looking pointedly at her.
Annabeth laughed and hid the plate of toasted marshmallows behind her back. Jason had recently found his newest hobbyâ€”providing electrically-roasted marshmallows to be thrown at everyone. Hazel was using the Mist to make butterflies flutter around Nico's head. Frank was turing into different animals, freaking the heck out of everybody. Piper was throwing smores at everyone from behind trees (maybe to make up for her lost cornucopia?). And Reyna was helping Piper, using Arum and Arguntum to steal the smore ingredients.
Annabeth yelled, "Okay, okay, truce!" as Percy had just stuck some melted chocolate to the back of her shirt. Everyone gathered around the makeshift bonfire/campfire and sat down, attempting to remove the sticky remains of the foodfight from their clothes. Suddenly, Piper stopped smiling. Everybody took one look at her and knew what she was thinking. Man, Leo would've loved this.
"Yeah," Frank said. "He really would've." All of the remaining Seven, plus Nico and Reyna, hoped that wherever Leo was, he was happy.
Reyna asked, "I wonder what crazy contraption Leo would ave built for the marshmallow fight?"
"Probably some crazy gun thing that roasted the marshmallows as they shot out," Jason said.
"Or maybe, I don't know, some slingshot thing that shots out gobs of Rice Crispy Treats at everyone," Nico said.
"All I know is that it would have been amazing," Hazel said wistfully.
