I was sitting on a table on my phone.All of a sudden one of my workers Keyonna comes walking in mad holding money."Wassup?" I asked her and she placed the money in my hand.
"Lola is playing with our money" she said and I started counting the money."Bring that bitch in" I said angry.
This the same girl that keeps playing with our money.I let her slide twice now it's over for her.
Keyonna had Lola by the arm pushing her toward me.I got off the table and grabbed her face making her look at me.
She had tears running down her cheeks.
"Lola where's the rest of my money?" I said calm."I-I don't have it" she said.I took a deep breathe in and out.
"Lola this the second time What I told you was gonna happen next if you don't got it?" I said and she started crying more.
"Times up" I said pulling my gun out hitting her upside her head with it.She hit the ground crying more.
She had blood on the side of her head.
I placed the gun on her temple with no remorse for what I was about to do."Don't play with my money" I said shooting her.

I laid in bed and heard a loud noise coming from downstairs.I got up running downstairs to see the place all messy with my mother laying down."Mommy you okay?" I asked helping her up from the floor.
I could smell alcohol  on her breath.She nodded and looked at me angry.Just then she slapped me in the face.I held my face in pain wanting to cry but didn't cause I didn't want her to see me cry.
"Clean this place up!" She yelled at me as she walked the front door slamming it leaving me.I stood up wiping my tear and started cleaning.
I hate how I'm always being treated.She always brings some guy home then the night end up with them fighting and me left to clean up the mess.
Once I finished cleaning.I did my hygiene stuff and put on my pajamas.I laid in bed and started thinking about life.
All I want is to be loved.
