Everyone introduced their selves. I saw Mike giving his sister a thumbs up for 'Good Job!'. I smiled lightly.Even I introduced myself. Don't know why. Usually I sit and refuse to speak that much information. I stay mysterious, just like what great great grandfather said.
Never tell out personal information to people you don't really trust. Stay occupied with much work possible, and get a good reputation. But do not tell them your personal information.
My parents were off to another country, I'm guessing it was somewhere in England.
We didn't really do much for the first period. I expected more to it though.As we walked out of class, I saw the shy girl sitting by herself.
I walked towards her. "Ummm... Hi, Raynie."
She looked up, and smiled lightly. "Hello."
"Why are you here by your self?"
"Mike told me to stay here. I'm not sure why, but I'm having the slightest feeling he's hanging out with Harry."
"Oh. That guy.", I said, rolling my eyes. I sat next to her. "Say, you are a very good speaker. But... You should speak up. I barely heard you."
"R-really? I'm sorry! I just really- I can't speak too loud in front of an audience."
"Well, at least I can hear you."
"Watch out!!!"
