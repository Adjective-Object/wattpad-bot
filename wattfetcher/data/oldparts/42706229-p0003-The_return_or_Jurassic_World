"Well, okay... very brave.. good." He said and motioned us over.
"Up there-" He said pointing up looking out of the glass up at a very high bridge that wrapped around the whole top of the huge containment.
"-that is where y'all will train her. Now she is 15 feet tall, she couldn't even jump to reach you, which i'm not even sure she can jump but, not taking chances. She weighs six tons, and is forty feet long. Follow me." We follow him over to a panel with buttons and such.
He pulled a lever back and pointed over to a small gate as a sheep walked out of it and he raise the lever back and the gate shut.
"That's how she gets fed. One minute and she will come." I looked over seeing movement of tree's and she then appeared and we all three took a step back from the glass startled and closed our eye's as she gobbled up her meal.
She is massive!
"Now, up to how you'll train her.. calm her.. settle her or whatever is up to you. Be very careful and do not and i mean do not step foot in the containment on the ground. You stay in here or up there. That is all. Now get to work ladies." Was all he said and left.
"What the hell does he want us to teach her? How to do a back flip or roll over?" Lillian snaps causing me and Olivia to chuckle.
This is gonna be hard not to die.
