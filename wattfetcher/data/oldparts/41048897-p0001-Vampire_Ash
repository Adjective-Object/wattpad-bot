Hey! Sooo... My new story! Ash is a lone wolf vampiress (no, she's not a real wolf, and that's what you call female vampires) The above picture is what Ash is wearing for this chapter. (She's thirteen when she's changed, btw... This is 13 year-old Ash, next chapter she's 17.) ENJOY!___________________________________________________________________________
13 YEAR-OLD ASH'S POV
I pull up the hood of my hoodie, and keep walking through the alleyway. I'm in what my family calls the "crime side" of town. I have a knife in my pocket that I just bought. I live on the bad side of New York City, so I'm always prepared. We don't have a car, because this is New York, where traffic is impossibly thick- especially at night -. I continue my walk home. Most cities would be freaking out at just the thought of a 13-year-old girl walking the "crime side" of town alone at midnight, but not ours. This is normal.
I am about three blocks from my apartment when I see a shadow in my periphery. I get out my knife, and hold it in front of me. I feel a sharp pain in my neck. I scream, because the pain is excruciating. The figure is standing over me, looking at me with amusement. I can see the figure more closely now. It's a tall man with black hair and red eyes.
I continue to scream, and he puts something over my mouth. I eventually pass out from the pain.
<<<<<<<<<< Time Skip two weeks later >>>>>>>>>>
I look into the mirror, yet again to see red eyes staring back at me. The man came to me on my walk last night, and said that I was halfway through the process of becoming a vampire. I don't know why, but I believed him. I am considerably faster, and my skin is paler. My heart rate has slowed, and I don't need to breath as much. It's all here. All of the signs. Also, my skin is colder to the touch.
I shake my head, and go back to bed.
>>>>>>>>>>Two weeks later/ end of transformation<<<<<<<<<<<<
I scream again, and feel it- two sharp needle-pointed fangs pushing through my gums. I bring my finger to the tip of them, and they feel like knives. They're as sharp as knives too. "Ashley dear, why were you screaming?" My mom asks from the next room. "No reason!" I yell back, and get up. I walk outside, and run as fast as I can. In about ten minutes, I have reached the city line. I run back home. On my way, I smell something warm, sticky, and sweet.
Blood. I smell blood. I run towards it, and find the source. It's a man, in his late thirties. I sneak up behind him, and quickly snap his neck, so he doesn't feel pain. I smile, and drink every last drop.
After my dinner, I go home. _____________________________________________________________________________
Tada! The first chapter. Next chapter Ash will be 17. C'ya!
