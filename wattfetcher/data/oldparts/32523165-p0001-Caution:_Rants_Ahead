Hello guys. It is Kaitlyn Peace （≧∇≦）here and I have decided to make a rants book.
This is going to be in the randomness section I guess, but here is how this is going to work:
• I will take requests from my readers.
• I will also do my own rants.
• I  will post 1-3* times a week since there is no real story here.
• Now don't kill me-- just because you request, doesn't mean I will make a rant! *Jesus Christ some peoples kids...* SARCASM.
• It may be a little... umm how do I say this... triggering? *walks away* John, was that the right word on the script? Cool. *walks back* Sorry, so some topics may be offensive and/or triggering to some readers. Read at your own discretion.
• I may view things a little different than people around here in this small community i have, so feel free to comment what you think, just be goddamn nICE! *john calls* WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT NO SWEARING? *runs over to john* YOU'RE JUST A STUPID SCRIPT GUY, SHUTTTTT UUUPP!
Thank you for your undivided attention. I am sorry for wasting about 5 minutes of your life. I wasted more writing this piece of poop. Bye!
