"So, why haven't I seen you around?" I asked, we almost never got new costumers.
"Oh...ummm?" he responded, unsure of what to say.
"I think you should just tell him." Zayn said reassuringly.
"Okay, well, ummm, first things first I'm gay." he said, looking at me for a response. my heart lit up. and I smiled and nodded. he seemed less tense after this. "my parents are really rich and extremely religious. they said that they still love me but they don't want to spend an eternity in hell fire because they associate themselves with me so they put like 50 million in my bank account and shipped me to the other side of London." He finished.
"Huh." I replied, thinking about what he just told me.
"What's wrong?" he asked, worried that I wouldn't like him anymore.
"My parents didn't even give me a dollar." I said, looking at him and watching as his expression saddened.
"They kicked you out? Do you have anywhere to live?" Harry/Louis asked.
"Ya, I'm fine." I lied.
"Oh, okay. If you need anything though," Niall said sincerely.
"It's fine." I said glancing at my watch. "I need to get going, I have boxing in twenty minutes." standing up, I downed the rest of my coffee and threw it in the trash.
"I'll see you around!" I called, walking out the door. I didn't know how long it would be until I saw them again but I hope it's soon.
