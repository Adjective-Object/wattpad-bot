"It's so nice to finally meet you, Grace!" Her happiness was tiring me out already and I began to wonder if it was put on. I've never met someone as preppy as her, surely it can't be real.
"Theresa leave her be, she's probably tired." My dad saved me from the bone crushing hug she was giving me, and I almost thanked him but held it in. She led me inside with my dad walking behind us carrying the only two suitcases I'd brought. By the time we'd gotten to my room I was pretty much gasping for breath, with it being on the fourth floor of the house which meant a shit load of stairs to climb everyday, however the entire floor was mine. I had a bedroom, bathroom and lounge room that was decorated pretty well actually.
"Do you like it? We did it all neutral so you can add whatever you want, we just want you to be comfortable." I recognized the look she was giving me, it was a look I had gotten a lot this past month. Sympathy. It sickened me, especially coming from her.
"It's nice." I say, grabbing the suitcases from my dad to take into the room I would be sleeping in. There was a huge balcony on one side, that seemed to have stairs leading down to the balcony on the floor below, it also had three huge windows on the side opposite that were decorated with sickly floral patterns that looked a lot like what my grandmother used to own, the bed was huge and the carpet was soft, which was a bonus. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make it feel like my new home.
