"It's all on Hayden?" they asked together.
"Yup," I smirked. "better bring, like, twenty bucks after school, then,"
"Yo, c'mon. I asked you only," Hayden frowned.
"Uh, let's do this. You pay for me, 'cause I spent all my savings on chocolate bars. And Drew'll pay for everyone else," I said, grinning cheekily at Drew, who scowled immediately at the mention of him paying for four other people.
"No fucking way," he announced, glaring pointedly at me. "I'm not going if it's gonna be like that,"
"Calm your man tits, Drew," Claire laughed. "we'll all just pay for ourselves,"
"Wait, so no free food?" Thomas frowned.
"The fuck, Thomas. Just bring two bucks," Hayden said, eyeing his friend weirdly.
"I thought we all had something special," Danny sighed dramatically, and I grinned.
"You all are such drama queen's," I rolled my eyes. "spending two bucks isn't so hard,"
"Whatever," Drew threw his hands up in defeat. "I'll just bring ten bucks. It's all on me,"
"Since when did you become so nice?" Sierra raised an eyebrow, speaking for the first time in a while.
"Since I found out you had AID's and decided to feel pity," Drew shot back, and I snickered.
"You're supposed to be defending me, Lex!" Sierra complained, her eyes darting from me to Drew, and then Hayden. Her eyes were filled with different emotions. Jealousy, anger, and hurt. Now I could explain exactly why she was feeling all that, too. Jealousy 'cause I had two of the cutest guys beside me, anger that none were paying attention to her, and hurt because her crush just dissed her. I would not wanna be in her place.
