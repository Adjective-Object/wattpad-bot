I got in my car and drove off.
...
Niall POV.
"Lauryn! Come out", I laughed.
Were hiding seek and she's so good at it.
"Papa is home!" I lied.
"Papa!" she screamed.
"Gotcha!" I laughed and picked her up.
"Again" she smiled showing her dipples.
"Tomorrow. Its bath time" I kissed her head.
"Good, I stink!" she wrinkled her nose. I laughed and sat her down on the toilet as I ran the water.
"Daddy, help me" she said. I turned around to pull off her shirt.
After undressing Lauryn I heard the door open.
"Is that papa? I want him" Lauryn pouted.
"I don't know babe" I sighed. I washed her up than dried her.
I brushed out her hair letting it down.
"Ow! I got it" she glared.
"Okay, Miss. Mean" I laughed, "Come on. Bedtime".
...
I put on some shorts and entered my bedroom. Surprised I see Harry on the bed asleep.
"Really" I sighed. Made my way to the bed turning off the light and laid down.
"Niall?" Harry turned around wrapping his arm around me.
"Yeah?" I looked at him.
"You okay?" he asked.
"Super fine" I smiled.
"Good" he smiled,"Was Lauryn good?".
"She cried for an hour because you left" I sighed and scooted close to Harry.
"I'll make it up to her" he sighed, "But I wanna do something".
"That is" I asked confused.
With no answer Harry climbed on top of me putting half his weight on me. I laughed but kissed him.
"I missed you deeply" Harry smirked.
"I missed you too" I smiled.
"So let's make up it" he smiled.
"Lauryn..." I stopped.
"I'll cover your mouth" Harry said and without an answer from me, things got heated.
