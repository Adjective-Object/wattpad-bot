He was wasting his energy, all the anger I caused making him weak. His powers slowly disintegrating as thunder roared in my ears, my hair whipping in my face as I tried to see through the pouring rain. "Don't come any closer, Blaire!" Harry shouted, palms now covering his face, "I can't control what I'll do to you!"
I didn't listen, I never do and that's what got me in this mess in the first place. "Harry, I have an explanation!" I said, crouching next to him as his head snapped in my direction, eyes narrowed as he rapidly stood up.
The raging storm thrashing throughout the sky, branches from trees snapping, windows from houses jostling in agony, lightning bolting across the clouds, thunder crackling obnoxiously as I tried to shout over it.
"I don't want to hear it! Don't you understand?" Harry interrupted, taking a step back, trying to lose contact with me. "You ruined everything, We're finished for! There's nothing you can say to make this any better!" Harry screamed at me, his hand now gripping the collar of my t-shirt.
My face inches from his, Harry's breath fanning over my lips as I whined in horror. Tears streaming down my cheeks as I looked away from him. His lips whispering in my ear, my body shaking as he said, "Now, leave me alone." And with that, he let go, dropping me to the floor and facing away.
His strides long and fast as he left me. Hands tugging into the pockets of his jeans, his hair whipping in the wind as the storm followed behind him.
The rain pattered against my skin as I sobbed, shaking my head. I lost everything.
A/N
As most of you know, I finished this story! It was one of my prime goals and I'm very happy that I achieved it! Anyways, I want to say thank you for reading this and for supporting me if you're an upcoming reader, but this book is going under some major editing! I'm sad to say that "Storm," wasn't my best work! I was in such a rush to end the story that I didn't realize how messy it turned out to be and how much I didn't love it! So, please know that I'm editing the fanfiction and hopefully it will be better for you all! Lots of love xx
(Keep "Storm,"  in your library if you want to read it! I'll be publishing chapter by chapter on here once they're done being edited by me! xx)
