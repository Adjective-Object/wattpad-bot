My Love, With your beautiful eyes, beautiful smile,With such beautiful hair, The way you get that funny look when you don't understand, Or when you complain about a strand of your hair that flys in your face,I love it all, I wouldn't change you for the world, The way you feel in my arms, The way you smile cutely at me,It hurts darlin' when you belittle your beauty, So I kiss your cheek and hold your hand, While softly telling you are beautiful as you currently are, You smile brightly and thank me while kissing my cheek, I laugh and then awaken with a jolt, I stare at the ceiling, Emotionless, Alone, The whole thing just a sick wish my heart makes, A wish that will never be fulfilled, I hear a ding and see I have a message from you, You tell me about your date with your lover,I laugh and laugh while tears stream from my eyes, You will never be mine, But as long as your happy, And as long I have you by my side, I'll be happy, I'll never give up though, I'll stay with the hope that one day, Hopefully one day soon, You'll look at me like I look at you.
