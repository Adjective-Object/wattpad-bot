So... Hey.
I'm really bad at these introductory things, so, I'm afraid to say that this is the best I got at the moment. Yeah, I know- it's not great... Butttt.... eh. Moving onwards...

I don't really have much of a plan for this book, so I'm kind of just making it up as I go along, jotting down ideas and writing them in.
That means I also don't have an update schedule for this. (I have such poor planning skills Dx) But, you want to know what I think?
I don't care, I'll tell you anyway.
I think that the more time and effort you put in to something and the longer you take doing it, the better it will be in the long run~ (That is some insparatio right there.)
I also have a minimum to maximum word count for each chapter which is 1000-2500 words. Anything below will be worked on, improved - anything above will be trimmed and simplified.

Another thing, I really desperately need an editor- just to help me go through things.
And anyone who would be willing to make a cover better than the one I have now - that would also be greatly appreciated. :)

Thank you for taking time to read my book, it means alot. <3
Please don't forget to Vote and Comment for each chapter, it really helps me improve my work.
Following me might prove nicer than expected too, eh? ;)
(Haha, you don't have to if you don't want to xD)
