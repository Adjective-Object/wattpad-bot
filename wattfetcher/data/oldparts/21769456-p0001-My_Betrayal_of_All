NOTE! I DONT OWN THESE CHARACTERS! THEY BELONG TO RICK RIORDAN! Please enjoy my mockery of some of the boys (including Leo) and the change up of the chaos stories and just using the girls this time. Note, I will be very slow about putting up new parts until I have fifteen reads and five comments (from different people) and five stars. Enjoy!
Annabeth POV
I took by sword, Betrayal, and parried Catherine. We are pretty evenly matched usually but today she was distracted, most of us were. I quickly disarmed her and she sat down beside the water jug. I put our weapons back on rack and sat down beside her. Catherine, or her old name Calypso, sighed.
"Why does this day always hurt so much? Why can't it just be another day?" She brings her head back against the wall sighing again.
I sigh as well. This day is never easy for any of the maiden team except angel, who didn't have the problem of boys. There are many of us though we didn't all end up this way but most of us just got lead down the wrong path. Out of all of us mine, was the worst.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~flashback~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As head architect of Olympus my job was never done. The gods kept wanting new things and I would make their wishes come true. I had just finished up with remodelling Aphrodite's throne for the tenth time this month and was heading back to camp bursting with excitement of my date with my seaweed brain. Thanks to Hermes I got there in record time. I head down to the dinning area and can hear laughter and the crackle of the fire. I sit down at the Athena table and all of my cabin mates swarm me with questions. I try my best to answer all of them but as I look through the flurry of Athena children I can see Percy and what I see shocks me. My seaweed head is sitting there, gazing at a girl across the hall. I look in that direction and see a group of new campers. I groan and try to ignore him and my cabin mates but struggle throughout the whole meal.
Soon after dinner I corner the dazed Percy in the woods.
"What's the dazed look all about seaweed brain?" He whips around startled.
"Annabeth? What are you doing back so soon? He looks around nervously.
"Hermes gave me a hand with Aphrodite's throne." I cross my arms and stare at him wishing what I saw wasn't true. "What was up at dinner? You seemed so....distracted." His eyes widen. Bingo, I hit him straight on.
"Oh! Just...just wondering if the new Aphrodite kids were doing okay! Ya, that's it." He look up trying to be truthful but completely failed.
"New kids huh seaweed brains. Then why don't you introduce me?" I smile trying to make it like I maybe believe him a bit.
"Sure! Let's do. That. Now!" He then starts running off to the cabins.
As we arrive we're greeted by Piper, and by the looks of it these girls are pretty tough. I walk beside Piper to come face to face with five Aphrodite children, each of them similar to me and my friends.
"Annabeth, I want you to meet Natalie, Georgie, Alison, Helen, Jane and Stacey. Girls, this is Annabeth, head of the Athena cabin, head architect of Olympus." Percy introduces him but I can tell his eyes seem to keep going back to Natalie.
"So, this is the smarty of the camp. There always seems to be one wherever you go, you just can't escape them!" Natalie mocks and a chorus of little giggles escape from the other girls.
"Look here Natalie. I've been on many quests, met Daleus and beaten Gaia and could beat your behind or whatever it is any day." I shoot back and hear a stiffled laugh come from Piper.
"Well then, why don't we settle that then? How about the sword arena tomorrow at ten? Will that work for you little miss perfect?" Natalie sneers.
