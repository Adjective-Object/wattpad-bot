(Ciara with the black hair and Niki with the blonde hair)
Wassup! My name Ciara Monroe, my street name is Cici.. I'm 17, I dropped outta high school before my senior year because I needed to take care of my family. My family is my 2 little sisters and my grandmother. Our dad is dead, our mom is in rehab, and our older brother doesn't live in Cali with us; he moved to New York when he turnt 23.
I'm part of this gang called '2Sl1ck'. There are 5 main members, well 6 counting me. There is Trigga (18), Killa (20), Rabbit(16), Roman(18), Niki(17), and me; Cici (4 boys, 2 girls). Niki is my best friend, A1 day1, partner in crime, same with Trigga. Killa, Rabbit, and Roman are like brothers to me, so basically a hoe should be warned about messing with them the wrong way.
People say I should be more nice, cause I say a lot of rude things to people most of the time. It's because I'm hot-headed, a neurotic person, and I'm kind of bipolar. I do take pills that actually keep me sober from freaking out, blacking out, pulling my hair, or biting my nails.
Life is hard for me man. The struggles.
