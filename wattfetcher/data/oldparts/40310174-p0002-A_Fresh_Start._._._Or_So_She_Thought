I tried telling my father about the torture that happens to me in school. He told me to stop acting like such a baby and for me to grow up and learn that things like these happen to everyone. I guess everyone loses a piece of themselves when a loved one passes away. I lost some of my novelty, and I guess he lost some of his humanity.
On my walk to school I passed a few things. A giant tree towering over me, with leaves still green even though the trees around it are bare and dry looking. It still blossomed under the circumstances it was in. I passed a boy and a girl in a car, singing along to a popular song, laughing at each other's terrifying singing skills. And a young woman, obviously expecting a baby, taking a walk with her partner. Boyfriend or husband, I don't know.
She waved and smiled at me, and I gave a small smile back. It feels like the world just loves virtually giving out happiness to everything that basically moves.
Except for me. I got close the building marked, WOODLAND HIGH SCHOOL. It should be called place of despair, shame, and torment. I slipped through the enormous front doors, and looked around. I sighed a breath of relief. Just as I thought I was alone, a pair of big strong hands cover my eyes and wrap around my neck. I struggled against them but my attempts were futile.
"Though you were alone you little bitch? You thought wrong Rae Ann!" Reed Warren said, pulling me into one of the hallways.
"Let me go Reed!" I cried, desperate.
"You think you can get away that easy?" Reed said in a harsh tone, dragging me to the end of the hallway, covering my mouth so I couldn't speak. Finally, he threw me to the ground, and I started coughing from the way he was pulling my neck.
"I think it's fun seeing little skanks like you try and beg for mercy," He said, staring at me with those cold, dark blue eyes. Does nobody come to school or do the teachers all think it's entertaining to stay in their classrooms and block out all noises?Reed frowned, and looked down on me with a spiritless expression.
"Aren't you going to cry?" Reed questioned. I didn't respond. Responding would probably make things worse. Instead I just looked at the ground.
"Fine, if you won't cry now, you'll cry later," Reed threatened and walked straight down the hallway. Knowing Reed was out of sight, I let the tears roll freely down my cheeks. It was so unreasonable as to why he always had to pick on me and make me feel like trash for no reason. I never did anything to him.
But maybe it is my fault. Maybe I'm just way too different to have friends. Maybe my personality just isn't the same. If I was perfect he wouldn't make me suffer like this. I wish I was just like anyone else.
The rest of my day droned on. I got a D on my science test and an F on my algebra test. I was just too distracted in class by all my bad thoughts and all my grieving for my mother. It's not like I'll need a ninth grade algebra for the rest of my life anyway.
At lunch I ate in the library, because I wouldn't be allowed to sit anywhere without all the other people moving to another table.
In my creative writing class I did get an A on my project. This was the only class I enjoyed. I enjoyed getting to write down all my thoughts and feelings and it also benefits my GPA. Although in my English class Reed somehow got the whole class to make fun of me when I couldn't pronounce one of the vocabulary words correctly.
In my gym class we had to play a demonic version of dodgeball where there were no sides and we could only identify teams by a little red or blue belt. Reed and I were on the same team but he got some of his friends on the other team to pelt me with kick balls. One hit me so hard it bruised my nose.
