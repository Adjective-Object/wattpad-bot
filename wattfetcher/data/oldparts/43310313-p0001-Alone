HI GUYS!!
So I deleted my last fanfic because I didn't really like the way it was going and I thought it was kinda stupid. So I'm starting this new one and you may think "the title has nothing to do with it" but it's how she's feeling.
This new fanfic will have most of the same characters but they'll be different of course.
The "main character" (IDEK it changes pov from time to time but she's one of the main character's)  her name is Lannah like the other fanfic but she's Calum's little sister and she was adopted when she was younger.
She thinks that nobody really notices her or pays attention except for her brother so she feels like she's kind of just there. That is why the story is called "Alone" and as you can see I have a thing for smoke.
Anyway I swear I'll try to make the story enjoyable and the first chapter should be up tonight or tomorrow :-) thanks for reading guys. Sorry if you wanted to know what happened with the last one I just wasn't into it. -Lannah (oh what a coincidence I have the same name as the "main character")
