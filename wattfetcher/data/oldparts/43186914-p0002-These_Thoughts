I wake up the next night and I'm in a hospital bed. It's dark, I look down at my body and I'm covered in red bandages. I look around and my eyes stop on a person beside my bed. Ashlee is sleeping on a cot beside me. My hand in hers. She looks so peaceful. Then I look in my other hand, there's a note. I open it slowly and it reads;
"Dear Christian,
I don't know what made you do this to yourself but all I can say is that I'm sorry. I sorry I wasn't there when you needed me. I'm sorry that I let this happen... Babe. I saw the gun you had. I knew what your were going to do, but you called me and I came to you before you could do it. That's all that matters right now. I saw the bottle of whiskey. You drank the whole thing. You wanted to drink the pain away... but you should know that it will only bring you more pain...
Look. I'm not writing this so that I can rant to you, I'm writing this so that I can say... I love you. I love you with every single bit of my heart. You are my world. I don't know what I could do without you... You mean so much to me... I don't think I could ever live without you. If you died, I don't know how I could go on. All I'm trying to say is... I love you and I want you to believe that I'll always be there for you. No matter what.
I love you Christian, Ashlee"
I look back over to Ashlee and she comes up and we kiss. Lips liked with each other. And we kissed for what seemed like forever, but it was the best forever I could ever ask for. I love this woman, and I love her no matter what happens. Then we spend the rest of the night, together, hand-in-hand. Together bound by true love.
