"And why would I do that?" I smirked up him. "You're gonna go off and have your wild aventures with your new private school girls, and everyone knows their as easy as the japs in our school!" My stomach became uneasy as I started picturing Mike flirting with those snobby, rich girls with their intricate eyebrow shapes and pools of money. Needless to say I wasn't very pleased about it, I felt super protective about him. He was like ... my brother? No that's not it. I mean usually that's how I would describe him, but that word doesn't seem appropriate now. He frowned and slowly inched his face away from where mine used to be.
"Oh, then I guess this is goodbye. I'm going to miss you Emma." And before I could respond he was out the door and out of my life, once again.

"Mrs. Winston! Pay attention please, this is an AP class and even though this is the firs day I won't have you slacking off!" scram the teacher that I was supposed to be paying attention to. I shook out of the deep thought I was in and decided to jump into the class half way through it, even if I was sufferring my GPA didn't need to be.
"Hi, what the hell is going on with you today?" Whispered Kat from the seat next to me. Kat had been my girl best friend for as long as Mike had, she was the subsequantial third wheel to our Oprah and Gayle. The only difference was that she had known about my obvious crush on Mike. She would always console me whenever he added onto the never ending fuck list he had, and convince me that I was 10 times better than those girls and that the only reason we weren't together was because I never told him how I felt. Katerina was my rock and I was always grateful to her for that.
"I saw him..." I stated back, ominously.
'Him?" She questioned, until a look of utter disbelief replaced her confusion. "You did not! How could you not tell me.. Hello I am supposed to be your best friend here!"
"Oh shut up! It's not like you have spilled the beans about that sexy Italian guy you fucked over the summer. I had to find out from YOUR SISTER!!" I shot back, this summer Kat went to Europe with her twin sister Kathy, which was yet another reason I had been so alone this summer, between her crazy character and Kathy's incredible talent of getting drinks and spliff from any desperate, horny guy... I doubt they had anything but a good time.
"Alright, alright. Guilty. But after all-"
"Ladies you are interrupting my class!" Interjected the teacher again.
"Yeah alright my bad Ms. P" aplogized Kat, followed by her mouthing the words we'll talk about this later.
When the bell finally rung Kat and I walked hurridly over to my car as she spilled all the juic details about her trip. Turns out the one-nighter's name was Francisco, a 6-foot-something Italian god (and that wasn't the only tall thing on him ;). I eagerly listened to her story all the way to her driveway, devouring every last word with an evident jealousy.
"Okay, one I hate you for not bringing me alone, and two how the hell do you bag an Italian hottie and steal a vespa all in one night? You're stories are legendary."
"I know!" Kat exclaimed rolling her eyes in her own profound glory "Next time you're coming for sure, and you can bag your own Italian hottie." We both laughed at the thought of it. God, I had the coolest friends. Just as she was about to get out of the car Kat looked back at me and mentioned, "Hey you never told me what happened with you and Mike, come inside and we'll talk about it."
