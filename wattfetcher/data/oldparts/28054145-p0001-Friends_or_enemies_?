Spencer's POV :
It's been a year since Ali's death. I lay in my bed thinking about her. The memories when Hanna,Aria,Emily,Alison and I would go shopping together, talk about our crushes, but, all of a sudden I stop thinking.

You were keeping me alive, you kept me from feeling depressed, starving myself and cutting. You were the reason why I didn't hate school or my life. He kept apologizing. I pulled my arms away from him. I told him angrily to leave.
I furiously march up the stairs to my bedroom. I think about the day we broke up.
