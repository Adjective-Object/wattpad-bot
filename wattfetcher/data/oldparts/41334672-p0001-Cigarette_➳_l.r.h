Luke was tired and cold, it'd been a long day, to say the least. Although he was wearing a red flannel over his black shirt, he was still cold. He didn't really care though.
At the moment all he cared about was getting to the bus stop in time to catch the last bus of the day, it'd take him to the end of his road.
Luke found himself darting down a back alley, before legging it across a main road onto the other side where he stood at the opening gates of the park. He sighed knowing he had to go through the park and come out the other side to get to the bus stop.
The park wasn't huge, but, it was dimly light and a hot spot for drunks and druggies, and Luke wasn't prepared for it, if they talked to him, or heckled him. He put his head down and speed-walked, he stuck to the path where most of the lights were, although many were broken or smashed, but at least he could see where he was going.
His pace quickened as the exit to the park came into his sight. If he hadn't of stayed at work that extra half an hour trying to chat up a girl he could have walked the long way around, but no, Luke really wanted that girls number.
"Thank god for that." Luke mumbles under his breath stepping onto the concrete outside of the park. He shoves his hands in his pockets looking at the bus stop, a good twenty feet, from where he's stood.
His eyes stop on a girl. Sat on the wall opposite the bus stop, her legs swinging back and fourth bouncing off the concrete. Luke didn't mind girls, he loved them to be perfectly honest, but he isn't in the mood for conversation right now.
He bounced down onto the seat at the bus stop, opposite the girl sat on the five foot high wall. Her eyes looking him up and down before turning her head away.
Luke studied the girl, the only studying he'd done in a while. She was pale and had a small frame, her blonde hair seemed, tangled, almost. She was wearing black skinny jeans, a rip in one knee, a black shirt and black doc marten boots.  A green parka coming half way down her thighs.
"Do you want one?"
Luke blinked a few times at the sudden words, he looked at the girl who was raising an eyebrow at him and holding a pack of cigarettes out towards him.
"What? No!" He shrieks frowning at her, she retracts her hand shoving the packet back into her pocket.
"You, were staring at me so, I just kinda assumed." The girl shrugged her shoulder, a cigarette between her own lips, moving up and down as she talked. Luke watched her as she pulled a black lighter from her jeans pocket setting the end of the cigarette alight.
"Didn't your parents teach you, staring is rude." The girl huffs at Luke blowing a mouthful of smoke in his direction although is disperses before he can inhale anything.
"They did, they also taught me smoking is wrong." He bites back at her pulling the black ring around his lip in between his teeth. The girl simply smirks at him before taking another drag of the burning stick.
Neither of them bother to continue with the conversation, neither really wanted to continue the conversation, Luke's top priority was just to get home as quickly as possible and sleep.
The girl slipped off the wall landing on her feet, she wiggled her foot about in her boots while she took another few drags of her cigarette, Luke simply watched. She exhaled tilting her head back making the white smoke float up into the black sky. She then threw the little bit of it that was left onto the floor before covering it with her foot.
"The bus is here." She grumbled brushing against Luke's shoulder to get on the bus. Luke simply nods his head.
