"Araya wanted Allison, okay? Not me. She wanted Allison" They both watched her intently.
"Obviously...Allison can't actually be here but according to Chris, I'm the next best thing"
Stiles looked at her with a hint of curiosity that quickly turned to the look of betrayal.
"And you didn't think of calling us to tell us you were okay?" He asked. His voice increasing with every syllable.
"But Chris-"
"Since when did you listen to Chris?!" He accused. Lydia put a hand on his arm. Silently telling him off with a glare.
"You're a traitor. Working for these hunters, they have Derek" Stiles said. Asher turned around so she wasn't facing them anymore.
"They don't have Derek," she said curtly. "You guys are wasting your time, if I'm such a traitor, I think it would be better off I was presumed dead"
A/N:THE STASHER TENSION IS REAL.
im going to be adding many scasher and wyatt/asher scenes and maybe, quite possibly an isaac/asher moment, which reminds me, would ya'll suggest some ship names for Wyatt and Asher? That would really help me loads.
But oh yeah! WELCOME TO BOOK NUMERO 2!
Enjoy your stay and maybe, just maybe, I'll write a season 5 book as well. When all the 5a and 5b episodes are released. Its a possibility but idk if u guys will stay around that long of if stalia will ruin everything for everyone.
Speaking of Stalia, prepare for some bitchy Malia scenes. I'm adding on to her character and making her a bitch. You're welcome. But don't worry, it helps the Stasher development so it's all good Malia fans, no need to get defensive.
