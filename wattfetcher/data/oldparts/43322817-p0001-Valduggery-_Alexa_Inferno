It was a normal day for Ghastly, he was sat sewing a new suit for Skulduggery humming to himself, when he smelt fire. He jumped out of his seat and followed the smoke into the back room, and when he opened the door all he could see was smoke, and all he could hear was someone coughing. He cursed and manipulated the water from the air and through it at the flames frantically trying to put them out, before they reach something flammable. As soon as the flames were out he was coughing like mad but he could still hear someone chocking on the smoke so he waved his arms around trying to clear his path, until he saw the person on the floor coughing up blood, so he hurriedly picked her up and ran out of the room. Ghastly placed the girl on the couch and went to open all the windows to let the smoke out.
Once he had finished and the smoke was clear he remembered about the girl and rushed into his living room to see the girl stood up and clothes badly burned aswell as her arms up to her elbows. She had fiery red wavy hair and grey eyes, and her skin was quite pale. Ghastly knew who this was! He gasped when he figured it out "A...Alexa Inferno?" he asked "Hello dad!" Alexa said and started coughing again, and Ghastly rushed forward and hugged her "I thought you were dead!" he said and hugged her tighter when she hissed, so he pulled back "I missed you so much too! But, these burns are really hurting me!" Alexa said and held out her badly burned arms and Ghastly examined them "Um...ok lets get you to Kenspeckle!"
"Ok!" she said cheerfully but when she moved a leg she fell to the floor in pain "OW!" she yelled and Ghastly rushed over and picked her up and carried her to his van and put her in. On the way there she fell asleep and Ghastly sighed happily as he was finally reunited with his daughter after 19 years!
