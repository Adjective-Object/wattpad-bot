"Yeah." Spencer said softly grabbing your arm softly helping you get up and walked you to the other room and sat you down sitting in front of you with a worried look.
"Reid I'm okay don't look so worried" You said with a smile. Spencer has always worried about you, he never let you interrogate unless absolutely needed, he never let you go anywhere without him, Rossi, Hotch, Morgan, or Prentiss. Reid laughed softly as a soft pink brushed over his cheeks. Reid was.... He was blushing, was he embarrassed about you noticing how worried he gets about you?
"It's hard to not worry about someone like you" Spencer said in his hushed voice. You hit his shoulder softly as you chuckled.
"What's that supposed to mean?"  You asked looking at him.
"Well I've known you for a long time, and you are always getting scrapped up or bruised." Spencer got his sentence out finally then looked at you with his awkwardness. You smiled and wrapped your small arms around his shoulders as he hesitated then slipped his arms around your waist awkwardly
"You are such a sweet heart Reid..." You replied softly.
