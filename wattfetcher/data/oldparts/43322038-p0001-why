You're probably not reading that. Whatever. It's in English and there will be lot of faults, and you'd say something like "bad english xD" now. You would do it, I'm sure.
I'm not good with feelings.
I care way too much, react way too bitchy and take things way too seriously.
Yep, you're right.
You're no "bad man", just wanted so say that.
Phew, okay.
I'm still in love with you.
Whew.
That wasn't as difficult to write as I expected.
I'm stalking you, like Instagram and Wattpad, and that's so childish and I know I should let you go and let you live your life without me - but I can't.
- That sounds so egoistic -
I fucking CAN'T. I miss every inch of you, every inch of this 5'7 to 5'8 tall, dark brown haired and brown eyed guy.
I miss EVERYTHING.
On the one hand, I wanna hit you (I'd win, for sure). Hard. On the other hand, I just wanna go back in time and return to 2 weeks ago.
Feelings are so weird, idk.
And this 'yes' is killing me, ok?
I cry every time someone says 'yes' (in German AND in English, pff).
- it's annoying -
Ok, I know this won't help anymore.
Thank you. (You've never said this before, do you?)
Amazing.
YES.
