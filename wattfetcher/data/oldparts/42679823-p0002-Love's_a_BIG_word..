Something was missing from my family. It was like a jigsaw puzzle with one piece missing, it can never be complete. It happened six months ago on March 15th, my birthday. Obviously being my birthday and all you'd expect a party, a cake, laughter and happiness... Not for me. I could feel the tears begin to sting my eyes as I replayed the events in my head, the clash, the scratching, the tumbling, the silence.
I was on my way to the 'surprise party' with my older sister Melissa, she was nineteen, we was laughing and talking as we made our way to the restaurant but a drunken driver had other plans. He was speeding, and ran straight through a red light - it all happened so fast, we couldn't stop. He smashed his car into the side of Melissa's, sending our car tumbling over. I remember it going dark after that, and then waking up in hospital. I was in a coma for three days. Melissa had a head trauma and never woke up from her coma, the doctors said they could keep her on the machines for an extra week but Melissa in the state she was - if she did wake up, she would of had permanent brain damage and wouldn't be a nineteen year old, it would be like having a baby that never learnt how to grow up. I was the lucky one, but i shouldn't have been. Melissa was my best friend, we didn't fight like most siblings, we were so alike it was scary.
As I searched through a box filled with useless items that had no meaning to me what's so ever, I pulled out a silver frame that held a picture of Melissa and I laughing. I felt a salty droplet trickle down my cheek. I placed it on my bedside table, and just sat on my bed staring at the floor. Until I heard my fathers voice calling up to me from downstairs, "Scarlett, come meet our neighbours!" I put on a brave face and stepped out of my bedroom closing the door behind me.
