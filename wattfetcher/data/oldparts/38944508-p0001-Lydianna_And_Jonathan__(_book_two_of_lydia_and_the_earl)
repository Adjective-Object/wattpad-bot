My foster mom Katherine yells from downstairs. She has a son. And me. I sigh and head downstairs . Once we head to school me and nick are quiet the whole time. He heads to his group of friends as soon as we get there. - we walked.-I stand there and look around. A guy walks over to me.'' You lost?'' His face. It's covered by his hoodie. '' uh. No. I'm.'''' You hesitated.''  I smile.'' josh. What are u doing here?'''' Keeping an eye on u. Oh. I heard someone special goes to this school.'''' Not uh.'''' Mhm.'''' Where is he. Shoot.'' I say as I notice nick watching me. '' You have to go. Just. Tell me where he is.'''' Back.'' I nod and he walks away.  I look over at nick smiling as I look over. He smiles a bit but then frowns. He knows somethings up. I just head through The back of the school and once I arrive there no one is there but then I feel a quick breeze behind me. I smile as he touches my was it and kisses my neck.'' Jace.'' I whisper. He laughs a bit and pulls away. I turn around facing towards him. '' Does the leader know?'' He shakes his head. He also wears a hoodie. He looks around and gives me a hoodie.'' He went back to idris. How's ur foster family?'''' The brother. He's not what I expected. He's quiet but curious.

We soon enough head in except once we reach the room we enter slowly. The teacher is a lady. She seems very flexible and she gives us our seats in no time. Once class has started I pay attention. But the girl cheerleader keeps staring at me. I look over at her. She looks away in anger.Once we have two free periods Jace and I walk around until the daughter of jace's family runs towards us.
