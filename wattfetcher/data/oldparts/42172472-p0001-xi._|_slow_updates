The thick humid air filled in the bathroom. Knelt down in the corner of the shower trying to get my mind together I stopped crying. I stopped but I wanted to cry more, I wasn't done and I'm not going to cry later on. The thick air caught up to me making it hard to breathe, but I didn't mind, I didn't mind at all.
3 hours later
The midnight sky soothed me to sleep as a hummed to Ms.Holiday in the background.
Good morning, heartache, here we go againGood morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me whenMight as well get used to you hangin aroundGood morning, heartache, sit d-
ring,ring,ring
outbursted the phone interrupting the song. I looked at it as it rang but finally picked up at the last ring.
"For crying out loud Janet! You can't keep me here waiting for you to pick up the damn phone. Anyways, we've gotta put you back on track. The label is expecting you to come up with another album before the end of this year." Said my manager, Mark.
"I pick my own damn phone when I feel like it and why? I thought I was on break?"
"4 years Janet, 4 fucking years. You've went out into hiding ever since you were done with everything for your last album, the world basucally doesn't even think you exist."
"Well let them think that."
"Ugh, well be by the studio tomorrow by 7."
"7 at night?" I asked with a bit of an attitude.
"Morning."
"Wh-" Mark had hung up before I could even reply. I went back to the balcony where I took in all the dark night sky and stars that tinkle above me. At that moments Sade's Smooth Operator started to play on my cassette full of classics.
No need to ask, he's a smooth operatorSmooth operatorSmooth operatorSmooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago...
I started to think back about Darrell.. Darrell, Darrell, Darrell....
The year of 93', I was topping charts all over the place while Darrell was dropping ki's all over the world. I was his good girl and he was my bad boy, we were inseparable even through the shit he put me through.
We had it all until that night.
Flashback to 95'
"Aww baby, I'm missed you." I cooed as we shared a kissed.
"Yeaaaa, now I can make some babies with my baby."
"Boy bye." I said causing us to laugh.
"Nah but forreal, I missed you too shorty." He said threading the line of kissing into a makeout. We barely left the doorway but at least the door was closed. Darrell had pulled up my dress a bit to slide his hands in but the next thing you knew shattered glasses was every where and Darrell's dead body was collapsed on top of me.
End of Flashback
I found myself drinking shots of Brandy as I re-lived the memory in tears in bed. As time went by, I drowned in my pools of tears to sleep with an empty glass in hand.
