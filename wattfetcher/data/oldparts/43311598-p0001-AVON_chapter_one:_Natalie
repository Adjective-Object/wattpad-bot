As I continued to fall off the 18 story building, I realized I left my hair straightener on.  "God dammit", I whispered to myself, wondering how I'm going to get myself out of this situation and still prevent burning the luxurious hotel that doesn't even have a 13th floor down. Nows not the time for me to think up random facts like that. I heard the screams of people below me while I, surprise, continued falling from an 18 story building and worry about my straightener that could possibly burn the whole thing down.
