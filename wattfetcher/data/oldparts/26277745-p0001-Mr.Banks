Before you read please keep a positive outlook on the book it was my first book. I'm trying to get my writing skills up(not like it got better but gotta stay positive).
So bear with me, there is a lot of grammar and punctuation mistakes(I apologize). Also when you finish this book check out my other works.
DON'T FORGET TO VOTE, COMMENT AND SHARE.
