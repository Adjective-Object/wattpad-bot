" Louis babe open this door you've been in there for way over a hour."" What the heck am I suppose to do come hug you with open arms and just talk through this because haha I think not."" This is just as much your fault as it is mine. I'm 19 years old what am I suppose to do without your help.""feryn get out of my house. I don't want to see you again. I never wanted kids. I was drunk you were drunk so it wasn't my fault."
- present day- 3 years later"mommy why are you crying." little Mckenzi Ray asked. " nothing baby go get ready for school and tell your brother too also." I know I just lied to my 4 year old but how am I suppose to tell her I was crying because of her dad she has no idea about."Mckenzi, Beckett are you ready for school?" " mommy mommy I can't find my shoes I can't find them anywhere." Beckett Ryan cried. ugh just like his father losing everything all at once. " Beckett honey they are by the front door where you put them yesturday." " guys come on we will be late and you know how long it takes us to walk to school." I walked out the door with my two babies and we walked to school. " Feryn I heard someone scream Feryn Chambers." I turned around and then I saw him the one person who I didn't want to see but he was standing right in front of me.
