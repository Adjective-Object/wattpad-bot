He was perfect, everything I wanted in a man, but there is always a but to that lovely statement. My love for him died the day i walked in on him in the arms of another man. Alex and I married five years ago when we left college. We were 18 at that time and were dating but we were still young and reckless.
Our love for each other were indescribable but we never knew we would marry each other one month later to be exact. The reason we got married was because after a night together, I found out two weeks later that I was pregnant with his child because I vomitted everything I comsumed and I had serious mood swings towards him or a matter of fact anyone that dare speak to me at the wrong time.
We decided that we would keep the child because he/she was innocent and it was our recklessness that caused this. We also came to a conclusion that we would just marry each other because we were in love, or so I thought.
My parents died in a car accident a few months before I became 18 so I did not have them to approve of my choice of marriage and I had no other close family. Alex's parents were welcoming and approved of me and my baby once their son was happy with it. From what I learnt of them, they were like those wealthy parents who doesn't really care but just wishea happiness for their children.
