I was so relieved to get home, it felt like a breath of fresh air. Up until I heard the noises coming from my father's room and I walked straight back out.
I just sat there outside, contemplating what it would be like to die. It seems pretty morbid, but this planet obviously didn't care about me and it would affect anyone if I died. Except for my dad. He's the only thing stopping me from suicide. Even though it seems as though he doesn't care about me, I know he would be a wreck if I killed myself.
I could never leave him. I was the only thing he had left. I had to cross the street after the noises got louder and I could hear them from outside. After half an hour, I came back inside and my dad and that woman that I saw this morning were on the couch, guzzling Jack Daniels. When the whore from this morning saw me, she glared at me hatefully.
She looked a little messy, her black hair kind of crazy and I would have complimented her on her really nice skin if she wasn't sleeping with my dad. She and my dad were both sweating like crazy, even though the A/C was on.
Ew.
"I know what you did with my clothes this morning you little brat!" the lady said. I crossed my arms and sneered at her.
"Frankly I think I was doing you a favor. You looked like a checkerboard wearing that skimpy dress. And honestly, I don't think 65 year old women should be wearing such things," I said. She opened her mouth before my slightly drunk dad could intervene.
"Oh please! I am not 65! And you shouldn't talk to adults that way. But it's obvious a skinny thing like you is jealous of a woman like me," she said, flipping her smooth hair.
Biiiittttchhh! The high pitched voice in my mind shouted.
"At least I don't look like Madea," I retorted. Her jaw dropped in disbelief. I smirked, glad to know I got to her.
"You are so rude!" She snapped.
"And you are a slut but I never said anything about that." And with that, I left the room feeling a bit more confident in myself.
Later that night, after banging on my father's door to keep it down, I was dwelling on what that woman had said about me. Why is it that I could stand up to her but not Reed? And what she said about me being jealous. I knew she was just talking about body shape but was I just jealous because she was with my father?
Maybe me not being like her was the big problem. I'm not as beautiful as she is and that could be the reason why nobody likes me. That could be the reason nobody wants to be my friend. Ugh, I wish all this pain would just end already.
