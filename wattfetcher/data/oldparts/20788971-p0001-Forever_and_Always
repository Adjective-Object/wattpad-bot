Carl and I were the only ones left. Everyone else either died off or turned. We had to use a lot of bullets. They even got little a**kicker.
We were low on supplies so, we decided to loot up at a nearby neighborhood. We arrived at the first house and Carl bust down the door.
'Ladies first." he said.
"You're too kind." I said sarcastically.
I went in and got my knife read. Carl followed behind while holding his pistol. We made our way to the kitchen. I searched the cabinets and drawers, while he watched the door. After we were done with the kitchen, we headed upstairs to look around.
We went into the first room we saw. It was most likely the parents room. When we got inside I closed the door, so nothing could get in. After I closed the door, we began to relax a bit. I sat down on the bed and he sat down on a chair that was against the wall. We barely have time for this. We're always on the run. When we do have these moments, I cherish every bit of it.
"Come on," he said while getting to his feet. "We have to finish looking around"
"Fine." I said with a sigh while getting up.
Carl started to look through the dresser. I started to look under the bed. I found this really old watch. I turned to Carl to show him.
"Hey, look at this." I said.
He started to walk towards me to look at the watch. On his way over he tripped over a box. He fell on top of me and we both fell on the bed.
He was hovering over me, staring deep into my eyes. Our lips were so close together, just about an inch apart. Soon Carl began to close the gap. I met him half way and we completely closed it. He gave me a sweet, passionate kiss. The kiss soon became heated. His hand moved from my waist to my thigh, as my hands got tangled into his hair.
I started to tug at the hem of his shirt, but before the kiss could go any farther. We heard heavy foot steps and loud groaning down stairs. He broke the kiss with a sigh.
"I guess we forgot to close the door." I said with a shy smile.
"Yeah, too bad." he said with a smirk.
