Before you could twist the doorknob, Michael burst into your room.
"Who were you just talking to?!" Michael asks you.
"Oh, um, my, uhhhhh... M-My boyfriend." You tell him.
"Boyfriend?! How long have you guys been dating?!"
"Uh, 8 months." You say, giving Michael an apologetic smile.
"8 months! When were you going to tell me about him?"
"Uh, I wasn't." You bite your lip.
Michael is very, very, very, very protective over you about boys. Especially since your last relationship with your abusive boyfriend. Michael can be scary most times, but once you get to know him, he's a total kitten.
Michael lets out an aggravated sigh, "Y/N, I know I'm over protective, but you got to tell me these things! He could of hurt you by now!"
"Liam isn't like that! He's sweet and caring! He couldn't hurt a fly!"
Michael looks up at you and makes you sit beside him on the bed.
"Y/N, I bet he's everything you've just said. But I have to meet him. I just won't feel okay if I don't meet this guy. So, can you arrange something with him so he can meet me?" You lean your head on your brother's shoulder.
"Yeah, in 2 days we're going out on a date, so you can meet him when he come picks me up." Michael kisses the roof of your head.
"Okay, I'd like that."
You text Liam and tell him everything and he couldn't be happier to meet your brother.-------
When the day comes for Liam to meet your brother, you're very nervous. Turns out you didn't have to be. Liam hit it off with your brother. And soon you didn't have to invite Liam over, Michael always texted him before you could to come and hang out. Sometimes it seemed like Michael stole Liam. But you didn't mind. As long as Michael and Liam were happy, you were happy.
