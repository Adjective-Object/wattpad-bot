***********Lucia was on her way to art carrying her portfolio work when the text came from Adrianna telling her them that they would be going to Zara's after school. She stopped in her tracks and started to breath deeply. I wave of sickness hit her and she started to feel faint. It was just starting to properly sink in that her friend had died and she couldn't be more upset. Whilst taking a time out a boy stepped in front of her and asked "hey are you alright you seem like you're not feeling well"
The boy was Kieran Ross, Lucia's crush who she was never able to speak to properly.
Damn why did he have to talk to her and see her when she was not feeling her best. Anyway she thought the best thing to do was to politely answer his question.
"I'm fine thanks, it's just my friend just died and I've got to go help her parents tonight with something's."
"Oh that's right, I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine loosing one of my friends" he said while he gave her a sympathetic look.
"Yeah well, thanks for asking. I better get to class."She said then started to head to art.
"Bye Lucia"He shouted while she scurried off.
OMG he know my name!!!! Was the thought going through her mind.
*********While Clara was on her way to music when a boy dropped his guitar right in front of her.
"Hi sorry about this but I'm kind of in a rush" he said
"That's okay, no harm done. Who's your music teacher?" She asked just out of curiosity.
"Mr O'malley. Do you take music?"
"Aww I'm so jealous he's so nice. Yeah I do I play piano and I have Mrs Yale"
"Yikes that's not so good. But the piano I've always wanted to play." he said smiling at Clara.
"Really, well I tutor for free if you want me to tutor you? If you really are interested?" She said raising her shoulders.
"Yeah that be great. I'm Johnny by the way. You are?"
"Clara. So anyway should we exchange phone numbers so we can text for when we are available"
"Yeah sure thing" he said while handing her his phone and her handing her phone over to him, they typed in their own numbers.
"Okay well I'll text you. Bye Johnny"
"Okay great. Bye Clara"
***********My four friends arrived at my house t 4:30pm. They each walked in and said their hellos to the other people there, including my parents and Adrianna said hello to Callum.
My parents stood in front of everyone and said loud and clear "Zara's funeral will be next Tuesday so we would like it if you could all be there."
Lucia raised her hand and said "with all due respect, aren't they still doing an investigation on who was driving that car?"
"Um no we are closing the case. We just want to bury our daughter and forget this ever happened." My mother said while looking at my father.
All my friends looked at each other puzzled at why they wouldn't want to know who killed me. But they did as my parents wished and agreed to going to the funeral and help them get ready for it.
On their way out the door Adrianna invited Callum back to her house for dinner as her mother wasn't in.
"Yeah sure I haven't had my dinner yet anyway".
