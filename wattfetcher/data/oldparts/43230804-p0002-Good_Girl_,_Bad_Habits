Quinn? I said with a questioning look on my faces.
Yes he said slightly annoyed
Why do you never smile you are always so serious you have no emotion why ?
You smile and laugh all the time baby girl..... but are you really happy?
No not really but i choose to appreciate life i said concerned
Who said I hated it? he said bluntly I just don't fuck with a lot of people he said
I'm not saying you hate it and plus you barely even talk to people
I talk to you he said looking at me
my cheeks turned red
I only talk to people i like and you cool he said finishing it
Can you at least smile for me i said begging
No he said sternly
I reached over and started ticking him he lifted me up and put me on the other side
I started playing with his hair and be removed my hand
I then decided to just lay on him and look up at him and he just sighed and looked down at me like "get tf up" i sighed but while getting up I snuck a kiss but he deepened the kiss I then flipped us over where i was on top I put my hands under his shirt touching his abs and he started squeezing my butt then i went down and pulled his belt he then realized what we was doing and lifted my off of him and got up
Gabby we've been friends for so long I don't know if we could just ruin it by having sex he said with a blank expression
I stood up and looked up at him not caring what he said and kissed him and said
Is your uncle home? i said smirking
No he's never home and you know that he said bluntly
i gave him a duh look I grabbed my shoes and grabbed his hand and we walked to his house and went to his room. I pushed him on the bed and took off his pants and i took off my shirt we looked at each other with pure lust and then said fuck it and then got busy im gonna regret this in the morning
