Sapphire's P.O.V"GET OUT YOU UGLY BITCH" i froze as a hand came flying at my face, slapping me as hard as he could, let me introduce myself I'm Sapphire Parks and the man currently hitting me is my father, yeah my own father its a long story but story short my mother died 4 years ago and ever since my father and my brother have blamed me, which is why he is currently beating the shit out of me i know i have a brilliant life, note the sarcasm, anyways back to the story. "GET OUT NOW" my eyes widened and i shook my head and raised my hands into like a little prayer, beginning him to let me stay, i have learnt not to speak to my brother or my father it only makes them angrier. He shook his head at me "GET OUT YOUR 19 YOU CAN LIVE ON YOUR OWN" that followed with another slap and i scrambled out of the door before he had chance to hit me again. I know what your thinking why didn't i just leave before? Well let me tell you, i have no money all the money i did have my father and my brother spent and they wouldn't let me get a job to earn any money for myself, all my clothes and things i did have considering they're at the house i doubt ill get them back my father is probably smashing up my stuff as i explain this to you, My brother buys this stuff for me, and when i say 'buy' i mean steal, although he hates me he still made sure i had clothes to wear, and lastly i have no where to go all my family hate me and blame me for my mothers death so i'm on my own, a perfect time to end it.
