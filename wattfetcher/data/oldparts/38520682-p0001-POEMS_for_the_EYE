You told me you were reckless,
I forced myself to agree
I still have your old necklace,
From the day you were carefree
I grabbed at it with nothing in mind,
when you were jumping with glee
I told myself to time it right,
even though you were carefree
You never noticed the missing jewel,
the day you were happy
I never knew you could be so cruel
you're now the opposite of carefree
