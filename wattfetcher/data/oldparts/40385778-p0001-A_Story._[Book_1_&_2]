Everyone is in Highschool! That means, everyone in FNaF is 14, 15, 16
Winter's snow was raining down from the gray clouds on the night sky. Have I ever seen snow before? I was never sure...
Everything was dead silent. I reached out my hand, and felt a snowflake land on it.
My smile grew soft.
~~~~~~~~~
I woke up, realizing I was sleeping in class. It was my first day, the class didn't start yet.I rubbed my eyes, hearing someone saying something to me. I looked to my side, seeing a... Girl/Boy, waving her hand at me. It had some red glasses on.
"Excuse me, but do you have a book I can read?"
It sounded like a boy...Maybe it's a girl with a deep voice? Not that deep though..
I shook my head. It sighed, looking back to their desk.I looked around, seeing some weird 'popular' girl taking selfies, a boy just throwing papers at a girl who seemed silent, another girl glaring at a boy with glasses.
Without hesitation, I quickly looked over to my right, and said, "What is your name?"
The boy smiled lightly. "I'm Mike."
"Well, I'm Kathy. Nice to meet you!"
Before Mike could speak, someone coughed very loudly, causing everyone to look over to the door. Realizing, the teacher was standing there, smiling lightly."Hello class! Nice to meet you! I'm Mrs. Hamerson, and I'm looking forward for your respect, and good behaviors!"
"Hi, Mrs. Hamerson...", everyone replied with a tired tone.
"Well, since this is our first day, mind if we introduce ourselves?"
"As the most prettiest and astonishing girl in this class, I'll be first~."The girl with blonde long hair stood up. I gave her a dirty look, remembering she was the 'Selfie-Addict'.
"More like the ugly one...", the lazy bum next to her spoke out, causing some giggles to form around the classroom.
"How dare you? As I was saying... My name is Illizabeth Matson, a proud, pretty, and smart young girl who loves to be popular."
"And boastful..." The boy said again.
Giggles came out again.
The girl shot a glare at him, and sat down, pouting.
"What a nice-", she tried not to laugh. "I-Introduction, Illizabeth!"
Then, a girl who had black hair with dark blue hightlights stood up."Hey. I'm Olivia Heugens, somewhat like the tough type. Annnd, that's all I'm gonna say."
~~~~~~~~ Okay, tired, so I'm just gonna give you information. The old fashioned way! :D ((I think.))
