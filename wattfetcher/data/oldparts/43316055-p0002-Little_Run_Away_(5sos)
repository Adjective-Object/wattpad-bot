He stalks towards my bed and my eyes widen in fear.
"Why won't you just be a good girl for once Becky? This would be a lot less difficult if you just behaved yourself."
He reaches my bed and pulls me out from under the covers. I scream and he slaps me.
"Scream all you want, nobody gives a shit about you. Nobody will hear your cries for help."
Hot,stamy tears flow down my face as he punches me.
James throws me against the wall and starts to kick me. Each kick becomes harder and harder. I scream and cry out in pain. God please take me now, please!
Then, he picks me up and throws me onto the bed. I know what is coming next.
James opens my night table drawer and pulls out the ropes. He grabs each of my wrists and I squirm, trying to escape his hold.
He tsks at me. "Be good," then he slaps me once more.
I let one single tear fall as my arms become tied to the bed. James eyes my body before undressing me.
"D-dad please d-don't," I beg.
He shakes his head and undresses himself.
