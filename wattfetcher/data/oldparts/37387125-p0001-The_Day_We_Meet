Hi my name is Rebecca Gomez, but you can call me Becky. I'm 17 and I live in Texas, but I have to move to Miami because my mom and dad got a better job that pays a lot of money. I didn't want to move because I will have to leave my friends and make new ones. It is hard for me to make new friends. My mom has not got a house yet so my mom, dad, sister, and I have to share a house with Michelle Mahone. My mom says she has a son Austin and he is my age. My mom says he is cute and we will have to go to the same school together.
