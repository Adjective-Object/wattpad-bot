Chapter 1
Katies POV
I looked in the hotel bathroom mirror at myself I was getting ready to go to rockin rio for the night with some friends right when I was about to apply more lipstick to my lips I heard my name called coming from the front door of our hotel room and I guessed that was my friend Emily telling me we were leaving. I put the lipstick down grabbed my purse and was out the door.
Sammys POV
My uber driver pulled us into the vip check in area where we got our bracelets I walked into the Vip area with my friends Nate and Kenney and I took in the the amazing view of all the people and the Brazil theme of the festival.
Katies POV
We finally got to rockin rio right as Tove Lo was performing everything was so beautiful and spinning mostly because of the shots I took on the car ride over. We ran to the crowd just in time for Stay High and as people passed drinks and blunts around I felt free and alive as I took shots and hits for a various amount of blunts. As soon as Tove Lo was over I stumbled over to VIP and ran into a boy he helped me up and I was about to walk away but he held my arm and asked me if I was ok I hadn't looked at his face and as soon as I did I wish I hadn't.
Sammys POV
I went downstairs to the bathroom and was heading to the bar to grab a drink when a girl ran into me I smelled the alcohol and weed on her and knew at this moment she was done for the night, but as I took a look at her I couldn't help but notice how beautiful she was. I grabbed her by her arm making sure she didn't fall over and asked her if she was alright as she looked up with her beautiful hazel eyes I couldn't help but stare at her, she crookedly smiled at me and slurred "I'm fine not even that drunk." Which caused me to laugh cause I knew from the looks and smell of it how fucked up she really was. Her friends soon came running as soon as catching sight of her screaming her name and saying thank god we found you I noticed they were a little less drunk so I offered to take care of her while they went and enjoyed the concert. They got a little weird because of the fact that I was a total stranger. But the blonde girls face lit up after a couple seconds of staring at me and said "Oh my god! Aren't you Sammy Wilk! Dude I fuckin love you! Tara he's fine I know who he is. were fine." As soon as she said that Tara just replied with a quick ok and said to call her phone if anything happens, which was dumb cause I didn't have her number. They ran off to the large crowd of fans screaming for Taylor Swift. I took her to a nearby table and ordered her two water bottles. She drank the water and we talked even though her responses were mostly irrelevant and stupid because she was intoxicated I noticed her starting to sober up a lot the more she drank the water. As we sat there and talked I couldn't stop looking at her eyes causing me to randomly blurt out " you have beautiful eyes." As soon as I said that she batted her eyelashes than looked down and mumbled a thank you. I noticed my phone had lit up a couple times and checked it seeing Nate and Kenney have been wondering where I went for the past hour I texted them back about what happened and that I would go up there in a couple minutes right when I sent the text She excused herself to go to the bathroom. As she got up and walked away I couldn't help but stare she had the perfect curves she had a large shaped ass. I realized I never asked her for her name or anything and I'm pretty sure she didn't know mine so that was the first thing I would bring up when she came back. I went on my phone and scrolled through my Twitter some fans tweeting me to go outside VIP who were waiting to meet me I decided to fav the tweet and follow the girl and tell her I would go out in a bit. As I sent the tweet she walked back and sat back down in her seat across from me. She seemed to be sober and when I had the chance I held out my hand and introduced myself and she told me her name was Katie.
