Amelia walks over to her, "Whats your name again kiddo?"
The girls face was dirty, her blonde hair a mess, and her blue eyes big and scared. She didnt say anything, but then Amelia noticed her hands, and she was signing.
'My names Annie,' signed the little girl.
Amelia sat down next to her, and signed back, thankful that she learned it, 'how old are you?'
Annie held up six fingers.
'Im going to call to find out where your parents are, whats your last name?' Amelia asked.
Annie signed quickly, 'Lumir'.
Amelia pulled her phone out again, dialing Vixs' number, "Heya Vix. Anything on a six year old named Annie Lumir? Blonde Hair, Blue eyes."
Amelia could hear clicking from a keyboard on the other line, Vix let out a sigh, "Well I found something."
Amelia perked up at the sound of his voice, "What?"
"Rebecca and Darren Lumir, died 5 months ago in a pile-up on the highway."
She hung up the phone and turned to Annie, 'Annie, you're parents', she started to sign but looked down.
Annie waved her hand to get Amelias attention, 'I know they died.'
Amelia looked at her oddly, 'How?'
'Because I got here 4 months ago,' Annie signed quickly.
Amelia sighed, 'Oh, do you want to come stay with me tonight until we contact your other relatives?'
Annie looked up at Amelia, 'I guess so.'
Amelia lit a cigarette and started walking, Annie right next to her.
'Those are bad for you,' Annie signed.
'I know,' Amelia said.
They stopped at a little store for kids, thankful it was still open.
'Lets get you some new clothes,' Amelia signed.
Annie nodded and they walked inside. Amelia let Annie get whatever she wanted, she went into the dressing room to change into her new clothes while Amelia waited outside the door. They then walked to get some food and Annie fell asleep on the table after eating. Amelia carried her home and layed Annie down on her bed and went to the couch. Soon Amelia, The Wasp, let her eyes close and drifted to sleep.
