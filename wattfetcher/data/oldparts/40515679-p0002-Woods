"We are so proud! Let's go." They started walking off. I told them that I would be there in a second. Mal walked up to me with a dirty look.
"Look. I'm sorry for anything that I ever did to make you mad.  You can be mad at me all you want, I don't care. I'm done, just done with you acting like this!" She gave me the most shocked look she has ever given me. I walked away towards Mike.
"Hi." He smiled and hugged me.
"What are you doing?" He let go. He looked at Mal, who looked like she was planning my death, and flipped her off.  She was shocked.
"I thought you were dating her?" I gave him a confused look.
"Were is the key word in that sentence." He kissed me on the lips! My crush kissed me! Was about to pass out. I was so surprised. I just kissed back.
"I have to go, here's my number." I handed him my number and ran away. Mal took off running after me.
"What the hell do you think you are doing!" She screamed at me. I just looked at her like she was crazy, which she is.
"I thought Mike and I were dating!" She started crying and hugging me. I pulled away.
"1. Were is the key word in that sentence and 2. I have cried so many times from you acting like an ass to me, so this is way to late. Goodbye!" I walked away. I looked at Mike. He gave me a thumbs up and walked away.
