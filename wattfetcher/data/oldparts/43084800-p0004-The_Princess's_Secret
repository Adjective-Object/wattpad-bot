"What are you doing?!" I yell angrily. That's when I realize I'm completely naked. I grip the silk bed sheets to my chest, hoping they won't slip down.
"I can't keep going if this person will keep knocking, it's distracting. And besides, I've had enough. Haven't you?"
"What?!? What kind of man doesn't want to go all the way!?" I shriek, feeling like I was just a pawn.
"Well, thank you and all, for this, but perhaps another time." He is buttoning his shirt when the door bursts open, a guard standing at fault for breaking my door down.
"What the hell?!" I shriek as wood splinters in every direction.
"I'm sorry your highness, but it's urgent, you have to come with me now." The guard doesn't waste any time in explaining, he rushes over quickly and grabs me by the arm, his hand wrapping around my bicep.
"How dare you touch me!" I yell angrily at the guard.
He pulls me out from under the bed sheets, and a wave of cold air hits me hard.
"Ohh... shit..." The guard quickly turns around, but it's to late.
He's already seen everything.
"You bastard! I'll have your head for this! I'll kill you! I'll kill you myself! I'll kill you!" I shout enraged. I fling myself at the guard, but it's Nicholas who stops me, he has an arm around my waist and is holding back as best as he can.
"Go! I'll take care of this!" He yells at the guard, who nods, and mumbles his apologies several times to many for my liking.
"Let go of me! How dare you touch me as well! I'll have you tried for sexual abuse! You asshole! Let me go!"
Nicholas, eventually shuts me in my own bathroom, naked. With my closet locked and my only choice of some clothing in the bedroom, I'm forced, in my own home to run around naked like a crazy woman.
They are so going to die.
