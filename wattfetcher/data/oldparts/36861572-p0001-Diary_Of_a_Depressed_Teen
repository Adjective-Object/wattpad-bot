Sam's POV. Hey journal let me tell you about my self I just moved, I have blonde hair. outstanding blue eyes, and I am constantly bullied. I am 16 and I've never had a first kiss, party, boyfriend or any of that stuff. No one likes me I'm a loner and my favorite color is black. I have never stayed anywhere too long. I live with my mom and brother but he just ignores me he is what you would call a meathead jock. I better go for now bye.
