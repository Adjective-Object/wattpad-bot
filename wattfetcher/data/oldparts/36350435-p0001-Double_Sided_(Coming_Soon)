Hey guys!! I decided to just write a new story. I hope y'all will like it! The first part will be in Jenna's point of view. I won't publish this until I finish most of it. I know that I could be able to put out an update every day but I'm deciding to space it out. I probably will update 1-2 chapters every couple weeks or so. Please bear with me! I am only putting out the prologue for y'all to get a feel of how the book will begin.
