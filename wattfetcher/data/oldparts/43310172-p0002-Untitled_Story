Like my best friend Colette who was just as happy as I was to be single, maybe even more. Although she believed in love but didn't go lurking for it around every corner like most.
I mean I had my fair share of flings throughout high school and even now but none gave me that feeling everyone describe. Where you don't see anyone but that person, just feeling like you can completely give yourself to someone. So I was positive it was an imaginary thing.
And I lived in Hawaii which meant hot shirtless boys all year round. Yet none of them were any different from the next.
So I would happily continue living my life in paradise the way I had been for years on end.
People could make all their jokes about me being so not sweet for someone named Sugar but again I couldn't care less.
It was my life so I would live it the way I wanted not the way that anyone else wanted me to live. And frankly anyone who didn't care for it could suck it and that was the last of it.
So call me crazy but love didn't exist. But who knows maybe one day my perspective will change.
Probably not.
