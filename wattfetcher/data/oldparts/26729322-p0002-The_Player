"I have to go." I pushed my way past him and left him standing there alone in the hallway. I made it to my next class without him chasing after me or catching up which was good.
"Ella!" I heard my best friend Sara call.
"Hey Sara." I said sitting down in the seat next to her. I was just about to tell her what happened in the hallway when the bell rang.
"I'll tell you after." I said as the professor started class.

At the end of class Sara and I walked to our next class together and I told her about my encounter with Niall. I tell her literally everything. She's been my best friend for the longest time.
"He did not! Ella, you can't let him take advantage of you. You've seen what he's done to those other girls. He's practically ruined them."
"I know Sara, and that's what I'm afraid of. What if he keeps trying to flirt with me and stuff?"
"Just avoid him. He's trouble."
"I know, I will." I said with a sigh.

Once I got back to my dorm after all my classes, I dropped my backpack on the ground and laid on my bed staring at the ceiling. The whole day I kept thinking about my encounter with Niall. Why did he say we should hang out sometime? Why did he want to get to know me better? Why was he even talking to me? I knew I had to stay away from him. I didn't want to end up being his next puppet girlfriend.
