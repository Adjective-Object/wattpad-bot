i.
she has a gun in her mouth and it's trained on me. i keep asking her to put on the safety, but she never listens to me. i guess you can say i now have a holey soul, and every time she shoots, she tells me she doesn't mean to hit me but i'm the one who always ends up bleeding.

MAYBE THIS WAS A SIGN?
I DON'T KNOW I LIKED THE WAY SHE HELD MY HANDS AND HOW HER EYES LOOKED INTO MINE, MOM. I NEVER KNEW THE DEVIL COULD PLAY SO NICE, I NEVER KNEW SHE COULD DIG HER WAY STRAIGHT THROUGH MY HEART.
you always warned me about giving out my hearts for other people, mom. you said, "If you aren't careful enough, you'll give somebody too many pieces of your heart and you will be left with nothing but that empty soul of yours'."
i thought you were lying when you told me this, but you laughed at me and said i was stubborn like dad. i had his name anyway - keith and i looked almost exactly like him. maybe that's why you can't look at me the same way, maybe that's why you stopped talking me after he died.
i try looking for the good in you, but all i see is that empty soul of yours' and it scares the hell outta me, mom.
it scares me i'm turning into you, too.
iii.
dear life,
fuck you.
no, seriously. i try and try and try again to see what this is all meant for. is it meant for me to learn for something in the future? or am i fated to have another terrible thing happen to me time and time again?
i feel like she tore my universe apart and im falling into a black hole. the same feeling i got when dad died.
i still see that gun in her mouth. this time it's an automatic and whenever i see her at school, she makes sure to hit me.
i didn't know things can go so bad until you turn left instead of right.
tell God up there he needs to do some revising on this novel he's writing about me because my life isn't doing so well. i'm not doing so well.
maybe some other time. i'm tired.

IM SORRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU THAT NIGHT. YOU WERE
SUPPOSE TO FALL FOR SOMEONE
THAT WAS GOING TO TUCK YOU IN AND

I WAS NONE OF THOSE THINGS AND I JUST
WASTED YOUR TIME.
IM SORRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
