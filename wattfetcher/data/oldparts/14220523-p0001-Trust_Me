AJ's POV
I just sat there. Shaking, in the corner. Hiding from the world around me; my family; my friends; the WWE universe. I cant go out there. I don't know who's watching. It's to dangerous. Why did I decide to come back? I'm not stable enough. Everyone's right. I am crazy. And there's nothing I can do about it.
NOTE: THIS IS FAKE. IT IS A FANFIC. I OWN NO CHARACTERS IN THIS STORY. IT'S JUST MY WWE IMAGINATION.
