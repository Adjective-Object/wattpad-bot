The front door opens and I hear my mom's voice."Becky, James?! Are you two still up?"
Her footsteps come closer to my door and the handle begins to open. I feel relief wash over me when mom comes in.
She looks at the scene before her and then smiles a sick smile. "Have you started James?"
My eyes widen. She knew?! This whole time she knew and she never stopped him?! Not once.
I knew that nobody was going to save me. I can only rely on myself. Trust no one.
My mom sits at my desk chair and watches my dad defile my body. When he is finished he unties my hands and they walk out together.
I  immediately run to my bathroom. I feel so dirty. I scrub and scrub at my body till it is red.
What did I do to desrve this?!
*end of flashback*
I wipe the tears from my eyes and continue to pack my stuff. Tonight I am leaving and I don't plan on coming back.
Everything that is important to me is in my bag. I grab one more tissue and blow my nose.
Quickly walking to the little safe in my closet I pull out the money I had been saving up for college.
I stuff the money in my bag and head towards my window. Slowly opening the window, I slip out into the night.
I knew that this would be the last night my parents ever saw me,the last anyone in my town ever saw of me.
I left for good and I never planned on coming back.
