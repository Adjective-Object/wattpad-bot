Abby's p.o.vI was setting in math class with my friends the teacher let us do whatever because it's our last day here at this school. I was so excited to get out of school but at the same time I was going to be sad , because I would be going to college and I am going to miss my friends. This is my last class , last class ever before I go off to college , last class I have before I leave this school. I had a lot of memories here and I'll never forget it. The bell rang , I hugged all my friends goodbye. This is it I'm going to college after this summer , I have to make this summer the best. I get in my car and drive home happy that I'm not in school anymore. "I'm home" I yelled "hey sweaty so how do you feel about go to college?"my mom said "I'm kinda nervous"i said honestly "honey it's okay you'll be fine"she said smiling I smiled back "I'm going to go to my room" I said "okay sweaty" she said. I go up stairs to see my little brother Mason playing with his cars. "hey Mason" I said "hi Abby" he said back. I just walked away letting him play with his cars. I went to my room putting music on and cleaning my room. It was 6:30 I decided to take a shower. After it was about 7:30,I just sat on my bed on my phone. My mom came and told me dinner was ready, I went down stairs and saw everyone at the table. "I have exciting news" dad said "what is it" said mom "we are going to a beach house , for the whole summer and we leave in 2 days , also there well be another family coming with us." dad said "okay so we leave on Sunday?" I asked "yes" dad said. After that I helped my mom clean and I said goodnight to everyone and went to bed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HEY GUYYYYS so this is my first chapter how do u like it so far?okay I'm going to go but follow my fan page @mrr.espinosa
