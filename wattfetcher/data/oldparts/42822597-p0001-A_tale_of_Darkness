Ch.1
Why does school always have to be so damn boring?It's a nice day, clouds are covering the purple morning sky and a tiny breeze makes the treetops move in perfect sync.
And I have to watch it from inside a classroom filled with disgusting human beings.
I want to silently apologize for having that opinion,but sadly it's true. I sigh and let myself sink deeper into my chair. Class only just started a few minutes ago and I'm already bored.
The teacher, an old guy trying to make us learn about science, isn't even really motivated himself. Then again, he is a teacher after all.
I open my textbook and start solving the given problems without putting effort in it. I only scribble nonsense on my paper, trying to make it look like I'm working.
The classroom is filled with constant laughter of the popular people,
the ssshs of the naive good people,
the snoring of the "I don't even give a fuck" people, as i call them,
and the bragging of badboys trying to impress anyone within their view. I let out a small growl and look outside the window next to me. I'm sitting in the back with nobody next to me except some other creeps. Some other creeps? Yes, i count myself to the creeps. I myself don't know if that's confident or self-destructive.
It's probably just realistic.
I, Jen, am the queen of the creeps, purple-haired and purple-eyed little girl with some, more like alot, mental issues.Nice to meet you.
