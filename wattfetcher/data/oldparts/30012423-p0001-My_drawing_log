My first ever chibi and first ever time drawing enderlox so don't judge. My best friend @nixdatademon has a strange obsession with skybrine, enderlox, and witherMU (like seriously she even has a reading list of stories about these guys) so I thought I'd give her a present. If your reading this, Twilight, then if you want I could draw Skybrine next but I don't know. Hope you like it!
Time taken: 3 hours, 12 minutes, and 48 seconds (altogether since I edited it a few times; might edit again)Program: ibisPaint X (free)Songs: Frame of Mind (Monstercat 017 - Ascension)And i forgot which others but this is what i listened to half the time in drawing this
