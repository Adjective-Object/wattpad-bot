~Brienna's POV~
Let's get one thing strait. I've never dated, and because of one reason. My brother. My brother, Matthew, is the typical over protective brother. My parents are absolutely fine with me dating, but my brother acts like a dad. He is my best friend though. I love him.
"Brianna! Are you ready?!" He yelled through the house. "Yeah, I just need to put my shoes on, and by the way, you didn't have to yell. I was in the hall." I said. "Oh.." He said.
Since Matt turned 18, he's leaving for college, and is gonna live with the rest of Magcon. And my mom said i could go with him! She said it would be good for me to get to know Cali. Oh yeah! We're gonna live in California!
He grabbed my bags and brought them to the car. I was currently texting my best friend, Kirsten.
FROM KIRSTEN
HEY BITCH! IM COMING TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO WEEKS. DONT HAVE TOO MUCH FUN WHILE IM NIT THERE. LOL.
TO KIRSTEN
WHAT FUN WOULD MATT LET ME HAVE? IM PROBABLY GONNA BE ON HOUSE ARREST UNTIL I MOVE OUT.
FROM KIRSTEN
YOU KNOW THATS HIS NATURE. THATS HOW MY BROTHER WAS BEFORE HE MOVED OUT. YOU KNOW YOU LOVE HIM!
And she was right. No matter how sheltered i was with Matty, he will always be there for me. I am only 15. Its understandable. Ok, its definitely not understandable. But, i guess he's jusr doing his job.
"Can you like get in the car?" I looked up to see Matt already in the car. "Oh, yeah, sorry. I was texting Kirsten." I said, getting in. "Can we get Starbucks?" I asked. He nodded and drove off.
"What do you want?" He asked when we pulled up to Starbucks. "Matt, you should know this. Charamel macchiatto, duh." I said. "Iced." I added. "Thats what Hayes always gets." He said laughing.
I looked away so he couldnt see me blush. If you figured i liked Hayes, you were correcr. I fell asleep in the middle of my thoughts. What felt like five minutes later, i was woken up.
I opened my eyes to see Cameron. "Oh, i guess were here." I said laughing. "Yeah, Matt went inside to pick up the bags. He told me to waje you up. But anyway, hey!" He said, flashing a big smile. I smiled back than got out of the car. Whoa! The house was huge!
