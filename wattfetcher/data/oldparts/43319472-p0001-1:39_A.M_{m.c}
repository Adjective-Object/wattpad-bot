'Gracie Andrews.' Was written in black marker on the piece of white paper my father was holding up while he waited for me to get off the plane. It was pointless for him to look for me, the last time he saw me was five years ago when I was 12 - I still had tame brown hair and an innocent child like face back then. He is definitely in for a shock when he finds out that his little girl is now 5 foot 7 with bright blue hair and a huge love for metal bands.
"Hi." It took me five minutes of staring at him to finally pluck up the courage to walk over, the main reason being that my feet were beginning to hurt and I wanted to get out of this crowded airport. He looked straight at me for a few seconds before frowning, "Gracie?" The look of shock on his face would almost be amusing, if it didn't hurt so much that he didn't know anything about the way I looked. I merely nodded, internally scowling at him for using such a disgusting pet name.
"Wow, look at you, all grown up." He manages to crack a smile through the shock, but I can see instantly how disappointed he is that I didn't grow up to be who he wanted, not that his opinions meant anything to me. I had many thoughts whirling around in my mind that I really wanted to say out loud, but I decided to be mature and keep it to myself to avoid an argument on the first day I was here.
"Are you ready to go? It's quite a long car ride back to the house." He took one of the suitcases from me and I followed slowly as he walked towards the exit. JFK had to be the biggest airport I had ever been inside, and by far the most crowded. I must have accidentally hit about twenty people with my suitcase by the time we got to the door, which made me pretty happy to finally be out in the open. The atmosphere of the streets were completely different to back in England, everyone seems a lot more rushed and less friendly, nobody looked at you and smiled or said hello.
"You get used to it here after a while, it took me months before I started to fit in." My fathers words were probably supposed to comfort me, but honestly made me feel a lot worse. If it took him months to fit in, how long would it take me to fit in to a new school? After all, I'll be the weird new girl from England who joined half way through a school year.
My dads car was parked five minutes away from the airport, probably so he didn't have to pay for airport parking, and despite his best efforts of trying to make conversation I stayed silent for most of the drive to his house. "Before we go inside I need to tell you something." He says after we sit in the parked car for two minutes in silence, I turn my head to look at him, barely making out the outline of his face in the pitch black.
"You have a sister, Ashley, she's 4." The smile on his face as he told me made my heart stop momentarily, I wonder if he ever smiles like that when he tells people about me. Does he tell people about me? Why didn't he tell me he has a daughter before today? Surely that would be a pretty big thing you'd want your daughter living across the world from you to know. I felt my throat closing up and the air inside the car was getting heavier and heavier as the seconds went by, so I put on the biggest smile I could muster and got out of the car quickly, gasping for fresh air.
"She'll be asleep now though, you'll have to wait until the morning to meet her. She's been so excited to see her big sister." He slammed the car door shut and grabbed the two suitcases from the car, walking towards the front door. Can you really call someone you've never met your sister? Aren't there rules about this kind of thing?
"Finally! Where is she?" I heard a female voice as soon as my dad unlocked the door and pushed it open and within ten seconds a tall blonde woman was rushing out of the door towards me with a huge grin on her face and her arms open wide. She instantly pulled me in for a smothering hug that made me extremely uncomfortable, however I hugged her back to avoid feeling too awkward.
