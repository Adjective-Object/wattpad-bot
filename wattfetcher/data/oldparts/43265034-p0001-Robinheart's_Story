I coughed roughly my lungs burning as the monster sprays dirty bad smelling gas in my face. I stumble away from it running away towards the allies carrying the piece of chicken I found. "Momma, momma! I found you some chicken." I run over to my mother who is expecting kits. She looks angry, "What?! Just one piece of chicken, are you trying to starve me Robin?!! Go back out and get me some more food!" She hits me hard on the head with her claws unsheathed opening up a new wound on my face. I yelp in pain as blood starts to flow from the wound, "Yes momma I will I promise!" I run away in search of more food hearing her distant call in the background, "Next time you bring me one piece of food I'll kill you! That's will be your punishment for starving your own mother!" I flinch, but keep running stumbling every once and a while. I murmur to myself, "I'll please you momma I promise."
