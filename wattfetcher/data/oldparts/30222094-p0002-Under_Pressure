As an author, I really like to interact with my readers, so every chapter I have a couple questions that I ask about the book or yourself. Next chapter I will answer the same questions I offer for my readers. I really like it when people do answer, but whatever. I mean it only fills me with confidence. Psh! Who needs that? Okay. Me. Now I'm sounding desperate, so I'm going to move on.
Chapter 1's Questions:1. Do you have any siblings?2. Who is your favorite wattpad author?
Next Chapter: First day of school!
Update: Next Saturday
