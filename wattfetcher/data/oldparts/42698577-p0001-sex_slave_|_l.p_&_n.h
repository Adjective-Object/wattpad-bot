Hello, there. There are certain misunderstandings that I want to get clear before I start writing.
First of all, i've not been on this account for about a year since I was dealing with LIFE. My 'fangirling' for One Direction has kind of died down but that does not mean I dislike or hate them. I respect everything they do and the choices they make; including Zayn's.
As a result of Summer holidays coming up for me in less than a month, i have more free time to go back to stuff i used to like. This means i can finally start writing a god damn book!
Recently, i've started to really love 5sos so there might be future 5sos shippings i might write a fanfiction about. So, watch out for those! I adore Lashton, Muke and Cake.
However, this story is obviously based on Niam. About a year ago, I was the most sexually frustrated girl in the world, as you can tell by my username. I had no chill, honestly. But now i've matured I guess so yeah.
I do not have a particular day that I will choose to update. I'm a lazy creature so i'll try to update whenever I feel like it. Once a week, probably.
On that note, I hope you will enjoy reading my book. Peace.
