Bella prov.Today is the day I go on a plane and spend the last year of school in a small town in Washington named forks. My dad asked if I'd like to come and see him and I have missed him a lot. There is my dad's friend Billy Black and his son Jacob I have not seen them in 9 years. My mom drops me of at the airport and I am on my way to forks under constant cloud.
*After flight*
I see my dad standing by his police car, he is sheriff. Once I get to his car I give him a hug and he hugs me back. On our way home he says "you remember Billy and jacob right" I answer "of course" jacob and I used to hang out all the time during the summer when I still came. He says "well I was wondering if you would like to go over there for dinner tonight.
