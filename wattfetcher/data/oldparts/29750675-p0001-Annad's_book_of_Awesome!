I got nominated by @riverivy to write my journey to Wattpad. So first let me write my past:

During eight grade I was constantly bullied in every way possible. I was cyber, social, physical, and verbally bullied. The only thing that cheered me up was reading. I kept reading Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus. Once I reached the house of Hades I ran out of books to read so I searched for an alternative. I tried reading Divergent, but it wasn’t my type of book. Harry Potter wasn’t my type either. I tried reading, but kept getting bored. So I searched for a book site and Wattpad was what I found.
