Baee: im in the car omw to see the girls ( Ranyah Simmiya Leanna Derreka Stephanie Tianna an)but anyway the doctor is on the other line ima put it in a conference call
Me:aight
Doctor: Am I speaking with Simmiya and August Alsina
Us:Yea
Doctor:Ok so im calling to let you kniw the results on the tests we took the last time you were here
Us: ok
Doctor:the good news is that ms.alsina was pregnant with twins .... But the bad news is you lost the babies and since the plane crash from a month ago you busted an ovary which you already knew... The thing with that is now you have very low chance of getting pregnant...you have less that 10 percent chance of pregnancy...I'm so sorry.
Baee: oh my gawd (cries very loudly into phone) you know I've always dreamed about having kids and having a baby in my stomach and I lost not one but two
Me: Baee I'm so(gco by a loud boom)Phone call ends
