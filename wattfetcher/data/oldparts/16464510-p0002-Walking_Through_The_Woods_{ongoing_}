As they started fighting Will sustained deep gashes in his arms,legs and face and the vampire was now trying to strangle Will. I was a helpless,screaming, wreck and  as the vampire turned his focus to me Will used it to catch the vampire off guard and managed to grapple the vampire off him and into a nearby tree. Will turned to me "Callista , run,now !" I didn't want to but the look in his eyes made me go. I run like my life depends on it,which it kinda does. I really regret wearing dolly shoes as I'm running a keep slipping. I'm getting close to the border of the woods, a glimmer of hope sparks within me, and I lose that spark when I'm tackled to the ground. I do the only thing I do best. Scream. I take a deep breath and with all the strength in me I scream. I scream for Will. I scream for my mum. I scream for my life. I scream as the vampire's fangs got closer and closer to my throat. He froze for a millisecond before covering my mouth as I was still screaming. He smirked evilly  then he snarled at me. "Scream once more and I'll-" I heard another voice that held so much power the vampire was quivering. I also heard footsteps a lot of footsteps. " You'll do what exactly ?" The vampire's gaze snapped to the mystery voice. He then turned back to me. "This isn't over." He smirks then I feel a blending pain in my head. I cry out then I feel nothing. I see nothing. Everything is black.
