You are taking the night shift btw
H-H-HELLO!? said the Phone guy of course.
Phone Guy: Welcome to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. (ETC.)
You: Wait! Don't go!
Phone Guy: Hmm?
You: I know this sounds sudden but, can you come and help me with my first shift?
Phone Guy: Well... I don't know if they allow two guards on the same night, But you are new here so I guess I can show you the ropes.
You: thank you Mr....
Phone Guy: Oh, I'm not married. You can just call me Scott.
You:Oh ok, well Scott.. Thank you!

"Hello you must be Y/N" said Scott with a friendly smile. (oh gawd he's cute-pff wait what!?) "Umm.. nice to meet you I-I- mean it person!" "Yeah, I get it a lot about the phone on my head" he said taking a seat next to you. "I wasn't referring to that but, I think you look cute" When you finally realized what you had said to your new coworker you blushed pure red. "I-I-I mean" Scott then chuckled at your mistake but took it by heart so he blushed as well.
The rest of the evening went fine until Bonnie showed up at the door unexpectedly. You jumped back and buried your face into Scott's chest. He then did something unexpected, He wrapped his arms around you. Causing you to look up. He then touched his lips with yours (IDK if he has lips but just roll with it) Your eyes widened but kissed back.
I'm gonna end it here. but be true to yourself you just came here for the smooches. I CAN READ MINDS
