Kayla's POV
Beep, beep, beep, I wake up to the sound of my alarm being a cunt. Woke me up at the best part. Calum and I were about to kiss. Ugh the fangirl struggle. I get up from bed and brush my hair in the mirror deciding that the usual "natural down" style is good enough for today. I put on concealer because flaws galore and mascara because eyelashes be short af. I stick my tongue out in the mirror making several funny faces then realize that it's time to brush my teeth and eat breakfast. I groan and stand up walking downstairs to the bathroom (my room is the attic). I start to brush my teeth while looking at Twitter thinking about what I should have for breakfast. BUZZ BUZZA text from my best friend, Izzy or as labeled in my phone "BbeyoncÃ©". texts:Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyy
Heeeey brushing my teeeeeethhh
Brusha Brusha Brusha ðŸŽ§
Omfg ðŸ˜‚
Shhh
You going to school today?
Duh, gotta see my bÃ¦ yo
True, true
Hahaha
I laugh and finish brushing my teeth. Time for food!!!!! What to eat, what to eat, I think to myself. Cereal. Simple and quick. I grab a bowl, milk, and of course Captain Crunch (or as my friend nicknamed it "Calum Crunch"), my favorite cereal. I sit down and start eating. I open up my twitter account "thattumblrgurl_" and tweet 'Eating Captain Crunch Im so cool'. I literally tweet just to tweet sometimes. I smile a bit enjoying my wonderful food then realize, today's the first day of school, DUN DUN DUN! I groan at the thought of school and finish my cereal. I run back up my stairs realizing something else, I'm still in pajamas. I put on a red flannel that's actually for guys and is an XL, oops. I also put on black skinny jeans, my all black converse and grab my book bag. I begin to double check to make sure I have everything. All ready, let's do this. I rush out the door heading to my bus stop. Time to go to hell.
