Dear Prissy Girls,You think you're much better than the rest of us flipping your hair and giggling like you are robots programed to do that. You are human barbie dolls. You wear tiny clothes that look as if they were your old baby clothes, wear so much makeover you look like a clown, you stop eating so you can have a super model body but turn out looking like a skeleton. You think everyone likes you well I don't like you. I'm not saying every girl just prissy girls.
