The wise angel who led the other progressing angels ,slowly suffered from a disease which was known as darkness to her .It was given by the demons ,the devils and the human creatures who created hatred and pain .it was too much for her to endure Without knowing time passing by ,the wise angel passed away as her son was sitting next to her listening to these few dying words "please you m-must ..........find that girl......... in the human world. . . . you will know if you see her eyes....glow light green ....or if she has .......Scarlet hair .....by using my amulet ....youuu ............might find that girl.......and....please...do not worry......... it's time for me to go .......after living for a long time.. . . . . pro....tecting, a..n..d l..o..v.ing you angels". As she said them last few words her voice slowly disappeared and she sadly died.
For at least 1 year her son was depressed after the wise angel dying but as time went on he finally realised that he cannot stay depressed foreverHe has to carry on the LEGACY on which was passed by his own motherSo will he ever find that girl ?Will he be able to find the new fated queen ?
