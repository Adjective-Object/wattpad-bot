Chloe's POV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hi, I'm Chloe Avery Mikaela Green, long name I know. My YouTube channel is ChloeVSGaming. Today, me and Ashley are heading to LA to meet up with the guys. I've only played with them on Minecraft, so I have no idea what they're like behind the screen.
I have dark brown hair with light purple and light blue curly tips (She dip-dyed the tips). Also, I have ocean blue eyes mixed with emerald green.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ashley woke me up, meaning we've landed. I kept refusing to go to sleep in case we crash or something because I'm not used to travelling on planes.
We hopped off the plane and went to the luggage claim. Ashley's boyfriend - Mitch, which I find really cute - will be picking us up and taking us to the house.
After getting our luggage, which was like a suitcase each, we headed to the main area and saw Mitch. He ran up to us and greeted us with hugs, he gave Ashley a peck on the cheek.
We started to walk towards the car, me needing my space, I sit in the back by myself. Ashley in front and Mitch driving.
As we drove back, I put in my headphones and started to listen to 5SOS's Heartbreak Girl.
You call me up,
It's like a broken record,
Sayin' that your heart hurts,
And you can never get over him gettin' over you,
And you end up crying,
And I end up lying,
'Cause I'm just a sucker for anythin' that you do,
And when the phone call finally ends,
You say, "Thank for being a friend.",
And we're going in circles again and again.
I dedicate this sing to you,
The one who never sees the truth,
That I can take away your hurt,
Heartbreak Girl,
Hold you tight straight through the daylight,
