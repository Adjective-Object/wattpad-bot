*beep beep*It's Sunday July 5th 2015, the day after Ashley's birthday. She is now officially an adult, 18. She still lives with her parents since she is still in school. She wakes up at the same time every day, 6:30. She has a routine: shower,blow dry her hair, get dressed, grab a granola bar, and walk to school. Today was no different, she got up showered then went to her vanity to blow dry her purple hair. She put on her usual attire: high waisted shorts (high waisted pants when it's cooler) ,a crop top and vans. When she was done she decided to skip grabbing a gronola bar, since she was running a little late.
