Rikka Otsuka:
"Rikka-chan! I'm home!" This must be Juuzou.
"Juuzou-kun!" I shouted back, very happy that he was finally home. Because of his work, I didn't see him often.
"Come here! I want you to meet someone!" he said, then giggled.
Meet someone? Along with his voice, there was another one;
As I got closer to the living room, the strange voice became more clear. As soon as I opened the door, Juuzou's laugh followed the noise the door made. I was beyond happy that I finally saw him, what made me unhappy was the unfamiliar face that sat on the couch laughing too.
"Um.." I mumbled, trying to get his attention.
"Rikka-chan!" he shouted once again, rose up from the couch to give me a tight hug, spinning me around; "This is my girlfriend, Rikka! Rikka-chan, this a friend that I met at Hatori's restaurant, Kou Iwai." he said as he put me down.
"Nice to meet you." He smiled. His voice was way different than Juuzou's, his voice was very deep. He gave me a bad vibe, but for Juuzou's sake, I'll get along with him. He seems very happy with him here, and who am I to ruin his happiness?
"Yeah, nice to meet you too." I smiled.
"Your girlfriend is pretty cute, you're lucky, man." Kou said, patting his shoulder.
"I know right?" Juuzou said, looking at me. My face turned red.
We watched all night horror movies and almost burned the kitchen because of Juuzou's cooking. Guess this "Kou" wasn't that bad.

Every time Juuzou was at work, Kou would come here often and hang out with me. We would go to candy shops, parks, he even went with me to the mall! But to be honest, I wished I would do this with Juuzou. Today, I'm making pancakes for Juuzou with Kou! It was around the hour Juuzou would return from work, he will be very happy when he sees this! After that, I planned for us three to go to the summer festival to watch the fireworks. Well, first I planned to go only with Juuzou, but since Kou is already here, why not?
"Wow! These pancakes look so good! I can't wait for Juuzou-kun to see this!" I squealed, looking at the pancakes.
"Yeah, good job, Rikka-chan." Kou smiled, patting my head.
I put the pancakes in a plate along with some syrup.
He'll love them. I said to myself, smiling even wider.
"I'm gonna wait for him in the living room." I said, exiting the kitchen.
Just as I opened the living room's door, the apartament's door was slammed and a cheerful voice shouted "I'm home!"
"Juuzou-kun!" I yelled, and as soon as he noticed me his smile widened.
"Hi, Rikka-chan!" He said as he made his way to me.
"I made pancakes for you! Kou-kun helped me, too!" as I said that, his smile turned into a deep scowl.
"You should thank her." said a third voice from behind.
Juuzou rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah."
Trying to break the awkward silence that fell over them, I said, tugging his sleeve, "Come to eat some pancakes! Before, you, Kou and I will go to the summer festival to see the fireworks!"
"Wait. We made plans only for the two of us!" Juuzou asked, stading still.
"Don't be such a pain, Juuzou. She's just only being kind." Kou said, venom in his voice.
