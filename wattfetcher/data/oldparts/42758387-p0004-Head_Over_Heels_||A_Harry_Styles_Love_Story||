Anne stands and gives me a hug, and Gemma does the same.
"I walk you home." Harry says, rising from his chair. I smile and nod. We walk out the door and walk to my house in silence.
"Thank you for walking me. Your mom and sister seem lovely." I say.
"Yeah. Um do you maybe want to go to dinner Friday? Only if you want to of course." He says nervously.
I feel my cheeks heat up. "I would love to."
We hug and I enter my house, waving slightly as I shut the door. When it closes, I lean my back against it and sink down to the floor with a smile on my face.
I get up and run upstairs to my room. After changing into sweatpants and a hoodie, I throw my hair into a messy bun. I lay down on my bed an turn on my tv.
Glancing out my balcony doors, I can see Harry's house. I look closely as I see somebody move in the room. The curtains open and reveals Harry, looking up at the night sky smiling. Yeah, I had stayed at Harry's until it was dark. Whoops. I giggle and open the door. I walk out onto the balcony and lean on the railing.
"Hey Harry!" I yell.
He look over at me and smiles.
"Hey!"
"Goodnight! See you tomorrow!" I yell, and go back into my room as he waves. I close my doors, locking them and fall onto my bed.
Oh my God. I think I am falling for Harry Styles.
No no no no. I can't be. We just met. But yet, every time I am around him, my heart leaps for joy. I sigh, and turn of my tv and lights. I crawl under my covers and drift off to sleep, with a green-eyed, curly-haired boy on my mind..
