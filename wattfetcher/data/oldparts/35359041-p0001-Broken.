Every one talks about how terrible it is to hear their mother cry over their father. but you know what really is terrible? when your mother is a raging alcoholic who cheated on your idiot father 5 times. The pain in your heart you feel when you see your mother laughing in your father's face, at his tears, pain, brokenness. It's indescribable. When your own mother can look you and your father in the eyes and laugh at the fact she's ruining you and your father. How she can look in your eyes and laugh knowing she's the reason for the cuts on your arm. Knowing she's the reason you cry 'till 2 AM. But as long as you have a bottle in your hand right mom? No. Fuck you. for breaking my Daddy's heart.
