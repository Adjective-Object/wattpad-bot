Kharisma's POVHi, I'm Kharisma. Kharisma Lilic. I'm 16 this year. I was living in Singapore before moving to California. My mom was a Singaporean while my dad is a Canadian. I am the eldest among all my siblings. I have to two brothers who also happens to be a pair of twins. Their names are Kol and Kasper. Kol was a few minutes older than Kasper. They are both 14. ((A/N there's cursing somewhere in this story so be prepared))
