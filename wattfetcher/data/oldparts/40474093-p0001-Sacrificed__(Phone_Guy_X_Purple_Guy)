Vincent P.O.VI got this job. I have the night shift at this stupid place called Freddy Fazbears pizza. And I have to share the shift with 4 other people.Fritz.Mike.Jeremy.And.... Wait, I actually don't know the name of the other one but what I do know is something stood out about him. Yeah...okay don't judge me.Everyone just called him Phone Guy.Anyway,So I walked into my new retarded job."Hey, I'm new to the night shift." I said as I came in the door.There was a fifth guy there, it must have been the boss."Welcome!" Mike said sarcastically."Try not to die." He muttered under his breath.The manager gave Mike a look that said if you say that again your dead."Oh!" He corrected himself."I mean it's really fun working with us." I shrugged and looked around."Who are you?" I asked as my eyes locked on this one guy."My name....well, my name is Phone Guy....at least that's what they call me." He responded."What's yours?" "Mines Vincent." I responded shyly.
"Why do they call you the Phone Guy?" I asked him trying not to be mean.
"I give the messages... So I tell new workers what to do and how to operate everything." Phone Guy told me.
"Cute..." I say."What?" He asks in astonishment."I-I mean cool...yeah...cool." I said quickly.
We both just stood there blushing like CRAZY. I put a hand over my face so he wouldn't notice."I-I think your really c-" phone guy was about to say something before Mike cut in.
"Alright! Ew...enough flirting and more working." Mike said."Your 2 are working in the office together tonight."
Phone Guy looked at me and I looked at him. He gave me a half smile.
"Well don't just stand there...GET IN THE OFFICE!" Mike yelled and started pushing us.This is going to be a fun night. I thought to myself.
