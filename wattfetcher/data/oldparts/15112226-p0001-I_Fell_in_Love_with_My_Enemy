Two 18 year olds (Austin Moon & Ally Dawson) that hated each other and where complete opposites that were always yelling, screaming, and fighting with each other and they were partners for music. The only thing they had in common was there best friends (Trish De la rosa & Dez Worthy) and music. One day they had to write a love song for a concert and the only way they could do that is to spend time with each other and try to get alone to write a love song. They start hanging out and soon enough they start falling for each other!
