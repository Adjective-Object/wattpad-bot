"excuse me miss?! i would like to inform you your bill---" meghan cuts off the waiter.
"im so sorry, my wallet is missing" meghan was loudly crying and im just there reading the newspaper but im kinda laughing inside because i miss her so much.
"your bill was payed by the guy there in table 9 wearing a checkered black and white long sleeves miss. thank you"the waiter continued his sentence.
meghan stops crying and she went towards me but she cant see my face yet, she looks so beautiful the day i met her until now!
"excuse me? i dont know you but i promise i will pay you my bill when i find my wallet"
"is this it?" i showed her her wallet with red lips and she was shocked as i put down the news paper and finally she saw my face.
"OMG!"
"hi meghan"
i dont know but while looking at her, i think im inlove again, she looks beautiful with those perfect curves and those attractive and luscious thin red lips. but what is happening? why did she ran away? isnt she happy to see me?i missed her.
