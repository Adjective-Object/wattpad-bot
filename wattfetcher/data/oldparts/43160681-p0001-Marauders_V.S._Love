James Potter, The leader. Sirius Black, the funny best friend. Remus Lupin, the nerd. Peter Pettigew, the tag along. Lily Evans, the know-it-all. Zaria Davidson, the one who has real courage. These are the heroes of our story.
Our story begins at a wizarding school in England. This particular wizarding school is very famous, for it was the greatest in all the land. The school was known as Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Now, our heroes weren't always friends. They were mostly separated. It started out with just the four boys, then lily tagged along. Our story will include difficulty and stress between these six. Not only will they become friends, but some of them will become something more.
"Sirius, wake up!" James Potter was trying to wake his best friend, Sirius Black, so they could cause mischief. You may ask, why do they do this? Because mischief is their middle names.
Eventually Sirius woke up and was immediately dragged under James' Invisibility cloak. James dragged poor Sirius through the portrait hole and down to the dungeons.
"Prongs, why are we going to the dungeons?" Sirius asked. James looked at Sirius as if he should know. When he didn' get an answer he mumbled "Zaria"
Sirius and James could hear voices. When they could hear them clearly, they stopped and leaned against the wall.
"A-and you won't tell anyone?" It was a boys voice. One they could not recognize.
"No Charles. I won't tell anyone. I promise."
They heard footsteps getting louder. They smashed themselves against the wall even more. Soon enough, Zaria and a first year boy walked by. Zaria stopped.
"You head back to the common room. I'll meet you there." The boy, Charles, nodded and walked off. Zaria turned and walked the way she had came. The boys followed behind her quietly. She turned a corner and headed up the stairs. Eventually they ended up at the kitchens.
" Why do you think she's goin' to the kitchens mate?" Sirius said.
"She's not. Look." James was right. For Zaria passed the kitchensÂ  and opened a portrait to reveal a secret tunnel. Zaria climbed into it and the boys followed. They heard voices again.
"So, my dear Zaria, you are late. Where have you been?" It was a voice they both recognized as Sirius' cousin. Narcissa Black.
"I had to help the first year Charles. He was out at night and got lost. Sorry." Zaria actually sounded like she was a nice person. But both James and Sirius knew she was not.
"You were supposed to be here at midnight! You filthy little-"
"Watch it Bellatrix. I brought some friends though." Zaria turned and pulled off the invisibility cloak so that they could now see the boys.
"Oh what pleasure! My dear cousin and his little friend!" Bellatrix said.
"Why are they here?" Andromeda Black asked.
"They followed me. So I decided to give them a little treat." Zaria had a sly grin on her face.
"What is wrong with you? What did we ever do to you?!" Sirius yelled at Zaria. Zaria grabbed is chin and forced him to look at her.
"That my dear Sirius, will be told when the time comes."
