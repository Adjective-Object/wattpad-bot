I thought he was my father, i trusted him, anf now he didn't care, he didn't save me from that car crash, now that i think of it, that wasn't an accident, that was my successful suicide. He betrayed me, i crumbled the papers together in anger, got to my knees and cried, i never felt so broken until know, i heard the door creek open but i ignored it and sobbed,
Bloody Red, i heard Smile dog called and i felt paws on my shoulder, when he came close to me i now know where that smell of fear and nervousness came from.Get Slender Man!, my voice was demonic as ever more like Broken red's voice, demonic and ruspy, after i said that hethen he whimpered and i felt his paws going out of the room, i felt Slender man walked my way, now i smelled the whole fear and nervousness,
Krewella?, i heard Slender man called my name, how did he knew my real name, how.how.How do you know my real name slendy?!, i said and faced him, if slender man had a face, he would be shock and can see there were definitely hurt and furious in my watery eyes,K-krewella, he stuttered, I don't care how powerful you are. You're keeping a secret from me. AND I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE BIT!!, i said standing up and throwing him the crumbled paper,
Please tell me the truth, i said looking down and while he reads the papers, my voice was back to normal and cracked, Krewella, he called and i looked up at him with tears in my eyes,I am...the one responsible for your recent..love life, he said that made me furious,What. I said cluching my fist,Lost Silver....and smile dog.....I told them to love you, he said,Why!, i said running to him and slapping him, i backed away and there was a red mark on him cheek,WHY!. I shouted,CAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE AFRAID OF NOT FINDING YOUR LOVE LIFE!, he yelled,WELL YOU MADE IT WORST!. WORST!., i yelled getting my axe and running out of the room.I ran far from the Slender Manor, i stopped and sat on top of a tree branch, i wipe my tears away, and sob, i hugged my knees and cried more," I've been betrayed a lot, and it really hurts to loose my trust,", i thought and felt another body behind me, hugging me, i looked up and there was a man, who had shiny crimson red hair that was up, white skin, red orbs, he only wore a black jacket, black jeans, black boots, and gloves.He wiped my tears away with his thumb and smiled at me,Ssshhhhhhh it's alright Krewella, he said while stroking my hair, he turned me around to face him and hugged me,Such soft and beautiful hair, he complimented while stroking my hair more, that made me smile, i look up at him and he smiled, then he pressed his lips on mine, his lips were cold as eyes, he stroked my thigh that made me gasp and gave him a chance to slip his cold tongue into my mouth, he tasted like blood, we pulled apart then he started kissing my neck, and run his hands to my thighs, i then snapped out of reality and push him off me, when i pushed him off me he disappeared, that made me thought of the past, i'm not going to playef anymore, i thought and jumped down from the branch, i put my hands in my jacket packet and walked back to the Slender Manor.
