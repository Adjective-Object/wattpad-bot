This story is set in a time period without modern technology.
It was the eve of the blood moon, and a ferocious thunder storm had hit. Lightning striking every 10 minutes, edging ever closer to the Redfern household.
"KAITLYN!!" Lewis shouted as he ran inside out of the storm.
Kaitlyn screamed in agony as the baby was on its way.
Draco, their two year old son, was sat in the corner crying. Unable to comprehend why his mother was crying and screaming.
"I... It's coming!" Kaitlyn yelled
"I know I know. Don't worry Kaityln, the doctor is on his way"
A few minutes passed and the doctor had arrived and rushed over to Kaityln to help her deliver her child.
.....
A few hours had passed and the clock struck midnight. And then, the child was born.
"It's a girl!" The doctor smiled. He cleansed up the child and handed her to Kaitlyn.
Kaitlyn looked down and smiled and the beautiful newborn cradled in her arms.
"What shall we call her?" Lewis asked
"Skarlet. Skarlet Krystal Redfern"
Little did they know that the birth of this child could mean the complete resurrection of humanity, or total extinction.
