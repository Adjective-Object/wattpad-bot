The flame in the heartOf a soulless beastWill never be fed;Not after a feast
Your handsAround it's neckSuffocation-It's bound to check
Stare into it's eyesWonderin' whyThis ugly beastJust won't die
The things in my headFill me with hateHumor:My most disguising trait
See right through cloakFilled with disgust"Just another bloke,"Then you do what you must
Break the possible?Go all out?I need to thinkSo I don't shout
Only time will tell,Well isn't that swell?I've waited yearsAnd I have just fell
Like a building Trapped in flamesI will fall down'cause I'm tired of these games
Look into my eyesTell me it's trueThere's no wayThat I deserve you
Sometimes it's easySometimes it's notAll the whileIt's all I've got
Cold as iceHard as stoneThese walls are hard,Hard as these bones
My heart is chainedMy mind is trapped You contain the keyBut I won't be stopped
Nails in my eyesFingers in my throatI think it's 'bout timeWe sunk this boat
Like the TitanicI am bound to fallBut before I doI gotta make a call
No one is listenin'No one can careWith youAll the pain I share
Smile and laughIt's all I doSo you won't look at meAnd see the shit I've been through
I hope you knowThat I do love youEyes sharp as glassYet soft and brass
All these temptationsThey're in my headAndI just can't take 'em
What do I do?Where do I go?I can't take itSend me home
It's in my blood This faithful crapBut in the endIt's all a trap
Don't look at meDon't look at my eyes'Cause all you'll seeIs pain and demise
You are my drugI am a bumI take it so muchSo I just go numb
Pain and demiseIt's all you'll seeSo don't do itDon't look into me
