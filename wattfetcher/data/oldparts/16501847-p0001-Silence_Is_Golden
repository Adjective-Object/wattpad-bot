As we sat aside the heated fireplace,
I began to gaze upon the sparkle in your eyes,
And It was at this moment I knew I had fallen in love with the wrong kind.
Everything was imperfectly perfect,
But my love for you was completely worth it.
I had known you felt the same,
But the fear of becoming an outcast left us a shame.
Growing up we were taught to love of those opposite,
But what if your heart leads you differently?
A single tear rolled down my cheek as I sat beside you holding you close,
Watching you watching me I knew this was meant to be.
Let's run away together, You & I,
Forget everything, Say a final goodbye,
If we are so to stay we will never be accepted,
People will make fun,
And we will be forced to run.
So let's run away together, You & I,
Are you willing to risk it all or are you too shy?
You and I are meant to be,
Unfortunately society would never see,
So please run away with me.
