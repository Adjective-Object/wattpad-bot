*End flashback*
I closed my eyes as I felt the electricity move around inside of me, like millions of never-settling snakes. I opened my closet door which I was now standing in front of. (Cue the suspense-building music.)
Behind my hoodies, polo shirts, dress pants, dress shirts, stood my very own superhero outfit. Built in shoes, mask, tight tights, everything it should have. No capes, I wasn't that clich√©. I felt the now familiar fabric in my hands, slightly rough on the outside but soft as silk on the inside. The black fabric held a lot of adventures, intertwined with my blood, sweat, and tears. Thin red lines ran everywhere on the suit. They were never still when I wore it, just like the bolts inside me. I slowly put my suit on, welcoming the excitement it gave me. Finally when all I had to put on was my mask, I looked in the mirror. All my muscles more defined, my suit looked good on me. I put on my mask, the black swallowing my head. My vision was now enhanced by the red tinted eye protection.
Yeah, I'm different. And it beats your different anyday. But this is who I am, and I embrace that.
I am a superhero. I am a superqueer. I am a superfreak. I am a superadoptee.
And I am the best person at being all of these super things.
