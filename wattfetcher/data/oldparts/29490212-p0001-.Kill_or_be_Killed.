I starting again with this story, so forgive me if you have been reading and maybe enjoyed my last story. But to be completely honest I wasn't satisfied with my writing it seemed extremely childish, but I'm going to write this to the best of my ability so I hope you enjoy! Alright let the ride begin :) thank you all.

Humans are shaped to fuck up from time to time, some more than most. And that's okay because there's an expression that simple explains that reason, and it's "you're only human" which automatically makes those "mistakes" appropriate in society. I completely comprehend this idea that we are a flawed species, that God already that we were born to fuck up.
But it's quite hard to grasp the concept that humans would trump over other to gain power, and power leads to practically anything and anyone. So I guess it's quite understandable why people would go to such extreme lengths for it.
Maybe it's probably because I want to be ignorant to the fact that the word murder or death are even vocabulary term or than people kill others for personal gain, even if that means having collateral damage. But I suppose I can't judge, its natural selection which is instinct to the flight or fight response. In the end only one thing remains in my mind at all moments each day I'm alive "Kill or be killed".
