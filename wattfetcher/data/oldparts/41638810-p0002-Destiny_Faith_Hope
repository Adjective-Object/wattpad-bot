"Who is that." She says, pointing to Nick.
"Destiny, go inside." I say, pointing to my front door, then she goes back inside. "There, you saw her." I say to Nick.
"She's incredible. She got so big in just five years."
"Yeah yeah, I get it. Her bright blue eyes got brighter and bluer. Her brown hair got longer and more brown. And she still has my face, I get it." I say. "And now you can go."
"Fine. I'll go. Thanks for letting me see her." He says, then leaves. After he's gone, I finish cleaning up the backyard, then go inside to join my daughter.
"Hey." I say, then sit next to her on the floor, by her toys. "School tomorrow, sweetie. Are you excited for more school?" I ask. She was in kindergarten, and she is very smart for her age.
"No. I wanna stay home with you mommy."
"I'm sorry, Destiny. But-"
"Is Nick my daddy?" Destiny says, cutting me off.
"No, where would you get such an idea?" I reply.
"Because he said so."
"What? When? Where?"
"Yesterday at the park he said I was his daughter and even though you and Patrick are kissing and are in love I was his daughter. So is he?"
"No, Destiny."
"Then who is he?"
"A very mean man that doesn't like it when he doesn't get what he wants." I say whilst dialing his number.
"Hello?"
"Really Nick? You followed me to the park where my daughter plays just to tell her something that isn't even true? She has a big enough struggle without you telling her a shit ton of lies! Patrick is her father whether you like it or not." I say, walking into the living room. "I slept with Patrick. Not you, and you need to understand that Patrick is her father! Goodbye Nick." I say, then hang up without letting him defend himself.
"Mommy? Why did you yell?"
"Because Nick is a meanie and doesn't want me to be happy. Patrick is your dad, okay?"
"Okay, thank you mommy." Then she runs off to her room to play. I still cannot believe I had her, even after five years. She looks so perfect.
