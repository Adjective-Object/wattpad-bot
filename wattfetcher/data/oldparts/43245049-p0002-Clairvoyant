"Do what we do best kill her"
The hunter turned the girl onto her back so all she could see was the nights sky; and all she could feel was the rain hitting her face making her cold, this is it she thought this is where it all ends. And for what a life I didn't even choose; the man looked right into her eyes and all he could see was fear but he didn't care, and so he plunged the knife into her heart, watching her life bleed out before him and her cries for help getting quieter and quieter. Then life left her, her eyes glowed a bright blue and a blue cloud of smoke left her mouth, and then she was dead. The man didn't feel guilty or feel any remorse; instead he felt happy that he had fulfilled his duty.
The hunter stood up leaving her there and walked away, this was his job and it needed to be stopped but there was enough people to do it. It was war between the girls kind and the hunters, but the hunters were winning and fast. Meanwhile all the other side could do was watch, watch their kind die.
"The clairvoyant girl is dead she won't be troubling us no more" he spoke into the walkie talkie as he made his way out of the graveyard, leaving the dead girl there forgotten....
