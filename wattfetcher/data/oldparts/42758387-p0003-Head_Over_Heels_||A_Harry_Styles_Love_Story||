"What?"
"So what do you think about Harry?" She asks, smirk remaining on her face.
"What do you mean? He is very nice." I say, feeling the heat creep up on my face.
"You like him, don't you?" She whispers.
"What? Pshhh. No. We just met."
"Mhmm. Okay." She says, not convinced. I playfully hit her and turn my head to Harry.
"Harry, Kinsey and I are hanging out this weekend, would you like to join us? We can invite Josh and Emma over, too."
"Okay. I'm shore that will be okay." He smiles.
"Its settled then. I will text you my address later."
*********
The rest of the day flew by. Turns out, I have about 5 of my classes with Harry. I walk to my car, getting in and starting it. When I pull up to my house a few minutes later, I see there is a moving truck at the house next door.
Odd, I thought. That house has been empty for ages.
I walk into the house and see that my mom is still yet to be home, so I walk over to the neighbor's house.
I knock on the door and am greeted by a woman looking to be in her early 40s. She has dark brown, almost black, hair and brown eyes.
"Hello, love." She greets me. "Is there something I can help you with?"
"Oh no. I was just coming by to say welcome to the block. I live next door." I smile.
"Mum, who is at the doo- Maddie?" I look behind the woman and see Harry.
"Oh. Hey, Harry." I smile.
"Harry, you know her?" His mom asks.
"Yeah, she goes to my school. We met this morning. Maddie, this is my mum, Anne." He says kindly.
"Hello, Anne. Very nice to meet you. I'm Maddie."
"Hello dear." She smiles.
"Maddie, didn't you say your mum worked at the same hospital my mum got a job at?"
"Oh yes. ETMC Athens? That's the place. My mom is a doctor there." I inform Anne.
"Oh yes. What is your mum's name love?"
"Jennifer. Jennifer Johnson."
"Oh yes! Dr. Johnson. I met her today while I went in to tour around the hospital. Lovely lady, she is."
"Maddie, would you like to come in? Maybe have a cup of tea?" Harry asks.
"That sound wonderful." I smile. I enter the house and follow Harry and Anne into the kitchen.
"You have a lovely home."
"Why thank you." Anne smiles.
Harry, Anne, and I sit at the kitchen table just having small talk and sipping tea, when I hear the door open.
"Mum! I'm home!"
"In the kitchen, Gem!"
A girl with brown/blonde hair walks in. She looks about 25.
"Oh. Hello." She smiles.
"Gemma, this is Maddie. Maddie, this is my sister, Gemma." Harry says. We exchange smiles and I stand up.
"Thank you for having me. I better get home. Mom should be back soon." I announce.
