Lucille's POV
"Bye Belle" I said to my coworker, as i hung my apron up on the wall. As i walked outside, i could feel
the breeze hit my face. It felt good. I started my nightly walk routine home. As usual I was ending my 10
o clock night shift at Yummy's Cafe. I hated walking alone in the dark, but what could i do?,  me and my
my mother only owned one car. And most of the time she needed it for her work at the office. It sucked.
Through my night walk, I've seen a drunk man pee on a fire hydrant and i even caught a couple doing it
in the alley. Ew. How public can people get with those things? At least i havent been robbed or
killed yet. See, I live with my mother. My father died when I was 10 after a drunk driver hit him. Ever since, it has
just me and my mother. We moved down to California after my father's death. My mother got a job
offer and seeing that she couldnt cope with his death, my aunts and uncles decided it was best for
us to move down to California. It sucks when all your family members live in a whole differen state from you.
It sucks not knowing many people here. I've always had a  hard time making friends, and so ever since our move down here, 7
years ago.,Ive kept a distance from many people. My best friend April also lived thousands of miles
where my family members were.
Checking the time, i tried to hurry home. But then i saw a shadow in front of me. He was pointing
something at me. He got closer and closer. It was a knife. I guess that whole part about not getting
robbed or killed was too fast, huh?
I stayed still, frightened. And this is the reason why i hated walking home alone.
"Please dont hurt me!" I cried out.
"Give me your money" I just stared at him.
"I said, give me your money!" He said as he walked closer to me pointing the knife with him. I kept
backing away.
"Okay, okay.  Please dont hurt me..." I said as i hurriedly searched for my
money. My hands were shaking, i couldnt concetrate. All i could think of was what if he kills
me? My mother would be alone. No, she wouldnt be okay. No, she needed me.
I couldnt find my money, but i found my pepper spray that i kept with me at all times. I bought one for
moments like this. I mean in dark alleys, you never know what's going to happen.
"I cant find it!"
He looked angry. "Dont lie to me!"
"Give me your bag!" He came closer to me and pulled my bag. I couldnt let him have it. No, i
couldnt. Me and him played a tug a war with my bag until i took my pepper spray and sprayed him
with it.
"OW! You B****! " He said covering his eyes. He kept rubbing his eyes and now he was charging
towards me with the knife. Maybe i shouldnt have done that. For some reason, i couldnt move my legs, they froze.
I was scared for my life. All of sudden a tall figure came out from the dark and charged him to the ground.
