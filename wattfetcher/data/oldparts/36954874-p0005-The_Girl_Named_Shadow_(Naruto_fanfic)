"Yeah!"
"Hn." Take a guess (because I love the take a guess things).
They were done with all 30 required D-Ranks in record time.
"Alright Gramps, we've done all our D-Ranks!" Naruto said with a closed-eye smile.
"Wha- How? It normally takes weeks!" Iruka stammered.
"It's because I'm with them." Shadow stated coolly.
"Alright, then, I guess I have no choice but to give you a C-Rank. Send in the client." The Hokage sighed. A man stumbled in, holding a bottle of sake.
"Hey, what's this? Genin? Am I really supposed to trust that midget with the idiotic look on his face?"
Naruto laughed. "Hey, who's the midget with the idiotic look on his face..." We lined and and Naruto attacked the dude, realizing he was the shortest.
Shadow sighed and immobilized him with shadows. "Naruto... we can't protect the client if he's dead."
"Why would I want to protect him?" Naruto shouted. "He called me a midget!"
"I have ears, Naruto." Shadow said, sweatdropping. "I heard."
"Naruto." Sasuke began. "People have called you much worse. Why do you react now?"
Naruto paused, thinking. What a shocker.
"I dunno." He shrugged. Shadow let him go, stepping toward the door.
"Hold up." Kakashi called. "We'll meet at the entrance to the village in one hour. Don't be late."
"Oh, that's rich, coming from you." Shadow muttered, before disappearing into the shadows.

"Alright!" Naruto cheered. "I'm out of the village! I'm finally a traveler!"
Shadow patted him on the head fondly. "You're one step out of the village, Naru-kun. I don't think that qualifies as a traveler."
Naruto ran ahead. "How 'bout now?" He yelled back. Shadow laughed, then covered her mouth with the back of her hand in shock. She couldn't even remember the last time she had laughed. Smirked, definitely. All the time. Smile, once or twice. Grin, only around her friends. But laugh? What were these two boys doing to her?
"What's wrong?" Sasuke asked.
Shadow shook her head. "It's nothing, just... I can't remember the last time I've laughed. I don't think I've ever laughed, actually."
"I can't remember the last time I've laughed, either." Sasuke admitted. "Definitely not since the Uchiha Massacre."
Shadow stopped and looked at him.
"What?" He asked.
Shadow sighed. "Sasuke... there's something you need to know."
"What?" Sasuke asked, getting angry.
Shadow held her hand in the wolf seal and suddenly everything went black.

"Where are we?" Sasuke asked, looking around. They were in a field, dotted with flowers. Shadow sat down, crosslegged.
"My dimension." She said. "Sit down... we've got a lot to talk about."
"What do you mean?" Sasuke demanded, sitting down.
"Itachi is not at fault for his actions." Shadow replied coolly, anticipating Sasuke's reaction. Sure enough, he exploded.
