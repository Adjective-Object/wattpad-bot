I sit there just looking at this girl sing and play the guitar while she gets the crowd behind her moving with her moderate paced rhythmic sway a long of the guitar as she played. I need to at least try to talk her into at least thinking about signing a contract the crowd was literally eating out of the palm of her hand. After her performance I try to walk back stage the new security guard won't let me. So I had to show him my I.d. It was a good thing that this time I had brought it with me this time. But not before I get a chance to tell her what I do for bands like her roadrunner records would fall in love with her voice.
I walk to the backstage area to see what was this woman's name nobody knew where she even came from and the word is that nobody knows her name. That part concerns me but I will soon find out her name as soon as the band leaves the backstage area and out of the door. Three hours later after the stage lights are off and the bar is closing down she leaves the dressing room. The entry way would be a normal leave to the night as anyone would be doing after they have just performed at the pinwheel bar hungry for more. The sudden stop was just a little intense but nothing out of the ordinary I interrupt her sudden walking I greet her with a tip of my fedora. How do you do my name is David Morris I am a contract signer looking for talent to bring to fame short sweet and to the point I am wondering if you're interested in a contract with roadrunner records.
It was then the girl in white asks the band to wait in the Van and take the instruments with you I need to speak with this person alone. So my friend you are with roadrunner records you say I kid you not My bosses want me to sign contracts for new bands looking to make a name for themselves. When I heard on stage tonight I immediately thought you would be perfect for an Eleven album contract. In which case are you interested in signing a contract with us for a studio album? She smiles at me good Lord even her smile fulfill my idea of a good natured woman.
Mind if we talk in the Micro bus she lightly laughs don't worry you won't be kidnapped or anything I usually like to business their. Oh uh okay oh god I love micro buses there just so awesome to drive and they have such a history with my favorite genre of people hippies. I love a little peace power My auntie was one, my brother is one, some my best friends are hippies. It's what made me get into the nasty and wild world of record contract signing. Rock and jazz music are just one of the things that is just like crack to me heavy metal, punk rock, electric rock, liquid metal, and deep house jazz are one of the things that just speak to me.
We made our way into the micro bus and just sat there as she rips this question: "So what made you so interested in our band Mr. Contract signer? Please don't say just the band!"
Me: well to be honest it's your voice that is just so powerful and the bassist played with a passion like fire and you on the guitar is just so fitting but your voice is better than any instrument that is why I'm interested.
She: Well you certainly have a way with words Mr....?
Me: Mr. David Morris is the name but you can call me David.
She: Well what if I told you to check out our next show in Manhattan what would you say then Mr. Morris.
Me: I'm there that is what I would say unless that wasn't an invite to hear you sing again.
She: believe that was an honest and I hope to see you in our next show Mr. David Morris and I hope to see you at Jamie's on Seventh St. In Manhattan your gonna love the show.
As I leave the micro bus feeling confident in myself I contact my bosses about what happened the conversation is as follows. Yo Faye I smile she doesn't know the embarrassment that she is about to receive over this phone.
Hey tomorrow will be the first time reviewing the band's next performance in Manhattan where are you at Faye?
