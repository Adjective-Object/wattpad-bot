voice casual. "No idea who he is."
He stands, and finally I see his face. He wears dark sunglasses and his mouth is bent into a snarl.
His cheek is rippled with scars, like his hands. He leans close to my face. His breath smells like
cigarettes. Not real, I remind myself. Not real.
"You're lying," he says. "You're lying!"
"I am not."
"I can see it in your eyes."
I pull myself up straighter. "You can't."
"If you know him," he says in a low voice, "you could save me. You could save me!"
I narrow my eyes. "Well," I say. I set my jaw. "I don't."
I WAKE TO sweaty palms and a pang of guilt in my chest. I am lying in the chair in the mirrored room.
When I tilt my head back, I see Tori behind me. She pinches her lips together and removes electrodes
from our heads. I wait for her to say something about the test-that it's over, or that I did well,
although how could I do poorly on a test like this?-but she says nothing, just pulls the wires from my
forehead.
I sit forward and wipe my palms off on my slacks. I had to have done something wrong, even if it
only happened in my mind. Is that strange look on Tori's face because she doesn't know how to tell
me what a terrible person I am? I wish she would just come out with it.
"That," she says, "was perplexing. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
Perplexing?
I bring my knees to my chest and bury my face in them. I wish I felt like crying, because the tears
might bring me a sense of release, but I don't. How can you fail a test you aren't allowed to prepare
for?
As the moments pass, I get more nervous. I have to wipe off my hands every few seconds as the
sweat collects-or maybe I just do it because it helps me feel calmer. What if they tell me that I'm not when finally. tori came back she told me Im divergent kust like my brother and she told me to go home and tell my parents I got sick so i did.
