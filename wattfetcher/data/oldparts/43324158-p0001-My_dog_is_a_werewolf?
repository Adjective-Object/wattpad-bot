"Xavier get your butt here now!"my sister Abigail yells, "alright,alright it only takes 10 minutes to get this good"i say and give her a wink "oh i so wish you weren't my brother"he mumbles. "MUM IM GETTING A DOGGGGGGGGGGGGGGYYYYY!"i tell childishly "fine but your looking after the mutt"mum says and walked upstairs.
I walk in the shop and wanted to get a dog. I looked at all the dogs and none took my fancy "would you like to see our biggest dog?"the lady asked "uh yeah sure"i said and followed her to a room. It was a room with metal or something everywhere on the wall. "This is our wolf/husky,she was hit by a car and is short tempered. We hope that her owner will calm her down"the lady said,when I got eye contact with the dog I loved her already,she started to stop running around and sat in front of the cage. "Looks like she likes you"the lady said and I bought the wolf. "Ok wolf I'll call you Lucy?"i asked she growled "Nicole?"she seemed to like that name, "ok Nicole I need to put this muzzle on you incase you try to bite me. Wait am I talking to a wolf that can't understand humans?"i asked myself ad Nicole kinda chuckled. ------Hey so my first chapter on this book. YES I KNOW IT SUCKS!
