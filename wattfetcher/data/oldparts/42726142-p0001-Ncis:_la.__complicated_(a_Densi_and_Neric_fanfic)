HUGE spoilers for Descent and Ascension. Need to have seen both episodes first for it to make sense ......... I own none of the characters.Kensi povStupid! Stupid! Stupid!He'd finally done it. Deeks had kissed me! Wrong time? Sure. Wrong place? Definitely! But he'd put every unspoken word, every screwed up emotion between us into that kiss and what had I done? I ran!Just like I ran every single time things got complicated or difficult.I just left him standing there as I hopped on my bike and drove away! I spent my entire life building up walls, keeping people at arms length and yet with one kiss, Deeks had broken down every last one of them.
Deeks povWhat have I done?I've just ruined anything me and Kensi had in the space of a few seconds!I let my feelings get the better of me and she couldn't even look me in the eyes. It hurts me to even think that I messed up so badly!Why then, of all times, did I have to show her how I felt? In the middle of the case. With hundreds of thousands of lives on the line! Sidorov had the nuclear bombs ready to sell to Iran.I should have just waited, but it happened, it's done.I made the first move. Now it's her turn.
No one povDeeks was still deep in his thoughts when a splash came from down below! He looked down just in time to see Sam thrown into the water with the case of gold still handcuffed to his arm. It was holding him down as the air escaped from his lungs.Deeks through himself into the water, unlocking the handcuffs and dragging sam's body up to the surface. He tried to fight as both he and Sam were dragged away by sidorov's men.
Back in OPSCallen pov"We have lost all contact with Mr Deeks and Mr Hanna." Hetty spoke calmly as she looked at me and Kensi. I kept my tone as gentle as possible as I turned to Kensi, pacing back and forward on the floor"We'll get them back Kens!" She gave me an uneasy smile and nodded slightly, clearly trying to mask her panic.It was hardest for her out of all of us! I mean, Sam was like a brother to me and yet, Deeks had always been something more to Kensi. Not that she would ever admit it.
"Miss Blye ... Miss BLYE!" Hetty yelled, making Kensi snap out of her trance like state.Eric and Nell tensed in the corner as Hetty raised her voice."I understand that you are worried for Mr Deeks but you need to stay with Michelle!"Kensi sighed as she walked out of OPS."Kensi's really taking this hard." I said as I turned to face Hetty She let out a little sigh of her own "We all are Mr Callen. But right now, our highest priority is protecting Michelle's cover and insuring the 2 nuclear bombs don't fall into the hands of Iran!" With that she stormed out.Nell looked at me apologetically and Eric shrugged his shoulders slightly as I followed Hetty out of OPS.
Kensi povOh god oh god! "Ok Kensi, breathe!" I told myself! I had to stay focused on the case! I couldn't help my thoughts drifting back to Deeks. Our stupid childish banter, ridiculous nicknames, arguing over the smallest of things. But most of all, the love I saw in his eyes when he kissed me.
"Stop it!" I muttered to myself as I smacked myself over the head. " Deeks is just your partner!" But even I had stopped believing those words a long time ago. I thought about the pain he could be going through by now, the torture. I gritted my teeth. I should be trying to find him, trying to help him somehow, and yet I was stuck here in this bloody car. I punched the dash board and shook my fist as pain seared through my knuckles!
"Shit!" I moaned under my breath. "Buzz buzz" I grimaced as I glanced down at my phone, not entirely sure if it was out of pain or just anger as I saw the name 'Hetty' pop up. I took a composing breath and answered"Yes Hetty" I said through bared teeth."Something seems off Miss Blye. Go in!" "On it." I said as I pulled open the door and ran into the building where Michelle had been taken.
