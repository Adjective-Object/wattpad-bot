Stormy POV
Today is my birthday!!! I finally turn into to my wolf! Sorry my name is Stormy Tulip Anderson and I am turning 17. I woke up and stripped down and got in the shower. I wash my body and shaved everywhere. I hop out the shower and grabbed my dark blue lace bra and my matching panties. I put them on and grabbed a black crop top and some floral shorts and I put those on. I put red lipstick and mascara then I grabbed my black combat boots and my phone. I went downstairs to see my mom wasn't there but on the table was a note.
Sorry honey, I was late but happy birthday I won't be home tonight so here is some money.Love,Mom
Of course, as always. I took a banana and walked out the door. I got into my jeep and went to pick up my BFF, Lena. We have been friends since we were in diapers. I parked up on the driveway and texted her.
Lea out on the driveway - StormyI will be there in a minute - Lena I put my phone away and she came out the door. She got into the car and hugged me. "Happy birthday BFF" Lea giggled. "Thanks" I said. I drove us to school and parked into our regular parking spot. We got out and walked into the school and getting some "hey's and hi's" from the guys and girls. We walked to our lockers and when we went I smelt this most amazing smell. "Hey Stormy what's wrong" Lea asked worried. " I think I just found my mate" I said excited. So I followed to smell him, Marcus Fay.
