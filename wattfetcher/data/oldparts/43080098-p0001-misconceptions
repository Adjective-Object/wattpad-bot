"First day of school! Up and at 'em!"
"Fuck off, Gee."
"Aw, is baby Mikey sleepy?"
"I said fuck off, I'm trying to sleep."
"Jesus, fine. Don't blame me when you're late on your first day of eleventh grade."
"Believe me, I won't."
---------
"Did you eat breakfast, honey?"
"Yeah."
"What did you eat?"
"Mom, is this really pertinent to the matter at hand?"
"Is it a crime to want to know if my youngest son had a proper meal?"
"Well, if you must know, I had a waffle."
"With syrup?"
"Jesus Christ!"

"Welcome, everyone, to your first day back at Belleville High!"
"..."
"Oh! Almost forgot. We have a new student! Class, this is Mikey Way."
"...."
"Well, take a seat, Mr. Way."
"........"
"Is he not going to say anything?"
"I bet he thinks he's too good to even introduce himself."
"He's just a stuck-up rich kid."
Misconception #1.
"Hi, I'm Pete!"
"....?"
"Not much of a talker, huh? That's okay. I do most of my own talking anyway."
"Well... nice to meet you. I'm Mikey."
"Oh, trust me, I know."
Oh my god don't hate me I know this is so short but I just got the idea whoops
