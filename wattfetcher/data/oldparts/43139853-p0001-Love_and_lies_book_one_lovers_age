Hello my name is Allison. It's my first day here at chaos high. "Hello young woman"says the secretary. "Hello mrs uhh Clark" I reply . "Your Allison right?" Mrs Clark asks. " I nod. "Your in room 207." She says. I ran up the stairs and entered my class room. " your late." The teacher says dryly. I quickly sit down next to a guy who's kinda cute. "What's your name" i ask. "Damian, and yours?" "Allison" (30 minutes later) riiing! I walk out of the class room and accidentally crashed into a girl. "Oh hey, I'm Analysha" she says. "I'm Allison" your new here right? Yah I am. You know anyone? Just you, Damian and the teachers. Oh ok got to go. Analysha left the I looked for room 103. As I searched for the room a boy popped out. "Huh" I said as I was startled. "Sorry to scare you" he replied. "I'm heading to p.e." I said. he followed me. I started to blush. I couldn't help it. I felt weird around him I just don't know what it is.
