"You'll never get the puck into my net!" I told Alex. I was way better at street hockey than him, or hockey in general considering I play on Rose Lake High's varsity team as a freshman.
"Oh yeah?" He challenged as he shot the puck at my net, but I easily blocked it. I walked up to him and ruffled his brown hair.
"Oh yeah," I confirmed, a slight smirk on my face.
My brother, Spencer, walked outside and gave me an approving nod.
"Nice job little sis," he said.
"Thanks!" I smiled. The only reason I was so good at hockey was because of Spencer. He taught me everything I needed to know about hockey. Basically, I idolized him, and not just because he plays hockey but because he's an all around great person. Spencer's nice, funny, popular, and because I never had a dad, he became like a mini dad to me since he was four years older than me.
"I call having Spencer on my team," Alex half shouted.
"That's not fair! You guys would whip on me!" I countered.
Spencer laughed at Alex and I's argument. "You two can be on one team and I'll be on my own," he suggested.
So we went through with Spencer's idea, and I took my spot in the center.

"Frankie!" My mom called. "It's time for dinner!"
I groaned. Didn't Mom know I was watching the Indianapolis Indians play baseball? I slowly got up and walked into the kitchen. Spencer just finished setting the table for dinner.
"Sit down," Mom ordered. "We're having enchiladas."
"Alright. Alright. Let's hurry this up 'cause I've got a game to watch."
My mom sighed and rolled her eyes. "You know someday, Frankie, your life won't revolve around sports."
"Well that day isn't today. And tomorrow isn't looking good either," I said with a hint of sarcasm. "What do you want me to do, Mom? Wear so much make up that I look like Barbie? Curl or straighten my hair everyday? I'd kind of rather not be bald by the time I turn 30."
My mom sighed again. There was no point in arguing with her when she got that way, so I just took my spot at the table next to Spencer.
After Mom sat down for dinner, she popped the question that comes around everyear, and every year I dread it more and more. "So, sweetie, are you excited for your first day of High School tomorrow?"
"It's just another day of school. All the same people just a few different classes."
She chuckled. "You never get excited about anything. Spencer, are you excited for your first day as a Senior in High School?"
"Yeah."
"You kids are so nonchalant these days."
"You're just old fashioned, Ma," I joked.
"Just eat your enchilada."
After dinner, I went upstairs to the gaming room to play the Xbox, but I found myself unable to concentrate. Despite what I told my mom, I truly was nervous for my first day of High School. I only had one class with both of my best friends. I had classes with other people that I was friends with, but it isn't the same. I didn't want to grow apart from either of my best friends, Carter and Olivia.
Eventually, I went down the hall to my bedroom. I groaned when I realized it was 11 o'clock because in seven hours I would be waking up.
