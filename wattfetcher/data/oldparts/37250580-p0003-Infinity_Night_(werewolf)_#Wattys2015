"Its okay. Don't be. We're happy for him. He has need waitingbfor a girl like that for a long time now. I would've done the same if I were in his shoes." He gave me a reassuring smile. Once I spotted the door, I stopped.
"Good to know. I wish you, your band and him the best of luck. Hope everything goes well. Anyway, here's room 13." I point at the door at my right ride and he nods.

"Nathaniel, but everybody calls me Nate." He replied with a wide smile.
"Okay. Nice meeting you Nate!" I told him and turned around to head back to my desk.
"You too Gaby!" He called out and I turned around and waved at him to which he waved back.
