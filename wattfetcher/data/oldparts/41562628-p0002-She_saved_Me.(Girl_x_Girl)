I felt like a child awaiting their punishment. I backed up against the wall when I made eye contact with him. "You think you can just take take take from me?! Guess what! you gotta nother thing coming" He slurred. He was in my face now.
He took hold of my hair and threw me across the living room. My phone flew out of my pocket. The impact of the floor took the wind out of me. "S-sto" He didn't even let me finish what I was saying before he backhanded me. I couldn't help but cry out. "Oh! You don't like it when someone hurts you huh?!" He yelled over me. "I give you everything! Diamonds! A big house! I don't even make you work! But you say you are stressed! You don't deserve anything. You'll never guess what I found in your closet! Divorce papers?! What you thought I wouldn't find them?"There was a vain disappearing into his brown hair, which made him more horrifying. I just sat there on the ground not letting go of a single tear.
"Nothing to say bitch?"
He gave me four kicks to the stomach. Each one knocking more and more wind out of me. "When I wake up, you better have breakfast ready." With that I heard him stumble up the stairs.
I couldn't stand up, every time id try I would fall back into a ball.
After about ten minutes of wincing. I finally forced myself up off the ground.
I used whatever I could to keep my self up. I was walking with one hand on the wall until I reached the garage. I flinched as I slid into the Audi's seat. I started the car and tried to carefully drive.
I wasn't sure where I was going, I just wanted to get away from here. I found myself passing several open bars at this time at night. So I decided to stop at one.

I was on my sixth long island iced tea. Everything was already numb and blur. There was a nice lady sitting next to me. "You doin' okay?" She asked concerned. I chugged down my poison and nodded. I heard her giggle.
"Ya know? whats even the point of politicies...? Its like. Yeah obama is a pretty amazing guy. I would take his numberrr any year. Day? Same thing." I went on. Her soft giggling turned into chuckling. "What about Michelle?" She asked after sipping her drink. "Mi- Who? Mam! I need another one of these, but put extra alcohol and stuff!" I shouted across the bar. Gaining a few looks from some pervy men.
I felt my stomach sink a little bit. My blurry vision, started getting darker and darker with each second that went by. I felt myself leaning back on the bar stool and not being able to sit up right. I saw the stranger I was talking to look at me with concern, before it all went black.
