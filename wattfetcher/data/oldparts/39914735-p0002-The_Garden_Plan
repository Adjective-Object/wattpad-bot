We passed each other like the other didn't exist. Our shoulders didn't brush. Our eyes didn't make contact. There was no acknowledgement of the other's existence. I soon forgot about him after I entered my room. He probably did the same.
I just sat on my bed, my back against the headrest, eating Pocky and picking grapes out of the bag. Pocky was still a common snack, even after the end of World War III, which forced Japan to evolve into an even more Westernized version of what it was in the early 2000s. While Pocky was considered modern, other "modern" parts of Japan were confiscated. But I was born seven years after the war ended; I'd never lived any other way.
I finished eating at around 11:15, got a drink of water, and then went to bed.
"Went to bed". I lay under the covers, naked except for the jeans I'd worn the day before, for another hour and a half. This was unusual. Because no coherent thoughts surfaced, most of the time, I never stayed awake for too long. But something was wrong.
There was an itch in my brain that I couldn't reach. A thought was reaching out to me, trying to tell me something, but all the clutter got in the way and I couldn't make it out. I blamed it on the clutter.
The thought took forever to decode... but then I realized...
It was September 1st.
I stayed awake for much longer after that, without checking the clock, even though I knew I had scratched the itch just right. I didn't force myself to fall asleep; instead I just let my body go whenever it felt like it. It didn't matter when I woke up.
Why should I care about anything on my last few days alive?
