Hello, and welcome to this story. This was made a while back and I don't really love this story because of how cliche it is. Anyways, thanks for checking this out, and I hope you enjoy!
Okay, so this is a little bit about Christina, I will also be calling her Chris in the story.

All About Christina
Hi, I'm Christina, but all my friends and family call me Chris. I'm kind of a tomboy, just by the way I dress.
I am twelve years old, and I'm going to middle school in a couple of days. I. Am. Terrified.
I'm not shy or anything, I'm just anti-social. I don't really like talking to many people. It's my nature.
I have a couple friends, their names are Zack and Jonah.
Oops forgot something. I have a twin sister. She's a total girly girl. She wears makeup where ever she is, she doesn't care the time of day, she wears "fashionable" clothes (aka trendy), which make her look like she's an eighteen-year old.
Her and her friend Maribell come together and try to dress me up, but I never let them. They annoy the heck out of me.
I live with my mom and Cindy. My dad is at work in Texas. He's a doctor and he's our main source of money. He pays for all our food, the bills, everything all the way from Texas. It's very sad that he's not here all the time because I miss him a lot. He's the only one who would let me dress the way I want, do whatever I want. (Not drugs. Stay away from drugs kids!)
And... Yeah that's basically all about me.
