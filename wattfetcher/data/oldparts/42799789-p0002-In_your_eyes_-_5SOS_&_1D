I unlocked my phone and opened my twitter. OH. MY. GOD. I looked at the history and the pictures were of them...being...DUMB! There was one where they were pulling faces...and the worst one was them... just wearing boxers...EWWW! Then I saw the video.... them chanting "Sex, sex, sex!" to say I was embarrassed would be an understatement. Oh my god! They really need girlfriends...But of course who would want to date them they're such slobs and sometimes they forget I live with them and come downstairs only wearing their boxers. Once Louis forgot to put on boxers and came down the stairs while I happened to be eating with Harry and Niall. Long story short both Harry and Niall lectured him about nudity, especially around me seeing as how I happen to be the opposite gender, and Harry's - my overprotective brother - little sister.
"You guys!" I yelled, running after the laughing baboons.
I jumped on them and we tumbled down the stairs. I know, I really don't sound that safe, but I am, just not around them, since they tackle...everything.
By the time we got up, I had finished tickling Zayn because he was the only one who knew my password, and we were panting from the wrestling and whatnot.
"You like?" Niall asked, pointing at my phone.
"No." I said deleting the pictures and video, but laughing at them.
"Oh, you're lying, you loved it!" Liam said turning around and smacking his butt. Before he could stand up properly, I kicked his ass and he stumbled forward, the others giving me high fives.
"I love you so much." Harry said with a proud smile while giving me a kiss on the head.
Sometimes I think Harry only does that because he wants to embarrass me in front of the others, then again, we do act like a married couple â€“ minus the sleeping together and kissing on the lips. Just the thought of us being married makes me shiver.
"Tell me something I don't know." I said getting cocky, the others chanting "oohs" and "ahs", and then there's Niall saying "Oh! You just got told!"
