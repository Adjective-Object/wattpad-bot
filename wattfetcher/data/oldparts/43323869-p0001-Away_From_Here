Prologue
I stood in front of the tall, pearly-white building, adjusting the shoulder-straps of my rucksack.
It didn't look like Hell; but looks can be deceiving. High school? More like Hell School. I couldn't wait to leave; just one week and I could leave this hell hole, leave this facade of perfect American High School... I just had to survive one more week. Just seven days... What could go wrong? More like: what could possibly go right?

My name is Willow. Go on, laugh. I'm a freakin tree - How very observant of you. For the sake of traditional 'coming of age stories', let's just pretend I am just "an average 18 year old girl". Wow, this sounds cliche already. I live in Orlando. City of never ending tourists. Wonderful.
It's horrible.
Sure, for tourists it's great; you have tourist shops, tourist parks, tourist EVERYTHING. Then you have the rest of Orlando; not so tourist friendly. At least you get away from the harassing tourists though. Constant attacks of "Do you know the way to Downtown Disney" to which, my current favourite reply is "Well Second Star to the right and straight on till morning", only seconded by "Just follow the Yellow Brick Road" with a sarcastic glare. Some of them believe me. I guess I'm not 'tourist friendly'. Huh. Whatever that means.
