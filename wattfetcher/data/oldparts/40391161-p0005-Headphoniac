The lyrics of a heavy metal song went through my ear drums, and I turned it up even louder so that I wouldn't have to hear their conversation.

"They broke up, like, weeks ago, I heard," said a girl from my art class.
"And that Valerie went out with Derek right afterwards!" said the girl's friend. I quirked an eyebrow at their conversation and turned down the volume of my headphones to get a good listen of the spreading rumors, and acted like I wasn't listening.
"She got over Garrett fast, didn't she," said the girl.
"I don't even know why they broke up! They looked so great together!"
Look, I thought. Doesn't mean they are. Surprisingly, the same girls were close friends of Valerie's. At least, you'd think they were judging by the fact that they sit together, talk together, and do basically everything together. But when your 'friend' gets popular and rumors start spreading, you can't help but gossip about them.
I scribbled all over the blank page as they switched subjects. The ink sank nicely onto the page, creating that inky blackness that I liked. They continue talking about something on their phones. I roll my eyes and turn away from their conversation. People would believe anything they heard. I turned the volume back up until I couldn't hear anything else other than the music.
