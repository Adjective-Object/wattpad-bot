A/n thank you for even considering to read this it means a lot ðŸ’• leave requests and I will make them come true âœ¨~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Levi: ok listen up brats, we have a new member of the 104th trainees squad. her name is (y/n)(l/n)..
Everyone looked at you as you blush but they all have welcomed faces as you look around the mess hall.
Levi:so (l/n).. Go sit with all of the other brats and eat I'm sure you hungry
As you go to sit down you notice that everyone wants you to sit beside them in the end you sit beside Jean and Armin. you all talk for a while but Connie ruined the moment by saying...
Connie: so (y/n).. why did u decide to join the 104th trainees squad anyway?
When you hear Connie say that your heart stops.
You:when my home town shiganshina was invaded by Titans my mum was killed and I saw her be devoured by a Titan and then I knew that I had to get my revenge and kill them all every last one!
One you had finished talking you noticed Eren looking at you with his mouth open.
You:uhh.. sorry please excuse me.
You said as you run away crying. you don't know where anything is so you sit outside under a big tree peacefully until you hear footsteps and your name being called. you can't make out who it is until you can see him.
You: eren?....~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks for reading and there will be a part 2 if you want thanks again ~ Sophie âœ¨
