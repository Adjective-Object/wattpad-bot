Voodoo me,
Take my clothes,
Puncture my skin,
Let everybody know

I'll never be gone,

Tables spinning,
Tea mugs floored,
Years to clean
My poppy-inked soul,

Front house trees,
Creaked by the wind,
Shaded on me
Like gangs on virgin,

The roses free,
Gave pink (ones) to me,
They always rot too quickly,
'Cause you hurt me,

You want to hurt me,
'Cause you still care,
I had slipped away,
I'll slip again,

The water running,
I'm running after,
You won't find me,
I'm in the shower,

The sun goes red
To blue and cold,
I'll sleep to dream
Like I am old,

I'll paint the sky,
I'll live the lie,
Into the waves,
I'll be where I'm always,

I'll never be gone.
