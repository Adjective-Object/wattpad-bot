This story will be written in free time so I have no specific days to write, Yet I hope to write every week.
If you are a Doctor Who fan, I am too but don't hate on me if every detail on vortex's and paradox's are not correct, Thanks.
By the way I am having a glitch problem so sorry about the big gaps between every paragraph, I am working on getting rid of it.
I know many people would like people to keep the main characters in, Such as Amy and Rory. And they are going to still travel with the doctor yet He just ends up with a new companion aboard the Tardis. :D
You May carry on Now :)
Geronimo!
