They looked at her in shock. Sasuke turned to Naruto.
"I'm sorry... I didn't know."
"Same here." Naruto said, being oddly serious.
And that was the start of their friendship... only unfortunately Kakashi had to arrive at that time. Shadow growled and ordered shadows to wrap around Kakashi, in doing so accidentally letting out KI. All  three people still in the room looked at her in terror.
"I. Hate. WAITING!" Shadow yelled, as the shadows dug into Kakashi's skin. Blood began to trickle out.
"Umm... Calm down... Kotone-chan?" Naruto asked nervously.
"He deserves it." Shadow snarled, clenching her outstretched hand into a fist. Kakashi whimpered in pain as the shadows glowed red-hot.
"We had to wait too!" Sasuke said.
"Yeah, and at the moment I'm wondering how the hell you're not angry!"
"Calm down, Shadow!" Homura yelled from behind her. All eyes were on her as Shadow released her Shadow Jutsu and glared at her.
Homura sighed and looked at Shadow. "First of all, you need to loosen up. Coming to Konoha will do some good for you, I'm sure. And the villagers are happy... Kura invented Free Candy Day."
Shadow's face paled. "And where is she getting that candy?"
"She wouldn't tell me."
"That bitch... she's stealing from my candy stash."
"Well, that's it, I'm raiding your room... do you have Rolos?"
"Fuck yes- I mean no. Definitely not."
Homura grinned, revealing canine-like teeth. "Alright, I'll take your word for it..."
"Who the hell are you?" Naruto demanded.
"I'm Homura, bitch." Homura said lazily.
"Why did you call Kotone Shadow?" Sasuke asked monotone.
Homura looked at Sasuke. Then back to Shadow. Then back to Sasuke. Then back to Shadow. Then she burst out laughing.
"'Kotone'? You told them your name was Kotone?"
Shadow rolled her eyes. "Well, they wouldn't react very well to who I really am, ne?"
"Who are you?" Kakashi demanded, furious that he had been defeated so easily.
"The name's Shadow." Shadow said, rolling her eyes.
Kakashi gasped. "Sh-Shadow?"
"Who's Shadow?" Naruto asked cluelessly.
"Me, bitch." Shadow said.
"Don't you ever pay attention in class?" Sasuke asked at the same time. "Shadow's the Hesshoku, the leader of Ōkoku."
"What's Ooh-cookie?" Take a wild guess.
"Ōkoku." Homura corrected. "It's the name for the 8 most powerful villages in the Hidden Nations. Shadow brought them all together and formed the Alliance."
Naruto looked at Shadow with newfound fear and respect. "Wow..."
Shadow smirked. "Don't think it was easy, brat. I had to work hard to get to where I am, and if you want to be Hokage, you need to work hard as well."
Naruto nodded.
