Isaac:"Okay class, partner up". Normally you would go with your friend Lydia but today she was 'sick' probably getting her nails done. You knew that she could afford to miss a few classes, but you couldn't. Your grades were good but you had to work to keep it that way and you were proud of what you had achieved since moving to this school. You looked around the class seeing everyone partnered up, well everyone except one boy. " y/n you can go with Isaac today" the teacher said. You made your way over, tripping as you went to sit down next to him. You Pulled yourself up off the floor and slid into the seat."Hi, sorry I'm a bit clumsy. I'm y/n" you said"I know." He replied a small smile forming on his face, but then he saw where you were looking, you were looking at his black eye. His expression suddenly became serious as he faced the front. You didn't mean for it to seem like you were staring, it just caught your attention. You had never noticed it before." I'm clumsy too. Lacrosse" he said. You sat confused for a couple of seconds before realising that he was talking about his eye."Oh, it must have hurt, did the other player apologise? Was it jackson? I bet it was jackson." You ramble. He shifted in his seat."It wasn't jackson, it doesn't matter. Stop asking questions" he said defensively. You gave a small apology turning to the front. He opened his mouth to speak again, a look of guilt on his face, but he decided against it. Something didn't seem right but you didn't know what, so you carried on with your work in silence.
Brett: (imagine this is what his family is like)7:00 pm. You were suppose to be at their house by now, but you were stuck in traffic. Damn, you thought. You hoped they weren't going to take money off you for this. You were going to babysit at your mums friends house. She had told the family you would like to do it but really you just wanted to go home and watch TV. By 7:15 you arrived at the house rushing out of the car and making your way up to the house. Mr and Mrs Talbot met you at the door, thanked you and then left. This is going to be fun, you thought. "Hi I'm Lori, this is Tom, you must be y/n" a girl said as You knelt down to take off your boots. You looked at the two kids, Lori looked around 11, whilst Tom looked 6-7. You nodded, closing the door and following them into the living room. You saw a range of board games on the coffee table and after a long discussion you decided to play monopoly, as it would last the longest. You had been playing games for what seemed like hours and you had lost track of time; it was now 9:00 pm." okay Tom, time to go to bed" you said, standing up from your spot on the sofa. "But I don't want to, it want to play more games" he whined. You shook your head guiding him upstairs, wondering when his normal bedtime was. You decided to not feel guilty about it, it was Sunday tomorrow so he could always sleep in late.It took a lot of persuasion but you eventually got him to go to sleep. You walked downstairs into the living room landing in your spot next to Lori on the sofa. Tired after putting Tom to bed and playing games all night you decided to just sit and watch a film. You felt yourself slowing falling to sleep, waking yourself each time. However this didn't last long and you surrendered, letting sleep take over.BANG!.... You jumped awake, looking to the side of you and seeing that Lori was asleep. You decided to search the house and find the source of the noise. You made your way towards the kitchen, then you froze. You could hear mumbling and someone moving around in there. You grabbed the closest thing to you which happened to be a broom. Slowly, you crept into the kitchen, it was dark but you could still make out a tall figure. You were about to swing and hit them, but they turned around, jumping back surprised."Oh my god who are you!" He said." who am i? Who are you!" You replied. He sighed, realisation hitting him."You're the babysitter aren't you...". You nodded, lowering the broom. He chuckled slightly."What were you going to do, sweep me to death" he joked. You tried to hide your smile, returning the broom to its spot." you're lucky I didn't hit you, you wouldn't stand a chance against me" you replied. He laughed at this, shaking his head."You? You're what 3 foot tall?" He said. You were not happy at this, there was nothing wrong with your height, it wasn't your fault he was as tall as the Eiffel Tower. You didn't reply, you simply walked over to him, swinging your foot around to the back of his leg, bringing him down onto the floor and pinning him there."What we're you saying about my height?" You asked. He smirked." you're right, I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything, you can definitely defend yourself" he said. You suddenly became aware of your position. Blushing, you stood up, allowing him to stand up aswell. "I'm Brett" he said"Y/n" you replied, turning to go back into the living room.
