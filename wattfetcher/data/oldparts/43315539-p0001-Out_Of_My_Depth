I'm May and I'm 14 years old. I go to a small state school in St. Ives, Cornwall. My mum runs a florists and my dad sees me as a waste of space. My best friend Sasha moved to Africa 2 years a go and since then things haven't been great to say the least.
"Hey May." Shouted a boy in my year called Jake.
Him and his friends have been bullying me since Sasha left. I stood up to them once but tht was a big mistake. I ended up with cuts a bruises all over my face, arms and legs. When people asked about it I said that I had fallen down the rocks at the habour.
I have no one to stand up for me so I just ignore all the insults, punches and rocks that they throw at me when I walk past.
I'm the smart kid. I always do well in tests without having to revise and teachers love me which obly makes matters worse.
"Is it true you have already done the essay on Great Expectations for English?" Jay said closing in on me.
I didn't reply. There was no point. I just hung my head and looked at my feet.
"I thought so." He growled as he grabbed my bag and began to pull everything out if it. I watched helplessly as the other three boys joined in and began to rip my work in half and scatter it across the cobbles.
Once my bag was empty they turned on me. Jay took hold of my wrists and pulled them tight round my back as Liam and Carl went through my pockets. Then Brad came and slapped me hard accross the face. I was left surrounded by a miserable mess of what was my homework, face throbbing and bruising wrists.
This was a good day by my standards.
Okay so I hated school. Home wasn't exactly great either but at least I could hide away and lock the whole world out.
I would often dissapear for hours to a beautiful secret little cove where I would read, write songs and swim in the peaceful tranquility. It was my place of safety.
