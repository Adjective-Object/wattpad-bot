"Oh my goodness!" I said. "We were just attacked by a monster that doesn't exist!" I looked over at Sydney who had a serious look on her face. "You know what's going on, don't you?"
"We better get you home. I usually let the parents explain."
After that we quickly walked to my house which wasn't far away. I say house, but it is actually a basement apartment. My mom rented it because a)she doesn't like apartments that much and b)she doesn't want to be by herself in a house every day. The house was a medium sized house with the appearance of a cottage. The house was brown and white and the door was a dark brown. It is a beautiful house and I love staying in it for the summer. The yard is a beautiful green with flowers and trees in random places scattered everywhere.
"This it?" Sydney quickly asked.
"Wow, calm down. Yeah. The door is in the back."
Together we made our way to the back door. The back yard was as lively as the front. We walked down the few stairs that led to our white door and I knocked and tried the doorknob. I found it locked, which was strange. I got my key out of my bag and placed it in the keyhole. I couldn't wait to see the small tidy white walled rooms in which we rented. The whole apartment was one big room that made up two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a family room. I pulled out the key and opened the door.
What I saw inside made me jump. The rooms where covered in filth and garbage. On the walls were claw scratches that ran from one room to another. I ran over to my section of the room. Something was scratched on the wall that sent a cold shiver through my body. It read, "I'm waiting, demigod." Sydney read it over my shoulder. A look of absolute seriousness and fear appeared on her face.
"Sydney?"
"Pack a bag," she said. "We're going to Camp Half-Blood."
