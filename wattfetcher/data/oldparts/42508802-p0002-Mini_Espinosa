Kelsie's POV We all walked downstairs, and Matt made us some breakfast. After eating we sat in the living room and watched tv, until we all fell asleep again. -- I woke up again at 8:00, then I woke Molly up because we had to get ready for cheer again, I was feeling a little better, but I wasn't going to tumble or do stunts until we had to go over the routine. After we got dressed, I woke up Matt, and he took us to practice. -- After practice Matt still wasn't here, so I texted him, them Molly and I decided to do tumbling. So we went to the edge of the mat and tumbled across. After we were done we saw 9 guys, and 2 girls. 7 of the guys, and 2 of the girls with their eyes wide open. "Hello?" I said while waving my hand in front of their faces. "Anyone?" I asked. "That was amazing!" Everyone said. "Thanks. It wasn't that hard." We said.After talking about cheer, and stuff we all went back home, and got into the pool. Then we got out to get food, then went back in. We pretty much did it the whole day. Then we watched Pitch Perfect, then insidious, and during that movie I was snuggled into Matts chest the whole time, because I can't do scary movies. I'm so scared of them. Plus the boys thought it would be funny to scare me, by screaming at some parts, which made me scream. When it was over I was so relieved, but I decided to go to bed, because I was tired, Molly came up with me. Today was really fun, and crazy, I hope tomorrow, and at Magcon it will be like this too.
