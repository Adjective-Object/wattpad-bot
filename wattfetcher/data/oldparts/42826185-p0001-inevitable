"Hailey! hurry we're gonna get caught!" i heard my bestfriend say frantically from below me. i was trying to climb down the fence from our nearby waterpark. yes, we just broke into the waterpark. Michelle was an adrenaline junkie and i just loved adventures. i guess this is why we got along so well.
"holy crap" i yelled when i jumped down the fence and toppled on top of my bestfriend. it was almost one in the morning and we were trying so hard not to burst out laughing and wake up everyone in the neighborhood. we both finally got up and started sprinting home. everything was going fine until we turned a corner and BAM i bumped into someone and we both collapsed on the sidewalk. i was on top of him and i was so embarrassed.
"woah slow down forest gump. where are you heading so late? pretty girl like you this late at night isn't safe." right then he put his hands around my waist and had a tight grip.
"let go of me you sicko." i tried pushing him away but his grip just got tighter.
i was scared i didn't know what to do i mean this stuff only happened to people in the movies right? i tried to yell out to Mich but all he did was put his hand on my mouth while the other was still on my waist. i was whimpering by now kicking and trying to get his heavy weight off of me. right as he was trying to reach under my shirt a car passed by and then its headlights shined on us and it screeched to a stop. the guy said a few swear words and got his hands out from under my shirt while i was still there on the floor crying as he ran away.
"HEY! YEA YOU BETTER RUN YOU LOW LIFE!" then his voice softened when he saw me.
"oh my gosh are you okay? did he do anything to you? here come on ill give you a ride home." i was still crying but not as much and i wasn't sure what to do so i let him help me up, while still keeping my distance, and let him help me walk over to his car.
"I'm Jack and you're safe with me. I promise."
"Im hailey."
and thats where our story starts.
