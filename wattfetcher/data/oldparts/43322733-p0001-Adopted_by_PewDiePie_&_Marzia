I heard my mommy get slapped and yell in pain, and daddy hitting her and cackling. Blood creaked out from behind the door I was standing behind and stained the carpet. A thud was heard and I could only work what what happened before daddy came out of the room and grabbed by my collar and threw me in the car. He was covered in blood, so was I. I wailed strongly as I left my bunny at the house and cryed harshly. My daddy yelled at me, and slapped me, he drove off without his seat belt on or mine.
All I remembered was daddy screeching across the cliff and fell headfirst into the rocks below and died. I was later found by a fisherman who lived nearby. "Oh you poor little thing" he murmured.
