No.He won't smile without her.
No.He won't laugh without her.
No.He won't giggles without her.
For months,he stays that way.
But she comes into his life.When nobody notice him,she does.When nobody is beside him,she is.She is always near him.She is there everytime.
Excerpt :
"I noticed you only wear that bracelet on your right hand while the others are on your left hand."
"Is it something special?" I ask,looking at the bracelet and back to his face.He looks calm,ready to give me an answer. I am expecting a long story from him.
"Maybe."
"About a girl?".
"Guess so."
"Where is she?".
"So far away."
