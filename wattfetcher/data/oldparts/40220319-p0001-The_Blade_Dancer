The world was ruled by the Bolvark Empire, who followed one global law. Obey. Obey as in listen to the laws, always agree with the governments and live by their rules.However, if you had failed to comply with this law (Which wasn't really 'one' law), you were brought by the Higher Powers to the H-Zone, which was a court and prison combined. There, you would be sentenced to death without any trial. Throughout the days, those who were "disliked" by the Higher Powers went to the H-Zone and never returned.Only a few people knew about this, and those who tried to testify against the authority of the Gov' would be shot dead or assassinated the night before.
Now, a secret group of Rebels have started a underground Rebellion. This group of Rebels travel the world as Circus Actors that go by the name: The Blade Dancers; Assassinating members of The Higher Powers.
Finally, upon the votes of the entire Rebellion, The Blade Dancers crew have been asked to partake a dangerous suicide mission; To travel to the main city of the Bolvark Empire and kill the royal highness, himself.
