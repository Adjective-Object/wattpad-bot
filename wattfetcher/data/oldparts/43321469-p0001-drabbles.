you would imagine that a photo wouldn't determine an entire life, correct? that the single, minuscule act of a shutter closing would not set the course of someones future. and really, senior photos shouldn't matter–– but kotori had taken them very seriously. her summer had been spent exercising and skipping desserts and she had spent hours practicing her smile rather than practice the "necessary" skill of tea serving.

it had all led to this moment.
readjusting the coal-like fabric of the dress that hung on her frame once more ( really, it was like the umpteenth time she had done that ), the girl couldn't help the soft sigh that fell from lips painted the same color as her short locks. maybe she shouldn't have let her hairdresser do whatever they wanted to her hair– she loved the pink, but her father had been less than happy. what if her judgement of her hair had been clouded by mere teenage ignorance? kotori feared she would regret this when looking back on it. the line moved before her and she follows, heart beat rising as she neared the front.
it wasn't that she would value the photos ( that was a lie, she would treasure them ), it was that this single moment would be sent to almost everyone in relation to her. knowing her grandmother, it would be blown up and framed in the hall– which was the opposite of what she wanted.

two people away.
she took a moment to reapply her lipstick, dragging the color against her lips slowly, to take up time. she'd spent the last three, almost four, years with the people around her and though it was sad that it'd be over in less than a year, she was okay with it. was it wrong to think that she had outgrown those around her? maybe it was mean– yeah, it was definitely not nice.

one person.
rocking back and forth on her heels, the petite girl tried to calm her nerves. it was only a few minutes, right?
her turn.
