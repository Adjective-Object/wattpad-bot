sometimes iwonderhow it wouldbe, to be a clockto go on forever, tonever stop.
surely the hands' joy die out, theirlife drains away from thepain of having to keep going. even when there'sno one around.
how people depend on the clockfoolish really, that's what they are.but what if it wants to stopit must be exhaustedfrom going on f o r e v e rone day the clock will stop people will need to carry on one day the clock will stopbecause it's tired of trying to stay afloat when it's clearly       drowning.
