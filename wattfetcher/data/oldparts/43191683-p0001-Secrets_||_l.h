Emily Collins
"Emily run and don't stop running until you're safe" my mother whispered as she quietly opened the window so I could get away.
"Mom I don't want to leave you" I cried quietly.
"I'll be fine sweetie" she reassured me as the bedroom door swung open revealing my drunken step father. He stumbled towards us.
"Run sweetie" my mom said as I climbed up to the window...before I could reach the window, I heard my mom scream. I turned back to see my step father yank my mom to the floor.
"MOM!" I screamed and hurried down from the window to help her bit before I could reach her, she was dragged out of the room. The bedroom door shut. I grabbed my bag and climbed out the window and down the side of the house. I turned and took on last look at the house then turned back and ran.
I reached the bus station and got in the bus going to the airport. I had enough money to buy a ticket to Sydney where my aunt lived.
The bus arrived at the airport and I got off and bought my ticket and went and sat in the waiting area by the gate. Soon my flight was called and I boarded the plane and took my seat. -----------------------------------------The plane landed, I grabbed my things and got off the plane. I got in a taxi and give him my aunts address and sat back in the seat.
He pulled into the driveway and turned around and waited for me to pay him. I handed him the money and took a deep breath and stepped out of the car and walked to the front door. I hesitate before knocking, I finally grow some lady balls and knock on the door.
The door swung open revealing my aunt who had a very surprised look on her face.
"Emily what are you doing her" she asked, then grabbed my bag and lead me inside
"I need somewhere to stay until it's safe to go back home" I mumble
"What do you mean safe, is Pete hurting you again" she looked worried
"Yeah but it's not just me this time Aunt Kim" I whimper trying to hold back the tears.
"Oh sweetie you can stay here as long as you need to, you're always welcome here" she said sympathetically bringing me into a hug
She took me to the guest room and told me to get settled in while she made a few phone calls. she left and I fell back on the bed and closed my eyes and tried to relax I'm safe now.
