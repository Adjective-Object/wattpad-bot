After school, I was leaving track when I saw Ashton standing there. I was so surprised. I walked up to him and he smiled brightly at me.
"What are you doing here?" I asked surprised.
"Waiting for you," he responded bluntly.
"Why?" I felt confused.
"I know this is really sudden, but I've liked you since the first time I met you!" He grabbed my hands.
"Uhh," I said completely dumbfounded.
"Will you go out with me?" He asked, seriousness in his voice and eyes.
"Uh, sure," I agreed without thinking clearly.
My first boyfriend! My head screamed. I felt so excited!
