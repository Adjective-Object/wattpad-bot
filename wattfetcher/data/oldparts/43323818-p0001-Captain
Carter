That was the most amazing and craziest party ever!
Hi there you don't know me sorry I'm a little bit drunk hoo I think I saw a floating pink zebra anyhow my name is jade carter and don't tell anyone but I'm an alien captain of a spaceship shhh it's a secret!
I'm telling you because you are my best friend in the all galaxy, let me tell you how it all started.
Maybe a week ago I was like any 16 anti-social teenager I had stupid clothes, stupid friends, stupid life and a too happy mother.
My father died when I was a baby and I'm living with my mother in the stupid state Arizona.
It was a normal Monday I hated my life in my way to school, in class, in lunch time (a Specially because we have Mac and cheese and I'm allergic to stupid cheese) and on my way home from school in shortcut all the time.
I met my friend in this day in the afternoon and after i walked home.
when I arrived I saw my happy mother making a dinner she said "I made you some pancakes.
"I know what it's my favorite meal!" I answered with anger while I shove some pancakes in my mouth.
She said "why are you angry my beloved child in this beautiful day".
"Because it's my anti-social attitude!" I answered again with anger.
"why you have to ruin my life with your too happy behavior?" I asked while I took a beer and leaves the house.
While I was disappearing in the shadows of the night I heard her saying "I love you my sweet berry" it's made me hate her more!
