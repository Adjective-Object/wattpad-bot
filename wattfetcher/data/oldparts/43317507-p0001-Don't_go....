It's a chilly day here in California considering it's November. Im heading to school,walking. I started to make my way to school when i say a girl about my age. She was stepping out of the new house that just got built right around the corner. She has dark brown hair and she was swearing a black jacket and jeans with baby blue convers plus she had her backpack on her shoulder wich was a neon blue jan sport backpack.Then she turned her head and her eye's met mine.

I was fixing my sweater when i turned my head and found a pair of eyes that met mine. I stared and admired the boy's feartures. He had a hoody on that was dark red and a pair of dark blue jeans and black convers plus his backpack over his shoulder wich was a checkered pattern,His hair was brown. I just moved here 1 week ago and i had no friends so i decided to go talk to this boy. I walked over to him and he gave me a confused look "um....do i know you" he asked "probably not im lindy i just moved in the New built house i was wondering if you went to montana middle cuz i need help finding my way there"i replied.

This lindy chick asked me for directions for my middle school, so being the sweet heart i am i offered if she wanted to walk with me."wanna walk with me cuz i go there". Her face lit up and she nodded slowly. We started walking and i was leading the way. "So lindy when did you move in" i questioned "one week ago" she replied."well im Emit,nice to meet you" i shaked her hand."and im 12" i said "same here bud" she replied."cool". We talked about about our favorite mine was step brothers and her's was dumb and dumber.
We had finally arrived at school. "Thanks for walking with me,Emit" i grinned and nodded and with that she headed for the office so she could get her paper with all her classes on it. So i headed with randy and Simon, my closes friends.

I walked all the way to school with Emit he seemed really chill plus he was very cute. So i got all my classes listed my home room number is 28. I started heading to my home room when i ran into some chick she gave me a dirty look and said "watch were your going stupid, gosh". I just left and started walking to my home room again when i saw Emit he waved at me and i waved back then i started walking and i finally found my classroom. I opened the door slightly and walked in all the eyes landed on me i saw emit and that chick that i ran into in the hallways,they were still talking until the teacher started to speak. "Class this is our new student lindy please make her feel welcomed" she said."then i heard the same voice from the hallway say "oh great another doofuse". I looked down at my feet."Why don't you sit next to Emit, Emit please rais your hand" miss.Henderson said. Then i saw Emit's hand go into the air and i saw the empty seat next to him. I walked over to the desk and plopped down.Then the lesson begain again "hey" someone whispered im pretty sure it was Emit wich it was. "Hey" i said back. 5 minutes later we had to go to our next class,turns out Emit has all my classes. Me and Emit where becoming great friends.
-weeks later
-Emit's p.o.v.
I waited on the curve were i met lindy so we could walk together. Then i saw a familiar face with dark brown hair and green eyes it was lindy. She gave me a bright smile showing her white teeth. Me and lindy grown really close over these weeks it's been a month and a half. Then i saw her walking past me crying.I stood more quickly then i ever stood up and i ran towards her "lindy what happened" i asked worriedly "i can't believe You......i trusted you,YOU DICK"and with that she ran away in like 10 seconds she was outta my sight.I felt the tears swell my eyes then one tear left my eye. I did nothing i swear i didn't i would never hurt my best friend but in the coner of my eye i saw amany smirking and walking away with a big smirk on her face.
