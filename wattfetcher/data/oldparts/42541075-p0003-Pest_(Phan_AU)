We reached my house, so I waved goodbye to Cat.
"Call me if you change your mind about tonight, 'kay?" Cat called as she walked away.
I didn't respond. I just walked into my house and immediately threw myself down into the couch close to the front door. I practically melted into the comfortable cushions, which embraced me into a warm, welcoming hug.
"Dan?" My mother's soft voice called from somewhere else in the house.
"Yeah?" I answered.
"Just making sure you weren't a murderer," she laughed heartily. I loved her humor, the way she could turn any situation into a funny one. Her jokes were usually darker, which is probably where I get it from. I cherish her, probably way too much.
