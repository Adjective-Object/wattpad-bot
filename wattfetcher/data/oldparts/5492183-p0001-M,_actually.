Deep breaths, in and out. You'll get through this I recited to myself as I neared my car door, looking down at the pavement. My hand extended to greet the handle of my car door as I clutched it so tight my knuckles turned white. Usually I didn't mind first days of school, I even tended to enjoy them. But this school year had already started off to such a rocky beginning. Not only had my best friend in the whole world been expelled on the last day of school last year, but it was all my fault. I opened the car door to hear a familiar voice echoing from the end of my driveway.
"Hey Em, you seem kind of down." I looked to the origin of the sarcastic voice to find not only Mike Fitz. My heart suddenly started to beat at a million miles per minute, what should I do? I decided to ignore him and subtly slide into the driver's seat as if I had heard nothing. My plan was going smoothly until he decided to climb into the passenger's seat.
"What's wrong Ema, you're not happy to see me? You're not the only thing down today, im missing some action." He smirked as his hand leisurely slid to my lower thigh and squeezed before promptly removing it and positioning it on his lap.
"Mike, I don't have time for this.. I'm going to be late." I bit back as I rolled my eyes at how suddenly my morning had shifted.
"So what? I mean what's the worse that could happen.. you could get expelled?" He chuckled.
"Not funny Mike, what the fuck has gotten into you? Why are you being like this?"
"Into me? Nothing. But I have been getting into a few places this summer, If you know what I mean." Mike laughed, his joke appearing ammusing to himself. Once again I rolled my eyes.
"UGh, gross. Too much information!" I giggled, I literally could not resist his fuckboy humor. To which he responded in a chuckle right back. My first day of my last year in high school and I had expected to spend it all with this dipwad in the passanger seat of my Jeep and we had gone and fucked it all up. I started up my car, reminiscing about what had happened just a couple months before...
It was the last day of junior year and Mike and I had decided to pull one of our signiture pranks on the Principle, Mr. Shneiger. We rigged his whole office with a bunch bubble wrap (unoriginal I know, but still fricking hilarious), but right as we finished setting it all up Mr. Shnieger walked right in and saw the whole thing. Me, I was off the hook since it was my first time getting in trouble, but Mike was absolutely fucked since he has already been caught skipping class, smoking on school property and doing countless amounts of misdemeanors before. It was literally all my fault too since I was the one who had begged and pleaded for him to pull it off with me, he just wanted to end the year on a good note. Afterwards, that whole summer, he didn't speak to me once. I remember one night he snuck in my window like the millions of times before to tell me he was leaving, but since then ... never again until now. Finally we arrived at the entrance of the school, I stopped the car for a second and glanced over at Mike.
"So uh, what now? You kind of have to get out. I have five minutes to make it to homeroom"
"Enough to squeeze in a quicky?" He winked and laughed to himself. It was rediculous how much sexual humor he directed towards me, considering we had never as much as hooked up. I had zoned out for a bit and was brought back only when I realized he was about an inch from my face. "Tell me you're going to miss me, you know you are, you might as well just say it." He looked up at me smiling contently at himself, he knew exactly what he was doing to me. I looked away to avoid him spotting how hard core I was blushing, and managed a laugh and create sarcastic comeback.
