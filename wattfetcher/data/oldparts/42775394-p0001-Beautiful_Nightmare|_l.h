I hear wolf whistles and comments about me saying things like, "Let me see what that mouth can do." "Shake that ass." "Damn baby, come ride on this." or even "Babygirl are you from California cause you looking fine."
I flick them all off or shove them. I mean, come on. Those hoes can leave me alone. I hate this school already. I had to move here since my father sent me here. Something about a vampire trying to attack me, oh and may I add that I'm a werewolf.
I finally got to my locker. "Well, Hello."
"What?" I sassily said as I stuffed some books in my bag. I turned and looked at the tall blonde with a lip ring. "Sassy much?" He closes his locker. "Yeah, judge me." I roll my eyes, "Show me where the office is." I told him. He shrugged and showed me the way.
"You must be Klaudia Ryann?" The principal asked. I nodded my head, "Please call me Klau." (A/N: Pronounced claw.)
She nodded her head and hands me a schedule. I thank her and exit the office. I look down at my schedule and see that I have P.E first. Great.
I would have to change out of my outfit, no thanks. I was wearing black leggings, black tank top, red flannel, and black and white Adidas. I would just make an excuse and say that I haven't bought my P.E cloths yet.
"What's your name?" I asked the blonde guy. "Luke Hemmings." He smiles, "So, where is the gym?" I asked. "Just go straight ahead and then turn a left once you see the girls bathroom. You should see a gym and there would be a girls locker room on the right. Now I have to go to history. See yah!" Luke waves as I smile.~~I was late to my class but it don't matter. "Is this Mr.Brooks' class?" I asked as I scanned the class. They were all in their gym cloths and were playing basket ball. "Why yes it is. You're Klaudia?" I nod my head, "okay you will be on the red team. The jerseys are right over there. And why don't you have your gym clothes?" I look down at my shoes, "Sorry sir. I haven't purchased them yet. I will have them by tomorrow." I lied and took my flannel off and put it next to a post.
I put on the red jersey and joined in the game. I raise an eyebrow when I see a familiar person. "Ashton?"
He turns around, eyes widen, and runs up to me to hug me. "Klau! I missed you to much. We need to catch up. When do you have lunch?" I try to remember what time... "Around 11:55."
"We have lunch together." He wraps his arm around my shoulders, "Now let's win this game. Met me on the field later alright?" I nod and began to play.~*~*~*~*Lunch~*~*~*~*I got some food which was mash potatoes, green peas, and apple juice. What the fuck is this? I need some meat.
I leave the food on the table and just go to the field. There wasn't anyone here but a group of guys, maybe Ashton is with them. I walk up to them, "Have you guys seen a curly headed guy, hazel eyes. About the size of a small giraffe." I asked, "Right here." Ashton laughs.
"Oh, hey." I giggled, "Aren't you that one new hot girl?" A kid asked. "I don't know. Am I?" I rolled my eyes, "Luke?"
"Hey!" He spreads his arms for a hug, "Nah I'm good." I laugh and hug him. "You know him?" Ashton asked me, "Sadly yes, this loser has his locker next to mine." I playfully punched his arm.
"Hey guys." I hear a high pitched voice say, I turn around and see a short girl with ombr√© straight hair and brown eyes. "Oh, hi Katie." Let me guess, typical white girl. "Who is this?" She eyed me in disgust, "This is-" I cut Luke off.
"I'm Klau. Why is there a problem?" I look down at her. "Yeah, actually. I'm supposed to be the only girl here. Cause you know.. I'm hot." She twirls her fake hair, "Sorry bitch, but you're ugly ass fuck. Maybe go fuck off with some other dudes. These guys obviously don't want you." I laughed. "No, they love me. Look at my big ass. Don't get me started with these bouncy boobs." She places her hands on her boobs, pushing them up.
