Your P.O.V
I got up slowly and walked into the hallway slowly making my way toward the master bedroom. When i got there i reached for the door handle and turned it oh so slowly trying my best not to make a sound. I pushed the door open lightly and looked inside. I regretted this moment, i wish i never saw that. The room had blood stained on the carpet, dents and drips of blood on the walls. I look on the floor and saw a gun and there laid my mothers body. It looked so lifeless and beat up, i turned away quick i couldn't believe he killed her. i began to cry silently as i trembled. I looked inside the room again this time i was looking for my father when i spotted him on the bed. He was sobbing with his head held in his hands and next to him was the house phone. Suddenly he looked at me making me jump up. It felt like my soul had just left my body and i could feel my face grow really pale. "YN?" He said in a low tone, i backed up slowly and shook my head no. "YN!!" He said this time raising his voice and getting up his bed. He began to walk towards me, I slammed the door and ran back to Jazmyn's room.
You: Jazmyn we have to go. Now! *pulls her up*
Her: Where are we going? *sniffs*
You: *grabs bag from under the bed* Somewhere far away. *grabs her hand*
Her: Okay. What about mommy was she ok?
You: *tears* No...She was- He killed her.
Her: What? *cries* But she promised she would never leave us.
You: We have to go before da-
??: *bust door open* FREEZE!
You: *turns around* The police? How did y'all get here?
Police Officer: We got a phone call that a man had just killed his wife. Are you their children?
You: Yes. Where is my father?
PO: We didnt find him but it's not safe for y'all to be in this house. Lets go! We have to put y'all in a foster home.
You: Please don't split me and my sister up. We're all we got.
PO: Of Course not. Now come on.
I grabbed Jazmyn and we followed the police officer. Jazmyn was still crying but i told her that I'll always be there for her and that I'll never leave her side. As we walked out the house i could see a huge crowd of people staring at us. We got in the police car and i cradled Jazzy in my arms. She was only 5 and she had to witness her own mothers murder. I was just hoping that they found my father cause if they don't then he'll come looking for me and Jazmyn...God knows what he'll do to us..
