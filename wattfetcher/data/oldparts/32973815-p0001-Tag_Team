Chapter 1
I shot the basketball, my wrist flicking into a nerly perfect follow through.
swish.
Once again making another basket. I was standing in my driveway at 7:40am waiting for my lazy ass of a friend to come pick me up. It was September 2 and was the first day of senior year. Was I existed about going back to school? Not really. Was I existed about basketball season starting back up? Hell yeah!
I was pulled out of my thoughts as a loud car horn took me back to reality.
I spun around to see Jess (A.K.A my lazy ass friend) pulled up into my driveway. She steeped out of the car and gave me a once over.
"I see you put some real hard effort into looking nice for the first day of senior year." She said, sarcasm dripping from her tone.
I looked down at myself, I was wearing blue skinny jeans with a white blouse and light pink scarf. Along with brown boots that came up about two inches below my knee with a bight of my long socks sticking out the top and a black leather jacket.
This isn't dressing up?
Looking over at Jess I saw she was wearing a pink dress that stopped about 3 inches above her knee and a white long sleeve cardigan under neath her jacket, that was also leather.
"Oh I'm sorry that just because it was the first day of senior year I didn't want to freeze my ass off."
Jess rolled her eyes looking at me one more time before getting into the car,"Pain for beauty, Sabrina, pain for beauty."
I just rolled my eyes and hopped into the car as well.
——————————-
The ride to school was un-eventful, other then the fact that along the way Jess thought in would be a great idea to stop and pee four god dam times, turning our five minute ride into a 10 minute one.
Once we pulled into the school parking lot and grabbed our bags out of the car, Jess and I made our way toward the school. As we walked I coulden't help but feel a little creeped out as everyone just stared at us.
Jess and I have been known for playing basketball since our freshmen year of high school. In ninth grade we were playing at a league tournament and a collage scout that came for a univeristy game and saw Jess and I play. She spread the word about us around the university she worked for and after that more people came to see us play. Along the road some guy in the crowd starting sheering tag team as a reference to Jess and I. Since then we have been know all over our province for playing basketball and being know as the tag team.
After that our social cred at school went up a lot. Hence all the creepy ass stares.
We made our way into the school to see a frantic looking Emma coming our way. Emma is on our team, Jess and I are good friends with her but she is no way near as close to us as Jess and I are.
"SABRINA!JESS!"
Dear lord we just walked in the school what the fuck could be so important that she has to yell across the whole dam school.
"What Emma, what could be so important that it was worth bursting my eardrum over." Jess said clearly annoyed.
"It's about the girls basketball team!It's been cut!"
