So here's a little bit about myself..
My name is Marneshay but I liked to be called Shayy because, its easier to say.
I have this addiction with Instagram and Matthew Espinosa.He helped me a lot , I'll explain later in the book.
I live with my mom,brother, and my fish.
I know what you guys are wondering. Where is her dad?
Well my dad lives in Washington state he hopes to move to Cali to stay close to me and me sister.
That brings me to my siblings I have 3 sisters and 2 brothers all my dads kids.
When I was little I had this obsession with Youtubers such as Tyler Oakley and others. My mom always asked me what do I wanna be when I grow up I said a Youtuber. My mom being my mom didn't know what a Youtuber was,but she said okay and gave me an odd look.
Right now I'm 13 still wanting to be a Youtuber. I wanna show people that there is better things in life than judging people by there looks. Also, I wanna show people that you don't have to be perfect for a guy. Don't go out there wear the shortest shorts you can find or the highest crop top ever. I wanna be someone's idol one day and change a persons life.
