We're at a gas station and Mom goes in to pay. She comes back with a big smile on her face.
"Oh my gosh. You need to go in the store," she says.
"What?" I ask, confused.
She fishes through her purse and hands me some money. "Here's five dollars, buy a pack of gum or something. I don't care. You need to check out the cashier."
Looking at my sweatshirt and sweatpants, I reluctantly say, "okay."
I understood why she wanted me to go in, the cashier was extremely good looking.
The next day she says, "so I spoke to that cashier."
I look at her with wide eyes. "The hot one at the gas station?"
"Yea, I asked him how old he was," she says as though it is simply casual conversation.
"Mom, you can't do that!" I exclaim.
"Why not? I'm a mom, it's not weird." She shrugs. "He said he was 18 and that he went to the high school across town."
"Oh, you found out what high school he went to, too." I lift my arms and sigh. "You get his Social Security Number while you're at it?"
"No, but I asked if he was single."
