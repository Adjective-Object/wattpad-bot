Walking up to my front door, tightening my grip on the cardboard box that sat in between both my arms, I stared longingly at the house that stood in front of me. I never thought about moving houses, I thought I would stay in the same house in my sweet little town in London forever, but of course nothing ever goes to plan. For example me. My life was going great, you could even say I loved it. I had friends and family that loved me and which I loved back.. But of course I'm Scarlett Winters, and nothing ever goes well for me. On my 17th birthday my life turned upside down and now I was a 'troubled teenager' as my mother put it, I mean of course I was - I've moved to a totally different country, half way across the world, leaving everything behind to start a fresh.. It's a little late for that if you ask me.
One of the reasons we moved here was because I was 'spiralling out of control' - my grades dropped from straight A's to D's and I always found ways with my fake ID to get into nightclubs or I just wouldn't go home. If I went home I would have to sleep but every time I slept I had nightmares that were so realistic I couldn't awake from them and I would feel like I was stuck in the cycle of it, until one of my parents would come and wake me up, so for a while I took sleeping pills to help me sleep - without the nightmares. But one night I overdosed on them, accidentally. I didn't feel that they were working so I just decided that taking more would help. I started with two more and then the number slowly increased until I took all of them in the plastic bottle. My father found me on my bedroom floor; pale and lifeless, foam escaping my mouth as I laid there unconscious. I had to go to group therapy sessions after that for two weeks, it's not like I was addicted but it was either that or I would've got sent to a rehab clinic for a week. So I went for the option I thought would be easier.
The other reason we moved here was because my parents got transferred, they work in a highly regarded business which is why we got this house, we could afford it. They seem to use that as the main reason, but I knew that they got the transfer because they were going to move either way. My parents tried hard to help their little girl, it's a shame I wasn't their 'little girl' anymore, in fact far from it. All I know is I just need to make it through my last year at school then I can leave this hell whole once and for all..
"Scarlett, honey-" my mother called, "Can you bring me the rest of the boxes for the kitchen?" I obviously knew that was a rhetorical question and I had no choice but to do as she said, I couldn't handle more arguments, I had enough arguments with my parents to last a life time. Doing as she said I carried the brown boxes filled with cups; plates, bowls, pots and pans and all different utensils that were needed in the kitchen.
After placing the last box onto the counter I turned to my mother and gave her a small smile, "How do you like the house?" She asked me with a smile of her own. I looked around the kitchen and looked back at my mother "it's... Big" I replied hesitantly, I honestly didn't know how I felt about the house, my home was back in England, although this house was a lot bigger with three floors to it, it had a lounge, kitchen, dinning and games room and a study, three bedrooms - which were actually en suites and a huge garden, not forgetting the indoor swimming pool.. It was a big change and I didn't quite know how I felt. My mother gave me a sympathetic smile and carried on placing her cups into the cupboard, I just stood there quietly. "Why don't you go choose a room?" She asked and I simply nodded and walked away.

After choosing my room, which was obviously right at the top of the house away from my parents, I decided to start unpacking a few boxes, placing my neatly folded clothes into the drawers and hanging them up so they sat tidily in my walk-in closet. For the first time in months I actually felt... happy? Happy.. Yet empty. I had so many emotions I didn't know how to feel anymore. My house didn't feel like a home, my room didn't feel like mine..
