There were times when I'd blink and open my eyes to find myself somewhere else or discover claw marks on my forearms. I'd pass out, I assumed. I may be an amnesiac, another theory. No one could explain how I could move while in a coma-like state, or break my skin until it cried red.
My name isn't really Indi Flinch, but I can't use my real name. These are the documentations of how I discovered the dark cloud above my head and who summoned it.
