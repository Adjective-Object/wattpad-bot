"Hey I'm Samuel Hayden, but you can call me Sam."
His voice was electrifying. His dark blue eyes consumed me. I couldn't help myself but stare. His dirty blonde hair was fuzzy looking, and that nose... It was too cute.
He sent a shiver through my body. I knew he was different.
For hours we talked the first day. How he got his name, and how I got mine. Where we wanted to go in life and what our dreams were. Sam made me laugh and smile the whole time we talked. He sounded like a know-it-all, but I liked that. He knew what he wanted from life, and he knew he could win every argument. Sam amazed me, and I wondered for hours that night if he felt the same.
