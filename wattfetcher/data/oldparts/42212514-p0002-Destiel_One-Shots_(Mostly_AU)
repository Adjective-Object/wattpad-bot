Hi! This is the first one-shot I have ever written so please don't be to harsh. I got this idea from a Tumblr post and when I read it I loved it. So I thought why not write a Destiel version of it? I hope you enjoyed this little one-shot and if you have tips how I can improve my writing then please comment.
Bye XXX
