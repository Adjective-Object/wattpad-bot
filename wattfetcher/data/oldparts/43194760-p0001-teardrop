Chapter 1 : Cece
My name is Cece and I'm a typical fifteen year old except I suffer from depression I know what your thinking its a young age but let me tell you why I am depressed.
It all started two years ago I was happy with my little sister and my mum and dad we were a close family but then that night I heard mum and dad fighting and they got a divorced, that night our family broke apart dad left he now lives with his new wife Â (my step mum) but the thing is I hate my step mum, anyway now my mum is happy being single.
That's not all that made me depressed not that long ago I had a boyfriend I loved him for ages we were together for 3 years but then one night he was walking on the train tracks and he got hit by a train and now I haven't seen him for 4 months and I miss him.
So there the reasons why I'm so depressed I guess now I feel alone and broken I know I can't go back to the way things were the past is in the past I get it but still I just really want to be happy.
Anyway I'm a year 9 student at carravile high and my best friends Lucy and Rihanna know what I am going through and they support me everyday.
It was a typical Sunday and their I was at my dad's house I hated going there because of my step mum she is so rude she doesn't like my attitude, she doesn't like the way I talk, the way I dress and she just doesn't like me but she likes my little sister.
