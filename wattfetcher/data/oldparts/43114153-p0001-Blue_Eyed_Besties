"Hey, Alex!!!" I called by best-friend (also neighbor) from outside my window to hers.
She didn't answer. I got a pebble and threw it.
A few seconds later she poked her head out.
"What do you want?!" she said.
"Wanna ride to school with me?" I called.
She sighed."Sure." she rolled her eyes at me then went back inside.
I got dressed then got my skateboard. I ran down the stairs.
"Bye, mom." I kissed her cheek and ran out the door.
"Bye, sweetie!!!" I heard her call before I closed the door behind me.
I waited outside of Alex's house for a few minutes before she came outside with her penny board.
"Penny board?! Seriously?!" I asked her.
"Oh shut up, Grier. I can do whatever I want." she stuck her tounge out at me.
"Yeah. I guess you're right." I rolled my eyes at her and we rode the rest of the way to school in silence.
"Want to know something cool?" I asked Alex.
She glanced over to me suspiciously.
"Hmmm... Sure." she said turning back.
"I'm getting a pool." I said excited.
"Really?! Nice! When?!" she cried out.
"Next week." I sighed.
"Well. We can wait! Don't be sad!" she punched my arm softly.
"Yeah. You're right." I said.
"Of course, I am." she smiled.
"Do you want to know something cool?" she asked, looking over to me.
"What?" I asked looking at her too.
"I'm going to start a Vine account wanna join?" she asked. She looked pretty excited and I didn't want to let her down.
"Heck yeah!" I laughed.
"Cool. How do you wanna call it?" she asked.
"Hmmm. How about just Alex and Hayes?" I said.
"Oh ok." she smiled and we turned the corner to the school.
"Well see you after-school. My house?" I asked as we got of our boards
"Kay! See ya!" she said and went inside carrying her board.
I smiled and followed a few minutes later.
