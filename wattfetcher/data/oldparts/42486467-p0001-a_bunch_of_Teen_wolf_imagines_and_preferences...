Stiles:You pulled up in front of the school, hands wrapped around the straps on your bag in order to disguise the shaking. There was going to be a lot of attention on the first day, you knew that, but you didn't necessarily like it. The morning was long and boring, with you having to constantly ask people for directions around the endless corridors. However when lunch came, you couldn't be happier. You found a bench outside with a bag on it, thinking that someone had left it to go and play some sort of sport. "Uh....hi" you instantly looked up from your lunch, only to be blinded by the sun. You brought your hand up to shield your eyes, shocked at the sudden appearance of the boy in front of you."Hello..." you paused for a second, waiting for a name, wondering why he was talking to you."Oh, stiles. I mean, that's my name....my name is stiles." He said awkwardly, but you thought it was kind of sweet." I just came for my bag... Don't worry, I'll leave now" you nodded and watched as he struggled to put the straps over his shoulders with the lunch tray in his hands, laughing slightly when he finally managed to get it on. He started to walk away, turning his attention to you, giving you a little wave. He continued like this for a few steps....until he walked straight into another bench. A few curse words left his mouths as he turned a deep red, before walking away even faster.
scott:Running. It was your instinct. Your only thought as multiple arrows were flying through the a around you. You didn't think they would find you and your family hiding in the woods but they did. The hunters were always people you were afraid of and now they had killed your family. Your pack.You kept running, your lungs were burning even though you were a werewolf. You eventually came to a road. unable to tell where you are you took a left, hoping it lead to somewhere you could hide. They were getting closer and closer, you could hear their footsteps, their voices calling out into the silent night.you could smell their excitement. The thrill of the hunt that you had given into only a few days before. That's how they found you and your family.You couldn't run anymore so you entered an animal clinic, surprised that it was open at this hour.You hid behind a counter, closing your eyes and telling yourself to not worry. Suddenly you were grabbed and dragged into a dark room."It's ok, you're safe, I'm like you! I'm an alpha" you focused your eyes in the dark to see a pair of red ones staring back at you. You relaxed instantly."I'm scott" he said, moving back and letting you go."I'm y/n.... Do you think they know we're in here?" You asked." no they carried on, probably back to the woods, come with me you'll be safe" you hesitated for a minute unsure whether or not you could actually trust him, but seeing no other choice you nodded your head, following him out of the doors.
Liam: You were walking onto the lacrosse field with Scott and stiles when someone catches your eye. "Wow, who's in goal?" You ask to no one in particular."I don't know, but I don't like him" stiles said, eyeing him suspiciously."You can't say that you don't know him" you replied " he's pretty good, you never know, maybe he'll replace you stiles". Stiles looked at you and wrapped an arm around your shoulder."No one can replace me, I'm irreplaceable. Unique. Your one and only" He joked squeezing your shoulder with his hand as the three of you continued to walk towards the players." well you're definitely unique, I'll give you that" Scott said, wrapping his arm around your waist. You and the two boys had always been close, ever since you were little, and little acts like these barely phased you now. However to everyone else it was confusing, they didn't know who was dating who or if you were just friends."You know y/n, there are a lot more attractive people to date than stilinski. Why don't you give me your number and I can show you how to have a good time" Garrett called out, smirking at you. The boy from the goal now wondered up beside him. Great, you thought. he's hanging around with Garrett so he's bound to turn into a jerk."Why don't you just shut up Ken doll" you replied. Leaning closer towards stiles to prove a point. You knew stiles would go along with it, knowing it meant nothing as he was your (practically) older brother along with Scott. Garrett went to snap back at you but he was interrupted."Leave them alone Garrett, come on" the blue eyed boy said as he dragged his friend off to practice some more. You stared into his eyes, unable to look away as he blushed and then smirked, as he left."Stupid freshman..." Stiles muttered under his breath, before you kissed Scott and stiles on the cheek, wishing them luck. You stood at the side, cheering them on every now and then, but you couldn't stop watching the new kid. And he knew it.
