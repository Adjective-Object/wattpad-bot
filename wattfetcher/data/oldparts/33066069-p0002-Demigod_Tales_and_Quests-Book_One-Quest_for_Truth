She stormed out of the large room.
"Ahhh!!" The man yelled in frustration. "What have I done?"
"Zaylor! Zaylor! Get up! We're here! Zaylor!" I heard Sydney yell.
"Wow, calm down, I'm up!" I said as I stood up.
"You okay?" she asked me as we walked out of the bus.
"Yeah."
"Another nightmare?"
"Yeah, but it's cool."
Sydney didn't look like it was too cool.
"Are you okay?" I asked.
"Yeah. What was it about?"
"Nothing. Like I said, it's cool."
"Are you sure?"
"Yeah, I'm sure. Let it drop, please."
"Sorry. If you change your mind..."
"Yeah, okay."
We silently walked down the busy New York street towards my mom's house. Many yellow taxis passed us as we walked by as people loudly whistled and shouted, "Taxi!" We finally turned a corner to a dark alley filled with overflowing tin garbage cans and garbage scattered all over the ground.
"Come on," I said. "It's a shortcut to my house."
Sydney looked terrified. "Are you sure it's safe?"
I laughed. "I've walked through here many times. I'm sure it's safe."
The look on Sydney's face made me stop laughing. I suddenly became uneasy.
"Come on," I said trying to hide my fear. "We'll be fine. We'll just walk quickly."
"Okay," she gulped.
We both started walking down the dim alley.
"See, Syd," I said halfway through. "There is nothing-"
Sydney suddenly stopped dead in her tracks.
"Syd?"
"Flesh-eating horse."
"What?"
"Duck!"
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a large horse appeared out of the darkest part of the alley where the most garbage was. The horse was huge and paralyzing. I would have been horse food if Sydney hadn't knocked me over with her crutch.
"What the...?"
"Run!" she screamed.
We ran as fast as we could toward the end of the alley. The horse bit my backpack.
"Ah!"
"Ha!" Sydney sacked the monster with one of her crutches. The beast flew back with it, but we kept running. When we got to the end of the alley, Sydney had one crutch and I had one big hole in my backpack. The beast on the other hand wouldn't leave the darkness of the alley.
"What was that?" I panted.
"A flesh-eating horse," she panted back. "They live in horse poop."
"Ew!"
"Talk about it."
"Will you be okay without your crutch?" I asked.
Sydney stared at me funny. "We just met a mythological creature and you're asking about my crutch?"The reality of it all suddenly hit me in a hard impact.
