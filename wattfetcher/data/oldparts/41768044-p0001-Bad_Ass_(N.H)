The loud music coming from all directions isn't helping my headache. The haze in the smoke blurs my vision. As I weave my way through the crowd of dancing people, beads of sweat roll down my cheeks. My nude lipstick as well as my black eyeliner is smudged. My hair, which was once perfection, is now a heaping mess on my head.
Once I am able to get to the door, I realize that we didn't drive here. But since all the alcohol runs in my blood now I guess that's a good thing.
Hailing a cab drunk isn't exactly the easiest thing in the world. Once I get a cab I have trouble opening the door, finding out that it was locked didn't give me a good impression of the cabby.
"Where to miss?" The old fat guy driving asks.
"417 Brooklyn avenue." I try to sound snotty but instead sound stupid
(Disclaimer: I don't know if this is actually a place, don't hate if its not.)
"Okay then." Since Brooklyn is on the other side of town it takes almost half an hour. Once I get there I just get out if the cab and walk inside without even paying the bastard. Why should I? He took me to the wrong place, twice!
That bad realization when you remember you forgot the keys in the apartment. I reach into my pocket and find my phone. I call Sarah to see if she'll let me in with her set of keys. She has one for emergencies. I look up for once seeing someone walking out of their apartment.
"To many tequilas?" The blonde blue pair of eyes ask.
"Does it show?" I groggily ask.
"Little bit. I'm Niall, your neighbor I guess." He says while rubbing the back of his neck.
"Kaitlin." I say just above a whisper.
"Kaitlin, why are you sitting outside this apartment?"
"Niall, why are you just getting out of thaat apartment?" As I say this he starts laughing. "Why are you laughing at me?" This only causes him to laugh more. Sarah is running up the stairs and passes right past us.
"Sarah!" I yell and giggle as she turns around. She spins on her heels and gives me a funny look. Nialls walked away by now thinking what the hell just happened.
"Who was he?" She asks flirtatiously.
"You don't know Niall? Who doesn't know Niall?" I slightly slur, with a playful giggle. I can't tell. I that bad? Eh who cares.
"Me, I don't know Niall." She points to herself. I black out after she says this.
^THE NEXT DAY^
As soon as I wake up I walk,more like run, to the bathroom and hurl whatever was in my stomach. Once that was done I have a massive headache from the night before. I couldn't remember what happened after Sarah got to my apartment. I decide to go get more Tylenol and more food. I get dressed and head out the door.
As I lock the door I see a familiar face. Niall you idiot my subconscious mocks. I try to scurry along until he spots me.
"Hey der' Kaitlin." His strong Irish accent says.
"Hey Niall." I mumble. Then realize he's just getting into his apartment. "Are you a night-owl?"
"Why do you ask?" He asks with his brows furred.
"You where just leaving when I got home, now your just getting back." I explain my theory. He just chuckles.
"Kaitlin, it's 2 in the afternoon." He's full on laughing at this point. Then Brittany stumbles up the stairs.
