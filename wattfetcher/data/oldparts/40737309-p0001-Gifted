I hung my head down as I walked through the hallway. I new that I wouldn't be able to make friends being the freak that I am. I couldn't risk exposing myself to a normal human. I am human I thought. Well at least 88%. The rest is all sorts of powers that I've learned to control over the years. "How are you" a voice suddenly said, interrupting my thoughts. I look up to see a girl standing there. "I...I'm fine" I stuttered. "Do you know where to go?" said the girl. I took a minute to visual the map of the school I programmed in my head. The fourth classroom on the left. "Yes" I replied quietly. "Oh well maybe we could get to know each other more, but until you get situated I'll be hanging around and if you need anything my name is Nina" she said kindly. "Yeah" I said back "I would like that." So far I've seem to have made a new friend I thought as I walked into my classroom. Remember the plan I told myself. If you sense any danger you get the hell out of there. I took my seat and zoned out the entire boring class.
