Troians p.o.v:"this is really happening" I say To Keegan as he wrapped his arms round my waist."Yeah it is." he smiled kissing my lips softly.We both got in our silver SUV and soon enough were at the adoption centre.We knew that we were getting a thirteen year old girl and we were over the moon.
Charlottes p.o.v:"CHARLIE!" I heard one of the workers call.
"WHAT?!?" I yell back down.
"SOMEONES HERE TO ADOPT YOU."She replied.
What? Someone want to adopt me ? ...ME?
I rush down stairs with my clothes and iPhone 4.
"Hi!" A beautiful women in her late twenty smiled down at me and a man holding her hand is smiling to.
"Uh hi wait holy crap hi." I realised that it was Keegan Allen and Troian bellisario (there married but troian kept her last name.)
"How would you feel about us adopting you?" Keegan asks.
I looked around then realised no one else was in the room.
"Me?" I ask with a confused look
"Yes." they reply.
"Of course I don't mind!!" I reply
"Great!" Troian says.
We get into her huge car that TVs behind the the drivers seats...TVS!!!
