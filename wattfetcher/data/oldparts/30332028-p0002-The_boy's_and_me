"Hey" He said softly, and the small girl jumped back in suprise. "Whats your name?"
"Millie" She replied back, her voice small and fragile. Dan looked up at Phil, and he nodded.
"Well, Millie, how would you like to come home with us?"
"Really?" Her eyes lit up, and her small arms wrapped around Dan's tall frame.
"Really really." He laughed back, returning the gesture. "Sure, okay" She seemed giddy, yet still trudged up the stairs carefully and slowly, as if trying not to be seen. The boy's quickly filled out the papers, and an hour of files and horribly boring interviews later, the 3 were ready to go. They called another black taxi and arrived at starbucks.
"What would you like millie?" They asked her. During th hour, they found out Millie's background, and decided not to bring it up. Ever. They also found out that she is 12, and has an unhealthy obsession with bands, all of which Dan and Phil like, so thats good.
"Erm, I have never been here before, so I guess just a coffee?" She replied, still catious around her new parents.
"Okay, whatever you want." He turned to the cashier "Please can I have 1 regular coffee, and 2 Caramel Macchiatos to go"
Once the coffees were ready, the trio set off walking to thee apartment, content in the comfortable silence, and engrossed in their own thoughts.
