I feel like I exaggerate everything. I mean, I know I have had bad things happen in my life but what if I'm just over exaggerating? What if my life isn't THAT bad. Most people have it worse. Hell, some of my friends have it worse. I just don't see how my problems are so bad compared to theirs......but whatever......
