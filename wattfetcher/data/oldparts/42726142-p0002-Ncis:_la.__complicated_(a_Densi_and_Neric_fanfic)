Deeks povI woke up with a start. Tied to a chair, I looked around and yanked on the rope that tied my hands together as I saw the knifes and drills on a tray beside me. This was a torture chamber, and they planned on making me talk.I heard a scream as i lifted my head and watched in anguish as Sam lied time and time again through the agony to protect his wife.I jumped as they shocked him again and he spasmed in pain"Is Quinn an undercover agent?" Sidorov asked again, clearly not happy with the answer he was given."No!" Sam said, grinding his teeth in pain."I don't know why we bothered with you. When we have the weaker one!" He said walking towards me
Sam's eyes locked with mine as he silently plead with me to protect Michelle's identity. I gave a little nod and sam collapsed in his chair, clearly drained!"Well then, let's get started shall we?" Sidorov's man asked picking up a scalpel and slowly dragging it across my cheek.I let out a groan as they pried my mouth open with metal wire and reached for a drill.I screamed in agony as the drill dug into my teeth.
I closed my eyes and suddenly I wasn't in the dark, damp room, instead I was sat in Kensi's living room. A beer in one hand and the other lay across her shoulder as we sat there, watching some rubbish on TV.I was in our cover house, sat on the sofa talking about marriage and kids. About mutant ninja assassins.But most importantly, I was knelt on that hill with Kensi, arguing about communication, and I stood up, and I kissed her.The thought of her hating me for what I did hurt me worse than drill. I loved her, I really loved her and I knew I had to make it through this to tell her. If only for her to turn me down.
So the next time sidorov asked me whether Quinn was an agent, I didn't scream or yell in pain. I stared at him, i spat the blood out of my mouth and said one word"No."
