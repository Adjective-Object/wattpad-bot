"What do you mean, he's not at fault? He killed my clan!"
"It was a mission." Shadow explained. "Danzou ordered him to. So you see, the Uchiha clan were planning a coup. They wanted power, and they were tired of being accused of helping with the Kyuubi attack. So they decided to kill the Hokage and take over Konoha. You know that it didn't work, and that's only because of Itachi. He killed off the clan, but insisted that you not be harmed. Your brother loves you so much, Sasuke, and you just ignore that."
"You're lying." Sasuke said.
"It is impossible to lie in my dimension. Try it."
Sasuke tried to say 'I hate tomatoes', but it came out as "I love tomatoes."
"See?" Shadow asked.
"But- but it's your dimension, you probably made it so only you can lie!" Sasuke protested.
"Sasuke... You can ask the Hokage about it. He's trustworthy, no?" Shadow shook her head.
"But-"
"Don't you trust me? What do I have to gain by lying to you? Wouldn't it be so much easier to just let Itachi kill you? Then again, he wouldn't because he loves you so damn much!" Shadow yelled, standing up. Sasuke looked down.
"Sorry." He muttered.
"It's okay." Shadow said, smiling. "Do you believe me now?"
"Not completely. I'll ask the Hokage." Sasuke said.
"The let's go ask him! Not a second has passed in the outside world." Shadow said, releasing the dimension jutsu. They found themselves back just outside Konoha.
"Kakashi!" Shadow yelled. "Sasuke and I have to go ask the Hokage something. We'll catch up, okay?"
Kakashi's eye narrowed. "I'll come too."
"How about no, I said before I don't like you." Shadow said, walking away. Sasuke followed her.

"Old man Hokage!" Shadow burst through the door. "Sasuke has something he wants to ask you!"
"Was Itachi really ordered to kill the clan?" Sasuke asked.
The Hokage's panicked look was all the conformation Sasuke needed.
"So, Sasuke... do you believe me now?" Shadow asked, turning to Sasuke. He nodded, in shock.
"Who ordered him to do it?" Sasuke asked through clenched teeth.
The Hokage looked sad. "It was Danzou."
Sasuke looked murderous.
"Alright, Sasuke, I have an idea. Let's find Itachi and you and him can make up." Shadow suggested, not wanting to be responsible for any more deaths.
Sasuke took a deep breath and turned to her. "Sorry for not believing you." he said.
She smiled. "It's okay... now let's go catch up with Naru-kun and Kusoyaro-baka!"
Sasuke raised an eyebrow. "Kusoyaro?" He asked. Shadow nodded.
"I hate that guy!"
