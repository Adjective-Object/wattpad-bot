We lay ther dor a while, and i balck out.
When i wake up, i turn to see Login gone.
Well duh, he wasn't going to stay.
I get up, and take a bath, and head to school.
I arrive just as the late bell rings, and notice login standing by the gate.
The memories from last night come rushing in, and i turn a bright red.
"Ember." He calls.
I try not to notice, and walk by him.
He takes my hand by my elbow, and turns me around, to face him.
"We're not friends anymore." He says harshly.
"I know." I whisper, and the tears start pricking my eyes.
"Because i want you to be my girlfriend." He says, and kisses me.
I close my eyes, and my hands go to his hair instantly.
Yes!
