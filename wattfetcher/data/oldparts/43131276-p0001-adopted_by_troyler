M O L L I EWhen I was six, my dad turned into a murderer, setting our house on fire, immediately killing my mum and leaving me with bad injuries. I was an only child, with no older family to go to, after my family being taking away from me when I was at such a young age, as the hospital said. I ended up being taken into an adoption home. â€¢I've been at Ocean View adoption home for nine years now, and it's bad. I'm not saying this for pity, or to make people adopt me. I'm being honest. Being the oldest person, i'm left to look after the younger kids, who have been chucked in here because their parents are abusive or just plain lazy. One young girl called Alexia recently got adopted by a nice couple. I wonder how it feels to be rejected- time and time again. Oh, wait, I already know. ........Oh my gosh, Star, seriously, another fanfic? Yes, i know, but i wanted to write another one, as lying for love is very nearly other!Shoutout to : phansperf & carry.on.my.wayward.hobbits on instagram for proofreading :))
