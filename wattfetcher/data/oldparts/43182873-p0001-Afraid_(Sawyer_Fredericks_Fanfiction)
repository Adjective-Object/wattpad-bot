Ally's POV
I woke up to the screeching of car tires. Great, it's probably just my drunk dad again getting back from his favorite bar. Quickly I get up and close the door, locking it. Listening quietly I heard my mother do the same. You never want to get in the way when my dad is drunk. It's like he loses every form of self control he has when he has had far beyond the legal drinking limit. Unfortunately his drinking problem has gotten a lot worst over the years. At first he would only go out once a week to get a drink with his buddies. Soon though it became two days a week and quickly escalated to almost every day of the week. Hearing my father turn on the TV I sigh this is going to be a rough night. Turning the sound up as loud as he can he begins to watch hockey his favorite sport, and let me say he gets quite into these games. A few minutes later I hear the sound of his rage echoing throughout the house. Suddenly I hear glass shattering and realize that he is probably flipping out and chucking furniture and throwing things all around. He does this almost every day so this isn't a surprise to me anymore. I learned pretty quickly to put all my valuable possessions in my room to hide them from him. Everything that's within his reach is in danger of being chucked against the wall or stomped on. Since he goes to the bar everyday he spends most of our money. And when he runs out of money and has to get some more to pay for his precious alcohol he scavenges throughout the house looking for things that he can get a pretty penny for. One time I lost my guitar signed by Ray Lamontagne because he took it to a pawn shop and sold it. I hate my father with every bone in my body. That's why my mom and I are planning to escape. When he is out at the bar we are going to pack our belongings and never look back, we are going to find our safe haven. I went to sleep with this comforting thought in my head. Only a few more days....
