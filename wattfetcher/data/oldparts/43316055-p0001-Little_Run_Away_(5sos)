A/N: the prologue contains innapropriate language and violent scenes(best way I can put it) if you do not like that stuff please wait till the words are no longer bolded or in italics. Doing this because I don't want to bother you guys. Sorry of this is annoying.************************************
Becca:
I couldn't do it anymore. Tonight was the last straw. My mom had finally come home when my dad had started. I thought she would help, but she just stood there and smiled! She let him hurt me, abuse me, rape me.*flashback*"Becca, darling daddy needs you."
I shiver at my dad's haunting voice. Dad? Should he even be called that? No, not after all he does to me.
The door rattles and I slide further under my covers, trying in a pathetic way to block out the world.
"Becky, please open the door. I promise not to hurt you."
I cringe at the nickname he used tfor me. Along time ago I would have smiled, but things have changed so much.
The door rattles louder and James' voice becomes loud and angry. "Becca Jones open this door before I break it down! I need you love and you wouldn't want to make daddy angry would you?!" James hisses through the door.
Monster. I think to myself. Just leave me alone.
The door rattles louder and there he is standing in my doorway, looking angry.
