(A/N: Hi! So, yeah. I included my name here as the main protagonist. Sorry if it's a bit crappy 'cause I'm not good at writing romance. I just dreamt of the theme of this story. I want to get the idea out of my brain. Enjoy! ♥♥♥)..................................................................
The principal walks to a black-haired girl with red highlights and says:
"Welcome to the University of Memphis, Miss Rica!"-scene cuts-
Rica is seen looking at the names of the students and teachers. A guy accidentally bumped on her.
"Oof!"
"Oops. Sorry, Miss." said the guy while helping her up.
Rica blushed. His hands were soft and warm.
"See you around." he winked and then left.
-scene fades to white-
It was the first day of class. Rica looked around and saw the same guy before.
"Oh my gosh! You're my...."
-scene cuts-
A blonde-haired girl bumped on Rica. She frowned at her and slapped her.
"JOHN'S MINE, YOU UGLY FAT LITTLE MAGGOT!" she yelled.
John came to the commotion and tried to pry the girl away from Rica.-scene cuts-
Rica is seen cutting while holding John's picture to her chest. (A/N: C'mon, Rica! You're better than this! Crying over a guy?!)
John rushes inside the bathroom to find Rica surrounded by her own pool of blood.
"Oh my...! Rica!!!"
A few hours later and Rica is resting on John's lap. Without a warning, she lifts up her head and kisses John.
-scene cuts with drum beat-
Rica returns to John's house and saw the girl from before kissing John. She stumbled back and gasped. John got away from the girl and ran towards Rica. Rica shakes her head in disbelief and left.
"Rica, wait! Come back!"
"Oh, c'mon, John! You know she's younger than you!" the girl pointed out.
-scene turns to black-A man is heard talking in the background.
"No! I want Ko-"
BANG!
"Jen! No!!!"..........................................................................
