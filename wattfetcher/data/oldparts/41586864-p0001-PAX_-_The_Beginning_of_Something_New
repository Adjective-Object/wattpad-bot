As the Pack got ready to travel to Boston, for PAX East, they also knew that the majority of their fans would be doing the same. One girl in particular, who was travelling all the way from the UK to meet the entire Pack, was organising school work to be sent to her teachers by email, so that she could still be on time with the homework tasks and go to America for 2 weeks.
The girl in particular's name was Caitlin, but her friends called her Cat for short. She was 17 years old and a huge gaming geek, watching anything from Minecraft to Slenderman. And often playing the games as well, just so she knew what the gamers that she watched felt when they played the games.
