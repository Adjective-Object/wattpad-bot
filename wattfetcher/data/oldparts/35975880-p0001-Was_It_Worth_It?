Setosorcerer was just taking a walk, a little outside of the normal area of the Sky Kingdom, a little bit into no one's territory. Well, I suppose as I say no one's, that isn't completely true, as there was villagers and players who had chosen not to live in any kingdoms.
(Seto's P.O.V)
I looked around at the plains, that eventually dissolved into a swamp. Hidden behind a tree, I saw a little hut. So naturally, I decided to see who was inside.
As I walked up to it and knocked on the door, I suddenly realized it was a witch's hut. Although it was a bad idea, I couldn't run now or it'd be angry and attack me.
"Hello? What do you want?" The witch snapped.
"Um, j-just wanting to... Buy something," I said, noticing a for sale sign inside the hut.
"Oh, are you interested in these glasses? They enable you to see the future. What've you got, boy?"
"I'll trade you some leather for them," I replied. If I didn't buy the glasses, I was afraid I'd be attacked.
"Perfect," The witch said, snatching the leather and placing the glasses in my hands.
I put the glasses on and walked away, laughing a little bit. They didn't help see at all, they only distorted vision a little bit. But I didn't need the leather anyway.
However, once I glanced back at the Sky Kingdom, I saw something differently entirely.
