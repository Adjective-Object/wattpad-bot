" Mom dad you ruined my life" I shrieked. "Honey,calm down" my mom said. "Calm down? You just told me we're moving and you want me to calm down? I hate you!" I screamed while running out the kitchen. I ran into my bedroom. I looked at what I was about to lose. My best friends, Abby and Lucy, all my work , my happiness everything. Why did my mom have to get a promotion?. Why make me move to New York? Why! "Sapphire, can I come in?" my mom whispered." Fine" I mumbled. "I know it's hard leaving your school and friends but it will be a nice change you can get away from that girl you don't like" I thought about it I did hate that girl. "Plus we'll be getting a bigger house so you can have a bigger room and a garden" my mom said. " ok " I said. " you better start packing your clothes and stuff" mom said. "Ok" I said. " mom I'm sorry " I whispered. " it's ok honey" mom said and she leaves.
" Sapphire, the moving vans here." Dad shouted. " here's all my things dad" I said. Mom only gave me 4 boxes so I got most of my stuff packed. I snatched my iPhone and jumped in the car. I played my playlist. Style played and I didn't feel so bad. Maybe my mom was right. Maybe a change was ok. I hope.
