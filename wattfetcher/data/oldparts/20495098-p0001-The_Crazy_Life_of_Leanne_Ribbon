We were walking to class, he was walking next to me. I couldn't stop looking over my shoulder; maybe he was looking at me too.
After school I heard him call: "Leanne, I need to tell you something." I turned around, there he was. We both took a step back from ourselves, I was turning red; I could feel it.
"Should I say something" I thought to myself. Soon he broke the silience, he studdered, "C-can I ask you something?" I nodded.
"I--" "LEANNE HURRY UP!!!" Oh no... It was my best friend, Nel, yelling and waving at me. I had to go, after all Nel was my ride home.
I wish I didn't leave. Now I have to wait until tomorrow, which means new classes. Our school has been under construction and now we have to move in to the temporary classrooms. New rooms.
