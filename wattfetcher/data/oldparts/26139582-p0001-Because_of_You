It's been a year since I became a guardian but I still remember Elsa she is pretty hard to forget and I'm not going to forget anytime soon. The other guardians don't know this well, actually no one knows this but Jamie wasn't my first believer.My very first believer was Elsa but that was 200 years ago and we fell in love with each other. I really miss her even before I became a guardian I pleaded with Manny to bring her back I will love her endlessly. Sometimes when I'm not with the others I'd sulk in this clearing that of which was in a cave that no one knew about anyway I made it my own personal winter wonderland.Today though I could not sulk at my absolute favorite place since Elsa died, today Manny is choosing a new guardian I could only hope it's her but at the same time not let my emotions get the better of me because honestly I can't let Bunny torment me for the next 100 years. I feel that he unlike the others don't have the ability to be sympathetic even if he does then he has a funny way of showing it. But that's besides the point I have to make sure that my inner turmoil stays intact for everyone's sake because I could not risk my friends life because of my inner avalanche of loneliness. I can only hope either that's it's Elsa or my feelings don't get the best of me............but no one else can melt my frozen heart the way she can and I am pretty sure no one else will.
