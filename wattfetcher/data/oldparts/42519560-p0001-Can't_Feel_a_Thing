I ran. Oh god I ran. I had to get as far away as I could. It was building speed. I heard cracks from sticks it stomped on and how heavily it was breathing. I then tripped as I heard it chuckle. Damn it. I'm doomed. I closed my eyes, waiting for pain. Instead I felt it covering my face.
Oh god its smothering me!! I pushed it off but then noticed I was in my room. Oh...it was just a bad dream. I saw Shane smiling as he put the pillow back on the bed.  "Morning Laura the Lame." He smirked.  "Morning Shane the Shit Head!" I threw the pillow at him.
My best friend just has to be a shit head. Shane & I have a love hate relationship but hey we make it work...somehow. I got up and yawned as I opened my closet, grabbing jeans and a t-shirt. I went to the bathroom and got dressed, combed my hair, and brushed my teeth.
I came out as Shane was playing on my old Game Cube, of course without my permission. Like usual. I sat next to him and watched him play. We took turns playing Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. It started to get dark as Shane yawned.   "Hmmm, hey Laura?" He looked at me.  "Yea?" I paused the game and.looked at him. He had a smirk on his face.  "Let's play chicken in the woods." He stood up. I turned off the Game Cube and smiled.  "You're on!" I bolted outside to my backyard. I then stood in front of the trail leading into the dense forest, waiting for Shane to catch up.
