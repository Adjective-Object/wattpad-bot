Camille's POV
Hi. My name is Camille Alicia Howard but, people call me Cami. I am 5'11, I have caramel skin, and I have long naturally curly hair. Enough about me though. My family is extremely wealthy. I'm talking we carry enough money around each time we go to the mall to buy the whole store. I have 7 siblings. First is Andre (Dre) then me, then Chantelle (Channi), then Chantler (Chan), then Katen (Kay), then Malik (He choose the nickname, Lil Man) then Jasmine (Jazzy), then Marlin (Mar). Our dad is Dwight Howard (45 years old) and our mom Jennifer Lopez (40 years old).I know what you're thinking, yes we have a really big family. There are 10 of us living in a 45,000 square foot mansion.
My dad used to play for the Lakers until he retired. He still looks like he did when he used to play basketball. Recently my dad got an opportunity to coach the Thunders, but they train in Atlanta so we had to move there. I'm excited but I am a little nervous because I have to go to a new school and a new dance school. I also have to make new friends. My mom says that I am being ridiculous and that I will make lots of friends and fit right in. My mom and dad along with my 7 siblings are my best friends. At least Dre, Channi, Chan, Kay, and I are going to the same school. We are going to Chamley High School. We are moving in 3 days buts I don't know if I want to move. All my friends are here in California but, I guess I have to wait to see what the future holds. I know I will have friends, but then again am I really sure?
Dre's POV
Wassup? My name is Dre. I'm pretty sure that my sister ,Camille, told you about our family so I'll just skip that. To get straight to the point, we are moving and I have mixed feelings about it. For my entire life I have lived in California but, now my family and I are moving to ATL (Atlanta). I am kind of excited though. I have talked to all my brothers and sister and they feel the same way I do. Anyways we move in 3 days and right now we are packing the rest of our stuff. Man I'm nervous!
