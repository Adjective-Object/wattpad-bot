Hey guys, I'm going to be writing this book and i did write it in my English class and it's going to end in a cliffhanger, hope u enjoy!! And let me know if u like it.
Walking in the long dark, muddy forest. Feeling that there's something at the very end I need to find.
Something's waiting to be found, something what's lost for days, weeks, months, years even century's. Something what was there before I was born deep down the past, where the forest was once an Victorian city.
I have no fear, just curious to find what my soul is telling me, A special gift? A skeleton?, it could be anything
Still walking only 10-15 minutes until I find what I'm supposed to find, Maybe it's one of my family members who died a long, long time ago.
Maybe her or his ghost is still here, who wants to go into the light and be free by me needing to hurry up and fins the thing my soul is telling me to find.
Not sure what it is but my soul is telling me I'll see it when I get there. Nervous but not scared, I am strong to not give up.
I slowed my pace down knowing I'm here, slowly looking up from the ground and looking around was a city, not any ordinary city, this city was old. WAIT, it's an Victorian city.
Seeing people walking past me.. Dressed in old fashioned clothes what makes the people Victorians but they would be dead by now. I looked down and saw I was wearing old fashioned clothes to, confusion ran up my body and I started to turn back round to the forest... But the forest wasn't there.. I'M TRAPPED...
I hope u enjoy reading this book, I think I might create a number 2 what will be called I'm trapped in the Victorian city#2 so if u want me to write the next book let me know and I should be able to write it as soon as possible. Thanks for reading..
