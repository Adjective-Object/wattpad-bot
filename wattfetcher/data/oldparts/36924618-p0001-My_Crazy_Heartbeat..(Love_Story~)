Sigh...I woked up and get my glasses, I stand and looked at the mirror "Another day huh..." I said glarring at the mirror. I go to the shower and washed"Sis!! Breakfast is ready!!" My loud sister said
"I'll be there.." I shouted back as I wrapped a towel in my body and get some clothesI wore a black t- shirt, some jeans and a black and white converse"SIS!!!" she shouted "COMINGGG!!" I run downstairs and said good morning to my Mom and SisMy mom smiled while my sis sticked her tounge out"So what's the food?" I smiled "oh, Nuggets dear" mom said, I just ate a little "Sis...can I see that?" I asked my sister, she just shake her head..while I growl "ugh..I'm going" I glare at my sister and get my bag..."oh? Ok dear" i kissed mom in the cheeks "bye!" I waved while running
Sigh, I saw Louise walking in my direction "hey duds~!" I told her "hey doodie~" she told me, I just laughed..while walking with her"So what's up?" She asked "nothing much...boring life I guess"..she nodded .."well..were here..." I sighed and opened the door
I saw everyone....sigh.... "Hi Oni-Chan.." I went to Fred.."hey imotou~" he waved, I nodded "Hey Mel..look..there's Zen~" Louise winked at me and Fred chuckled
Ok... Fine..I'll admit it Zen is my crush but JUST A LITTLE
