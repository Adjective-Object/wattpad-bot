My name is Lily Fall. I have a mother, a father who is out of town, a 16-year old sister named Isabella and a 14-year old brother named Dominic. I am 13 years old. I have long blond hair and blue-green eyes. I have freckles and I wear a ponytail a lot.
Well, anyways, Isabella and Dominic were fighting so I decided to go outside for a walk.
"Mom?" I called. She turned her head and smiled at me.
"Hi sweetie," she nodded. I noticed she was washing the dishes. "Do you need anything?" She brushed her brown hair over her shoulder.    "Is it all right if I go for a walk in the woods?" I asked. "I'm twelve, I'm old enough to go alone, plus those two are fighting and once they do you cant stop them."    Mom stopped washing a frying pan and ran her fingers through her hair. "Are you sure you'll be safe?"    "I'm sure."    "Will you keep your phone with you so you can call me?"
"Mm hm."    "Then..." Mom sighed. "Go ahead, Lil. Only for thirty minutes."
I smiled. "Thanks Mom."
I turned the doorknob and skipped outside, closing the door behind me. I began to walk down the rough gravel road and I took a sharp turn left, into Sky High Woods. Yeah, that's what it's called. The trees aren't even that tall, anyways.
As I walked through down the path, I took in a deep breath. Fresh air was nice.
Ding!
My phone let out a dingy sound. I pulled it out of my pocket and read the text my mom just sent to me.
Hey Lily! Is everything okay? 😅 I hope so. Just, call me back, all right? Turn around once you get to the intersection, okay? Remember, only 30 minutes! 😋😝😜
I quickly typed out a reply and sent it back to her.
I'm doing fine! 😉 I promise I'll turn back at the intersection. And, I remember only 30 minutes! 😛
I grinned and rolled my eyes. My mom of course texts me the minute I get into the woods. What, it's not like a bear will come out of nowhere.    I froze as I saw a squirrel run across the path. It had gray fur. Aww! Squirrels were so cute.
It scuttled into a bush and I kept walking. I suddenly squinted when I saw something... Shimmer? Nah.
There it was again.
The shimmer.
I frowned and took a careful step forward.
Veeeery careful.
It couldn't be a bug. Bugs don't SHIMMER! Unless it's a bug I don't know of. Ugh, never mind. Wait, should I text mom? How about until I know what it is. Plus, I don't mom to panic.
I stepped forward and crouched down in front of the object. It was small, and green. Greenish blue. I think it was...
A gem.

Ehhhh the first chapter was kind of bad. But I promise, the next part will be a lot better! It's just, I wasn't really sure what to do when she walked through the forest. :3
