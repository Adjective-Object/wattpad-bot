"why do you guys hate me, i've done nothing to you" i said
"you should know better then to talk back" when i heard that i heard that voice my heart started pounding out side my ribcage not in good way, it was like someone pointing a gun at my head. i started praying for life, he walked up to me, then ...smelt my hair, sending chil down my spin.
