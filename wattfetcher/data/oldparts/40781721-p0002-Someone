"What did you do?" I said crossing my arms again. He wiped away fake tears, and looked hurt.
"Can't I wake up without having to have done something?"
"No." I said yawing and uncrossing my arms. He still looked hurt. He wraped me me in a hug. I aware he was trying to squeeze me to death. I pushed up on his chest. For a moment I was right above him. His eyes staring into mine. I kept telling myself to kiss him right then and there. But I pushed away before I could. He ran back to his room, he waved at me to follow.  And I did. When I got to his room. He was putting on a new shirt. He bounced down on his bed and pated the side next to his telling me to lay beside him. I pounced on the side next to his. It made him role over. He groaned as he roles over he faced me on his side. I shivered at the closeness of him. My crush was right next to me. I sighed and rolled over till I was looking at the ceiling.
"Hey. Do I smell funny or something?" He said and smelled his shirt. I laughed and faced him again. I leaned over to him.
