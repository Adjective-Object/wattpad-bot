I sit next to my grandmother who is in her rocking chair next to the fireplace. She seems calm and sleepy. Her eyes are fluttering open and then closed, unable to either fall asleep or stay awake. I lie on the couch beside her with my head leaned against the armrest and my body covered in a blanket she knitted for me when I was just a child. She looks so peaceful; I wish I was like her. Instead I'm me . . . fucking me. I'm the one who worries about her grades. And I can't take a fucking test without feeling my anxiety creeping up on me. I wish I didn't suffer with anxiety.
"Why don't you get ready for school my dear, we both know you don't want to be late," she speaks softly. Her voice is soothing; it could probably have me fall asleep within minutes. I sit up on the couch.
"Grandmother, would you like your medication before I leave?" I say showing her the smile she always loves. I take care of my grandmother and live with her because she can't afford to live in a retirement home and plus my grandfather passed away. I'm all she has, and she's all I have. My parents threw me out of the house when they found out that I've been failing important tests, it was because of my anxiety, but they didn't care. I was their only child and they kicked me out. Thankfully my grandmother let me stay with her, and I've been taking care of her because she's the only one I care about in this world now.
I put the different kinds of pills she has to take into a small container and hand it to her. She lifts her small hands up and holds the container in her hands. "Thank you, lovely. You're too kind," she smiles.
I grab my backpack off of the couch and toss it over my shoulder. I carry my bag outside with me to the bus stop. I wait for the bus to arrive to drop me off at a place called hell.
