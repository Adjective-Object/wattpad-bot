Why hello all of the lovely people who are currently reading this right now! It's Victoria! To be honest, I'm not writing and posting this for a while. When the time comes, the time will come and you will see the adventures of Emma and of new characters that come along in the story. Anyways I actually just write this one for fun when I want to. Not sure when I want to post this. Maybe when I can't think of anything for Memories Lost or when it ends. But I'm excited to work on this! So I hope you like it and feedback is always welcome! Bye! -Victoria
