Fallan's p.o.v.
I was just a normal teenager. I was, at least, until I was attacked. It wasn't a street brawl, but a full blown track-and-attack. Just last week, I was walking around the halls with other kids that looked normal. My best friend Gen and I were walking to fifth period science. We were talking about how annoying some of the boys in our class were, When a girl jumped out from behind a corner. She snuck up on us, which is something you just don't do.I noticed something sticking out of her mouth and it was gleaming slightly. Then, I noticed that it was part of her. Gen asked me if I saw it too and I nodded my head. Even though we were both really freaked out, we somehow managed to focus as we learned about the cell cycle five minutes later.
After school, as we walked to my house, we discussed what had happened. "What do you think it was," I asked as calmly as I could.
"I honestly don't know, Fallan. Whatever it was, I just hope we never see it again.Just as my friend spoke, I was aware of another presence near us, even though I couldn't see it. I looked around, but did not see our secret spectator. "Let's go. I have a bad feeling. I want to get home as soon as possible." Gen nodded in response and we raced off.
As we walked into my parents' mansion, I quickly called our other best friend Jae. I waited for him to pick up and as soon as he did I said, "have you seen anything weird lately?"
"Weird as in what? Girls with glowing eyes and fangs?" He laughed hysterically. I remained silent and he said, "wait, are you serious? You really saw a girl with eyes that glowed like the moon and had fangs?" He started to panic at my silent confirmation. However, he calmed himself immediately.
"Umm, yeah. Gen saw her, too. Do you have any idea what is going on?"
"No. I wish I did though."
I told him to just stop standing around on the phone and look it up. He said he would call when he found something. If anyone can figure this out, Jae can. When my phone call was finished, I found Gen sitting on a tall, white barstool eating a brownie.
"So what did Jae have to say?"
"Good news or bad news?" She told me to give her the bad news so she didn't get happy to nothing. "Well, Jae saw her, too and has no idea what to do. On the bright side, he is looking it up as we speak."
"I guess it's better than nothing. But for now, let's start on our project."After we finished the project, a diagram of a cell and the cell cycle, we sat on the baby blue couch in my room. We watched an hour of a Harry Potter marathon. Then, my phone rang. Gen answered so fast I had barely moved a centimeter and said, "hold on I'm gonna put you on speaker."
Jae began talking, "we aren't the only ones hat see them. There only two other people in this area. One is 56 and named Alliah Silver and the other is our age."
"So someone our age can see these people, too. I see that as a good thing, but who is it" I say. I am told that I'm not going to like it._____________________________________________________________________First chapter!!! I'm really excited about this. I hope to update at least once a week of not more. Sometimes I get a little busy with school though, so it may not be every week. It is prewritten so that will make it easier. I will update as much as possible. So tell me what you guys think!
