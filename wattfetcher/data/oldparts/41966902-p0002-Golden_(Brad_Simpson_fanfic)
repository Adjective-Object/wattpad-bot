"We'll always be best of friends Brad."
"Always and forever. Are you okay now?"
"Yeah." I swam slightly away from Brad and turned back round to face him again, smirking.
"What are you smirking ab-" I cut him by splashing him with water. He wiped his face off using his hands.
"Oh." Brad opened his eyes. "That's it!" I put my hands out in front of me too stop Brad from splashing me. "You are so going to pa-"
"Lauren your moms here honey." Brads mom came out onto the porch.
"Bye Brad." I smiled at Brad and swam over to the steps of the swimming pool.
"Are you coming round tomorrow, Lauren?" Brad asked me.
"I don't know it depends what my mom says." I climbed out of the swimming pool and grabbed my towel wrapping it around me. I walked over to Brads mom.
"Bye Lauren." Brad shouted over to you.
"Bye Brad." I walked into the house to see my mom standing near the table.
"Hi honey." My mom said to me.
"Hey mom." I smiled and walked up to give my mom a hug.
"Your father and I have got to go somewhere for a couple of days so your going to stay here-"
"Really?" I turned to Brads mom.
"Really." She replied.
"But-" My mom said. "You must be on your very best behaviour like I know you can be okay?"
"Okay." I replied.
"Don't worry Sarah, she'll be okay she always is." Brads mom said to my mom.
"Where's daddy?" I asked.
"His still at work his going to meet me in town."
"I love you mom, tell dad love him as well."
"I will, sweetheart. Come and give me a hug then." I walked over to my mom and gave her a hug. "I've packed your suitcase for you, all of things are in there. Including your homework." You pulled a disgusted face. "Which you've got to do." My mom carried on.
"I'll make sure she does it Brad's got some as well. Don't worry Sarah, now get moving." Brads mom smiled.
"You be good now Lauren I'll see you when I get back."
"Bye mom." I said I watched as she walked out of the door.
"Can I go back outside please?" I asked Brads mom.
"Sure. Be careful though."
I walked back out onto the porch quietly and look out towards the pool, Brad was sitting on top the slide. I walked quietly down the steps and over the slide. I stepped up each step, quietly.
"Hey Brad." You said excitedly.
"Lauren?" He turned around but slipped and ended up going down the slide.
"Brad!? Oh my. Are you okay?" I sat at the top of the slide and slid down. "Brad." I made it to the bottom and swam over to Brad engulfing him into a hug. "Are you okay." I said squeezing him.
