Back in Manhattan, in a fancy condo with fancy furniture was a girl with too much money. She had everything she wanted even when she didn't need it. But the girl's happiness didn't last long until she woke up on her phone ringing many times , when she pulled her head out of the pillow and answered the phone ,there was a women saying "Hello, Ms.King this is St. George hospital, and we have bad news for you." when she heard that she jumped up and said "what's wrong?""Just don't panic ma'am, please." Said the nurse from the hospital. "I am sorry to inform you that your father has just passed away. He was shot to death." When she heard the news she just froze because she couldn't believe what she had heard. the last thing she expected in life was her father's death because that would change everything in her life. And this girl is ME.
