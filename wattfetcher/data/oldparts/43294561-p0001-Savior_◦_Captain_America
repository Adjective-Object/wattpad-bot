❝The city is prettier when you're roaming it with someone else. ❞
Thalia Evans has made a lot of mistakes during her life, and one of those was graduating with the best marks when she attended S.H.E.I.L.D Academy, because if she didn't then she wouldn't have to put up with Nick Fury and his avengers. She is a highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D., with an incompetent partner. Thalia lies for a living, she has no morals and she does whatever she pleases, except when Fury orders her to do something. She has to deal with problems that most women at the ripe age of twenty-four, don't have to put up with like - HYDRA and Captain America following her around.
In some ways, Thalia is like a cockroach - she adapts and she survives. She's an assassin, delinquent, and a vigilant all in one and Thalia is probably going to be the one to save everyone else. Steve Rodgers would go as far as saying that Thalia Evans would be their savior.  God save the queen is the only saying that could properly describe what Thalia is going through.
