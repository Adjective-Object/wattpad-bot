We started it together
Said we'd end it together
You promised
Does your word mean anything?
Is it fake?
Like you?
Do you remember what you told me you wanted?
You wanted someone to be there for you.
You wanted a friend
Just one
We both did
We gave that to each other
But you gave up
You let go
Forgot me
Only when you miss your past
I'm your childhood games
You back to for comfort
Then your ready for the world again
You play me like your controller
Why?
Does "Gaia" mean anything?
Do I mean anything anymore?
