Nobody's P.O.V
So with they started to talk at first Naruto was upset that he was chosen to be the one to keep the Kyuubi inside of him but he got over it and he also found out who his parents were and was really surprised that the person with Blond hair was really the fourth also his father. That when he understood why he was chosen to be the Kyuubi's container. To say Minato was pissed was an understatement he was way passed pissed when he found out how the villagers treated his son. When they were done talking Minato said to Naruto that Kyuubi will be his older brother, and he will be taking care of Naruto, also so that he could watch over him and to Naruto's surprise his whiskers will also disappear when he is release....... Well not really Kyubbi is still trapped inside of Naruto Just that he could go outside whenever he wanted. At first Naruto didn't trust Kyuubi but they started to talk and now they are friends or in other words brothers.
