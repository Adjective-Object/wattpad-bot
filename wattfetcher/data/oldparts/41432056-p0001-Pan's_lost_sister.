Krystal POV

"Sorry I can't come over." I say whileÂ  closes the bathroom door.
"Come on. It will be fun." begs my best friend Kellie. She doesn't understand that I hate all kinds of parties.
"Girl u know I hate all kinds of parties."
"I know, but-"
"No buts. I'm not going. Also, there's a horror movie marathon on tonight and I'm not missing that."
"Alright. See u tomorrow."
"Ok. Bye." I hang up before she can say bye because I need a shower.

I put on a gray sweater that says take me to Paris and some white and black plaid shirts with pink tied strings. Also, some cute little bunny slippers. I also put my hair into a sloppy bun. (all of that is in the picture above). I run downstairs and flop on the couch. My TV was already on and put on the channel so........yea. I had this day planned out. I have chips, popcorn, soda, chocolate, gummy bears, ice cream and root beer floats!
*2 hours later*
What the heck was that? Was that a shadow? Then all of a sudden a thing just flies in my window. Oh poo. That thing then blows this purple powder in my face and I fall asleep. The last thing I remember is flying somewhere. Somewhere that I don't know and I don't wanna be.
A/N: Where is Krystal going? Also, this is my first FanFiction . So go easy on me. Tell me what you like and if I should change anything. Bye!
