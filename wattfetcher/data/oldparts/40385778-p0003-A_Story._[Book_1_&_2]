Both of us looked to our right, to see one girl and a boy running after a cart of supplies.I stood up, and luckily stopped the cart. The girl and boy smiled, and thanked me.
"Umm.. What's all this?", I asked.
"Oh, this? These are the supplies for the Winter Concert!"
"Uhhh... What now? And why so early?"
"One, we don't know.", the boy started, pointing to him, then the girl. "And two, Winter is coming pretty early, and the seniors from last year has left for college."
I looked to the girl. "What grade are you guys in?"
"This is our first year here. Dunno why I got enrolled to this kind of school. I mean, there is so many gifted students around here.. And to answer your question, 10th grade.", the boy answered for her.
"True. I love playing the piano!", I said, smiling widely.
"I guess I'm good at making children smile..?", the boy replied, making a confused tone at the end of that sentence. "Oh! Forgot! I'm Mario, and this is..."
The girl looked to him. He looked to her, but she shook her head. I kept glancing at both of them."Never mind, she's too shy to say. She's-"
The girl took him by the hand, and dragged him away from me. That was... Awkward?Is she.. Mute?
Raynie stood up, smiling. "I gotta go. My brother might be roaming far off without me..."I looked to her, and smiled back. "Okay! Bye, Raynie! See you soon!"
She waved back, and started walking off.There is a Winter Concert coming up? When? How? What is going to be there? Where?!
Questions are so common in my life, I can't keep track.I decided to go to the Auditorium, maybe there's someone there that can answer my questions.

I arrived, and went in, seeing groups of children and some staff members walking around.I quickly spotted Mario and that girl. I ran to them, and waved. But wait. How did they get the cart in here? Didn't I see the cart in front of me a few moments ago? While I was outside?
Well, I know that cart is a magical one.All I need is a broom closet, and I'm all set.
Mario spotted me too, and waved."Oh, hey!"
"Hi, Mario!"
Suddenly, a brown hair boy popped up. He quickly inspected me, which freaked me out."Who are you? Why are you here..?"
"I'm... Kathy..?"
"Oh, hello Kathy. I'm Freddy. Assistant of the person who's setting this place up."
"Who's the leader?-"
"WAIT A SECOND! THAT ISN'T WHERE IT'S SUPPOSE TO GO!"
I glanced at a girl yelling at two men carrying some giant potted plants.
"But miss, Christine told us to-"
"CHRISTINE IS THE ONE WHO TAKES CARE OF THE STAGE! I TOLD YOU TWICE, AND I HATE TO RAISE MY VOICE, BUT... YOU HAVE TO FREAKING PLACE THOSE PLANTS ON THE CORNER OF THE STAGE!"
Her voice was so loud, I think my ears popped out from my head... ((Autocorrect changed 'popped' to pooped...))Wait.. Isn't that.. Olivia?!
