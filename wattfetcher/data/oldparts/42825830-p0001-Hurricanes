Hey there! I'm Alison, and as you may know, I really like to write stories. Since mid May, I've been working on a story and I'm ready to begin sharing it with you. It is not even close to complete, so hang tight as I struggle to get through this summer and write at the same time. I have the first two and a half chapters written, and I'm going to try to write as often as possible. Of course, the more feedback I get the more inspired I'll be to write so (; um yeah I'm planning on posting the first part tonight so keep your eyes open, and I'll talk to you soon!
