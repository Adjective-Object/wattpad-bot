This isn't some fluffy oogly lovey dovey type of story. This isn't going to be about true love and relationships. This is about a boy, struggling through his life to find himself. Darian faces many challenges, and what you see on surface, is but a shadow of who he used to be. Inside, Darien is broken, shattered, depressed. But with every challenge he faces, he finds out a bit more about himself. But with every challenge he faces, he becomes stronger, and grows. But one day, will it all be too much? Will he use what he has gained, or will he just end it all?
