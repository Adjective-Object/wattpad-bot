Chapter 1.Tyler's POV (MunchingBrotato)
I was playing on Minecraft with Chrisandthemike and CyaNideEPiC, also known as Chris and Jorge. But I liked to call Jorge, CyaNide.
We were playing on the Hypixel server. We were playing 'Build Battle'. It was for a recording. "Hello! Today I am with-" Chris started but I cut him off. "Me! The lovely MunchingBrotato. I look good in thongs" I smiled.
"-And CyaNide" Chris said as he laughed. "Yep, yep!" CyaNide said as he sprinted around the lobby. "What are we playing today, Mr. MunchingBrotato?" Chris asked. "We are in the Hypixel server, playing build battle!" I say.
"Yay! I'm gonna win, I build better than these losers!" Chris laughed. "I'll have you know! I built the Eiffel Tower!" I say. "I built the Statue of Liberty!" CyaNide laughed. There was a pause, me and CyaNide waited for Chris to think of a comeback.
"I built you!" Chris said after a few seconds. We all bursted out laughing. "Okay, mother" I saying jokingly. "I am not your mother!" Chris said. "Yeah, you said you built him" CyaNide laughed. "Oh yeah, right" Chris said.
"Okay! Let's just go play!" I say as I entered a game. Chris and CyaNide entered the same game as me. We waited in the lobby for the game to start. We talked, and talked, and talked. Until we spawned in our own place thing and began to start building.
"We have to build a... A computer!" Chris said. I started to pick out some blocks and build a computer. "Ugh! My computer looks like a toilet!" I complained making CyaNide and Chris laugh. "I thought you were the master builder! You said you built the Eiffel Tower!" Chris laughed.
I groaned. I forgot I said that. "No, I lied" I said. Chris did a fake gasp.
~~~~Timeskip~~~~We were done recording. None of us won Build Battle. "Okay guys. I have to go, Carlo's making dinner" Chris said. Who's Carlo? "Okay, bye Chris!" CyaNide said. "Um, who's Carlo?" I asked. "Oh right! We haven't introduced you guys to each other, yet!" Chris said.
"Well introduce you guys, later. I have to go, too. I have to make dinner" CyaNide said. I nodded "Alright, bye guys!" I say. I quickly log off Minecraft and turn off my computer. I stand up and go to my kitchen.
I made myself dinner. Suddenly, I got a call. It was from Adam, also known as Skydoesminecraft. I picked up the call. "Hey Adam" I say.
"Hey, want to record something today?" He asked me. "Oh, sorry. I can't. I have to do something later" I say in a sad tone. "Oh okay. Well, I'll see you later, okay?" Adam said. I nodded "Okay" I say as I hang up. I sighed as I began to eat my dinner.
After I ate my dinner, I put the plate away in the sink. I walk to the living room and sat on my couch. I watched a little bit of TV until I heard my phone go off. Someone texted me.
I looked at my phone, and saw that Chris has texted me. He told me to call him. I called him. He answered. "Okay so. Are you done eating? Because I was talking to CyaNide and we agreed that you and Carlo should meet" Chris said.
"Does Carlo know who I am?" I asked him. "Nope. I didn't tell him about you, yet" Chris admitted. I sighed "Yeah sure. In real life or in Minecraft?" I asked. "Let's do Minecraft first. I'll add him in our Skype call chat" Chris said, and in the background I could hear typing and clicking of a computer mouse.
I nodded as I went on my computer and went back on Minecraft and Skype. "Okay, I'll call you" Chris said as he hung up. Then, my Skype went off and I accepted the call. I saw Chris' face pop up. "Let me add CyaNide" Chris said as he added CyaNide in the call.
CyaNide's face popped up. "Hey guys" he said. "Hey, hold on let me go and tell Carlo to go on Skype" Chris said as he got up from his computer and walked into a room.
