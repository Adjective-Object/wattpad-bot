Everyone who likes Five Night's at Freddy's always wanted to know what Foxy would look like as a human, so of course I drew it.
I love fnaf and Foxy is just one of the animatronics that was "possessed" by a dead child because of the Purple Man.
Enjoy and thanks! This book has quite a few reads and a bit votes, but I'll take it! Please request any thing you want me to draw! Thank you!
(I'll try to draw Mangle as a human as well!)
Sorry if it was a little light too see, and it reads "Hey, don't be afraid."
