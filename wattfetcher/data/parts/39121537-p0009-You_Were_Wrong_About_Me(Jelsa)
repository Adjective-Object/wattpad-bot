"If I accept your offer, and move to New York what will my living arrangements be?"

"Well you will make 45% of your sales, and you will start out living in my mansion.

When my eyes widened, in shock.

He must have seen this because he quickly said, "Not like that, if anything you remind me more of my sister."

"You have a sister?"

"Had a sister. She was in a car accident and died, you look and act just like her. She wanted to be famous one day, was full of hopes and dreams, but would do anything for her family."

"So it won't be creepy?" I said raising an eyebrow.

"No, to prove it." He stuck out his hand and said, "Elsa Queen, would you do me the honor of being my almost sister."

I chuckled, shook his hand, and said, "Anything for my almost brother."

"So if you don't mind me asking, why did you suddenly change your mind?"

I told him the story of what happened to my family when we were little, all I gave up for Anna, and what happened tonight.

He took out a pen and paper, and wrote down some stuff. When he was done, he ripped it off, and handed it to me. It said:

.Weak/useless
.Ugly/imperfect/hideous
.Dumb/moronic
.Quiet
.Talentless
.Unwanted/Unloved

"Hans, what is this?"

"It's a list, a list of everything they said you were."

"Oh, I know that, I mean why is it on a list?"

"Because sis, I am going to help you prove them wrong for every single thing they said about you."

"Do you have one, a list I mean?"

"Yeah, and I think together we can prove the world wrong."

I smiled and hugged my new big brother.

"Hans, can I stay here? I don't want to go back to my house."

"Sure sis! It gets lonely in this huge flat anyway."

He let me sleep in the spare bedroom, and told me to get some rest. He started shutting the door, when I stopped him.
