"I'll see you guys later." Alan said looking at the guys before me and walking off to take his precious photos.
"So how was your alone time with Alan?" Aaron asked.
"It was interesting."
"How so?" He asked, "Did something happen?"
"Almost." I said looking at me, "We almost kissed but he backed up before it could happen. I was so close."
"Aw what happened?" He asked laughing.
"He doesn't want to do anything, he's here for business and school that's it. I mean the kids all professional."
"That's what we told you." He said rolling his eyes.
"Still doesn't mean anything. I'm just giving him his time before I try again."
"And when are you trying again?"
"Whenever I get the chance. I'll start with simple things like just putting an arm around his shoulder. Getting him alone, ya know. Stuff like that."
"Maybe you should just leave him alone. Or wait for him to make a move first."
"I'll start and let him finish."
"Or you could let him do it." He said rolling his eyes.
"Someone has to make the first move. Why not me?"
"Because you should wait until he's actually ready for that kind of thing- if he's ever ready. You can't just force yourself onto him."
"I'm not forcing myself onto him. I'm just putting out the extra step to try something. If he makes a move then that's fine by me."
Aaron rolled his eyes, "Whatever."
"Come on, if you were gay, you'd think he was adorable."
"No, ginger's not my type." He said shaking his head.
"He's the only ginger I've ever found attractive."
"Too bad he's so not into you huh?"
"He's into me, he just needs time."
"You keep telling yourself that buddy." He said patting my back.
I rolled my eyes, "I will keep telling myself that because its the truth."
"Sure it is."
"Whatever."
"Well, I'm going to go get something to drink before Pierce finishes their set." He said and walked off.  I sighed and kept watching as there set progress and go on. They were really good, they always were.
Eventually their set ended though and they all walked off. Their stage crew took their stuff down and ours set up our stuff.
The guys and I gathered together and talked about everything before going on to play one hell of a show.


Vic's POV



After the guys and I finished up our set I went to the back to grab a water when I saw Kellin and held back a groan. Don't get me wrong the kid is adorable but he never stops talking.
