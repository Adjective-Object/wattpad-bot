Rory's POV I am freaking out, Hayes was at the door! The one guy who broke my heart. And I was going to open the door. Now before you respond to what's about to happen. Just know, I had no control over my movement or my actions. So just brace yourself. I opened the door. I slapped him. "Oww," he stated. "Why'd you leave me!" I quickly yelled. "I came back!" He quickened. "Why?" I questioned. "Because it was wrong of me to leave you, because, because I LOVE YOU!" He yelled. I took action and kissed him. "I love you too." I whispered in his ear. He picked me up. Carrying me through the hall, shutting the door with his foot. He set me on the couch, and grabbed me a nature valley bar. "Wow, you really do love me." I giggled. "Truly." He commented. "And I, love. You." I smiled. We started to watch our favorite show. After that, Hayes went to cook dinner. It was an amazing Italian pasta. It was honestly delicious, and so romantic. "You know I'm eighteen." I taunted. "So, you think your ready?" Hayes sweetened up. "I know I am." I raised my eyebrows. We headed upstairs, up into my room.
Hi, I'm the author. I am going to end the chapter here. I honestly don't write about stuff like that. It makes me uncomfortable. So sorry if you were looking forward to that for some reason.
