"I gotta go before mom freaks out." I said, just then Riley calls me, "H-Hello?" I hiccup, "Competition is cancelled, and why are you crying." she asked, "I don't want to talk about it." I said, "Please?" She begged, "He cheated on me, don't do anything to him either." I said.
"Fine, but you'll be fine." she said, I cry harder then scream as a huge semi truck speeds my way. "Oh my gosh what's wrong?" Riley screams through the phone, "The car just flipped over please get Cameron." I cried harder.
Jake was still alive he crawled next to me, I call Cameron, "Cameron help me." I cry, "Where are you?" He asked, "On the bridge." I cried, "I'm coming." he said, I see Cameron, he opens the door and tells me to hold on to the roof I do and he gets my legs out.
"I want to go home." I cried harder, "You are I promise." he said, I got out the car and Cameron picked me up along with Jake, "I was supposed to die." I said he puts me in the car. "No you weren't babes." he said I got a cut on my side.
I took out the glass grunting in pain, he takes me in the kitchen, everyone was there I don't look at anyone except Cameron, "I can't I was supposed to die Cameron." I said starting to cry, he hugs me and I tuck myself in his shoulder.
He brings me upstairs, he looks at my side, "It's not that bad." he said, Jake laid beside me, "Shhh." he said as I started to sob, I hear Sammy saying it's all his fault, I get up and walk downstairs, "It's not your fault, don't blame yourself, it's mine for not paying attention." I said, he hugs me, "I'm so sorry." he cries, "Shh, It's okay." I mumble.
He nods, I walk back up to Cameron he cleans my cuts and puts a bandage on my cuts, I slowly fall asleep next to Jake and Cameron.
