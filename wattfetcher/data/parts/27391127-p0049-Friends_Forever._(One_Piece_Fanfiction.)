Hello minna. First time that @grace9550 and @kerianna88 hung out at Rodney Bay together and it was fun! Back to the chapter at hand. It will end next chappy, the arc that is.

Above is a video tribute to Marco. (no he didn't die) For those who are not familiar watch, for those who already know, watch.

Minna, yes that it a Den Den Mushi. Just so that those who don't remember now remember.

"Hey Marco, what are you doing here?!" Haruka asked trying to feign ignorance but doing a terrible job at it.

"Cut the crap, where are the others?"
"At the Castle, I assume." Haruka answered nervously rubbing the back of his head.

"I'll call Aya on the Den Den Mushi." Haruka answered shamefully pulling out his Den Den Mushi.

At the Castle...

Aya, Sakura and Millie were in the castle's ballroom.

Purpurupurupuru.

Aya fished around in her dress for the said Snail, leaving whatever men that was there to see knocked out from massive nosebleeds. When she finally found it, she answered promptly.

"Mushi Mushi."
"Aya, is that you?"

Back to Haruka...

"That's good, is Sakura with you." Haruka sighed before asking the question at hand.

"Yeah. She and Millie are helping all the men that are passed out from massive nosebleeds."
"What?"
"Well, I didn't have any pockets to hold the Baby Den en Mushi, so I hid it inside my dress.

From Aya's side, the Den Den Mushi suffered from a nosebleed although it wasn't as bad as the others.

"Haruka, are you okay?"
"Yes. I am barely. You know-...nevermind. I'll meet you guys at the castle soon."
"What about Doflamingo?"
"He's not our biggest problem right now."

*clank*

"What was that about?" Sakura asked sounding a bit harsh.
"Dunno, although you should get a Den Den Mushi. It  will be really helpful on our jobs."

"We have some spare ones downstairs. I could give you one." Millie suggested. With that, Sakura nodded in agreement and went with Millie. Meanwhile, sat on the table, playing her thumbs.
