Third person POVRose clenched her teeth in pain as she pushed again and again in till everyone heard a baby's cry, Carlisle picked up a pink blanket that Alice gave to him and put the baby in Rose's arms she smiled and whispered something into the baby's ear "what shall you name her Rose" the mother looked up at her husband and smiled "Kirby" she whispered but everyone could hear her do to vampire hearing,
The baby started to fuss as the family made there way to the living room but soon stopped when Alice froze soon Jasper was by her side "what is it" he asked in a hushed tone "Kirby has a mate"she asked in the same way "who" Rose asked curious "Demetri" everyone gasped at the sudden information "also they want to meet her when the last leaf falls from the tree" everyone looked outside at the October weather which means they only have a couple more months but the baby in Rose's arms already had hair and teeth,
Alice snapped out of her vision and asked if she could hold the baby Rose let out a huff handed her to Alice and walled into the kitchen to get a bottle of animals blood but felt strong arms go around her waist "what are we going to do to" Emmett asked with concern in his voice " we are going to keep our baby" Rose said with confidence in her voice but in the inside she was scarred of what is to become she walked out of her husbands arms and to her baby to feed her.
