For several months, my son Justin and I stayed in a hotel near my parents house. After we decided to return home, I began looking for answers myself. I eventually located a man in the next town over who had a similar story. We got in contact and began talking about our experiences. He knew of two other people in New York who had seen the creature referred to as the rake.
It took the four of us about two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the rake. None of them gave any details, history or follow up. One journal I had an entry involving the creature in its first 3 pages, and never mentioned again. A ship's log explained nothing of the encounter, saying only that they were told to leave by the rake. That was the last entry in the log.
There were, however, many instances where the creature's visitwas one of a series of visits with the same person. Multiple people also mentioned being spoken to, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the rake had visited us before our last encounter.
I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, every, night for two weeks. I would tediously scan through the sounds of me rolling around in bed each day when I woke. By the end of the second week, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed.
