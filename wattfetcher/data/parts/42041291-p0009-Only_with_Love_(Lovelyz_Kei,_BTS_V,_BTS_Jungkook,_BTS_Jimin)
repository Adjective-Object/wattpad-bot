Once he was in the bed I hugged his arm then minutes after I fell fast asleep.
V's POV
After minutes passed I looked at kei and she was sleeping soundly....
I made a frown on my face. I held her cheek with on of my hands.
Your always so pretty......
Then I noticed the actions that I was doing so I backed away.
I tried to let my hands go and it worked. I stood up from the bed and looked at Kei.
Since...we're siblings....we can never be together....
I walked out of her room slowly and went to the living room .

11:00am
My eyes started to open slowly and I stretched my arms and made a soft yawn.
I looked at my side and saw that V wasn't there anymore.
I sighed because knowing V wouldn't stay.
I stood up and brushed my hair then went in the bathroom to wash my face.
I was about to open my door but I heard noises outside.
"We don't have visitors today......who could it be?"I questioned.
"Well, the only way to know is to check it."I said as I opened the door only to see the Bangtan boys making a a lot of noise.
They all noticed me so they went silent.
"Why are you guys here?"I asked as I went downstairs.
I saw V and the others making a big wreck. There was food wrappers on the floor, furniture upside down, and all of their stuff placed around.
"Jiyeon....Were sorry if we made a mess...."Jungkook said.
I sighed as I went towards V. "Its your fault if Eomma gets angry ok."I said as I was about to walk upstairs.
"Don't worry, we'll help V with the mess!"Suga said.
I smiled and bowed.
"Where are you going?"V asked.
"Back to my room."I said.
"Oh, come on...stay here with us."J-hop begged.
"Uh....."I shyly said.
Jungkook knew I was very shy so he pulled me towards him .
"I'll sit beside kei."Jungkook smiled.
"Eh?!!"they all chorused.
"Since when we're you guys so close?"Jin smirked.
I saw V glaring again.
"Hey guys wanna play a game?"Jimin suggested.
"Sure..."We all said.
Jimin sat at the other side of me and smiled.
"How about truth or dare...."
Truth or dare?
Everyone was getting excited.
