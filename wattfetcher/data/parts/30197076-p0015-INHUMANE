"Do You believe in ghosts ?" He Asked Lowly, His Voice Faintly Reaching her Ears.
Tilting her head To Stare At Him, A Look Of Pure Terror Crossed Her Features.
"I Dont Know." She mumbeled, Seemingly Still In a Daze.
A Sharp Intake Of Breath Snapped Her Out Again, Her Neck Snapping To The Doctor's Direction Nearly Getting a Whip Lash.
"Do You See Justin..When You..Use Your Gift ?" He asked, Seemingly Hesitant About It.
He Knew It Could Be Dangerous To Approach Such Kind Of Stuff.
"I Use My Gift, To See Justin." She Answered Back Slowly And Carefully, Making Sure to Pronounce Every Little Word.
"And Do You Both, You know, Talk With Each others ? "
"No." She Retorted.
The Atmosphere Remained Silent Ad Tension Filled The Air For A Couple Of Minuites As The Doctor Refused To Pass The Question Without Getting More...Explanation.
She Paused For a Couple Of Seconds Before Continuing,
"I Always Remained Trapped inside My Old Self, Only Mu Old Self Can Talk To Him And He Would Reply Back, But He Couldnt even See Me. Hell, If I Screamed My Lungs Out, No one Would Hear..It Was Just An Illusion-A Memory That I Couldnt Change, Because ...You Cant Change The Past." She Whispered Lowly, As Flashes Of Memories Passed Infront Of My Eyes.
"Your Old Self ? So You Think You're Someone Else Now ?" He Asked Skeptically.
"Yes." She Answered Vaguely.
"And what Exactly Do You Think Of Your Old Self ?"
"Stupid." She Paused, "Stupid, Naive And Most Importantly..VERY Selfish."
Snapping my Gaze To The Doctor's, She Muttered,
"I Hope You Understand Dr. Vincent That My Gift Isnt That Much Of A Use When It Comes To The Dead, I Just Take People Back To Their Memories And Bring Them Back Again. Nothing More, Nothing Less."
Nodding Approvingly, He Took Off His Glasses And Placed It On the Little Coffee Table Beside Me, Before He Started Rubbing his Eyes Tiredly.
"Am I Tiring You, Dr.Vincent ? " She Asked, Staring At Him Innocently, Though A Ghost Of Smirk Was Slowly Curving At The Side Of Her Lips.
"What ? No No. It's Fine." He Said, Adjusting his Glasses Back On Before Shooting Yet Another Question At her.
"Bree, What Do-"
"I Said..DONT CALL ME THAT !" She Snapped Furiously At Him, Her Eyes No Longer Blank Or expressionless But Had Rather Turned To Anger And Fury With Specks Of Gold Swirling Inside Of Them, Threatning To Take Over The Good Side Of Her.
Her Nails Dug Into The Palms Of Her Hands as She Clutched Her Hands Into Fists Angrily.
Shutting Her Eyes For a Few Sexonds, She Fluttered Them Open Back Again, The Golden Specks No Longer Visible In her eyes Before She Turned To The Doctor And Apologized Lowly.
"It's Fine. I Understand..Brianna." The Doctor Nodded Twice Before He Stood Up, Shuffling Towards His Desk.
He Snatched A Paper And A Perfectly Sharpened Pencil Before Strolling Back To My Direction.
However, Brianna Hadnt Even Bothered To Glance At Him. Instead Her Eyes Were Firmly Glued To The Ticking Clock Infront Of Her, Her Eyes Following The Pointer's Every Movement.
"Brianna ?"
