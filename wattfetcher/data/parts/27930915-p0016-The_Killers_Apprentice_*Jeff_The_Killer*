She's different. And that's definitely why I'm attracted to her.
Lena's POV
He was shirtless again, why doesn't he ever wear a shirt? God, he's got to have one somewhere.
Does it bother you?
No, it doesn't bother me. I respond to my darker side, like a crazy person.
Of course it doesn't bother you, you love it.
What the Hell is that supposed to mean?
You love when he's shirtless. Just like you love touching him, in those small moments where his skin brushes yours, and you cheeks turn bright red.
They do not.
They do. You're attracted to him. Just admit it Lena.
I am not attracted to a serial killer.
You are.
I am not.
You are. It's okay, Lena. You're a killer too, don't forget. You murdered your father, not only that, but you enjoyed it. you enjoyed every second of plunging that knife through him. over and over and over and over again. You're a killer, Lena.
I know. But I'm not like Jeff. Jeff does this like its a damn sport.
You're exactly like him. And it is a sport Lena, This is all just one big game. And you're losing. You're fighting success. Why are you fighting success Lena?
It's not success it's insanity.
And what a beautiful thing it is.
You're crazy.
And you're the one talking to yourself. I am you, Lena. So just know that when I say you're attracted to Jeff. Talking to yourself. This is your mind. These are your words. Fighting with yourself would just be.. idiotic.
You're.. You're right.
No, Lena. You're right.
