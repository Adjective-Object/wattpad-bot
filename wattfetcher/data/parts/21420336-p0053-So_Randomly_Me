Question:
Whats the most embarrassing thing you have done?
Ive done a lot...
But the most embarrassing one
So there is this thing called "slap ass friday" at my school. Basically,Â  you slap peoples butt.
Well, I wasn't going to do it, but EVERYONE KEPT SLAPPING ME
The problem with that is, I'm very competitive.
Very
Very
Competitive.
So when they slapped me I slapped them back.
Lets just say I got caught.
I almost got suspended xD
I regret nothing.
