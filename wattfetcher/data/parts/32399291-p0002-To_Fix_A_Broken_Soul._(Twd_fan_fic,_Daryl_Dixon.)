And maybe because I've grown up around defence and survival. My mother and father were once amazing people. I was thirteen when my mom passed away, I was gonna have a little sister and a beautiful family, but unfortunately she was still born and my mother died from blood loss during birth. Me and my dad were broken from then on, we hardly did anything together like we use to. Things like hunting or them teaching me self defence. That never happened anymore, instead my dad drank like there was no tomorrow, I got abused from it with whatever he saw he could use, I had scars when I was only fourteen, but I kept hope and knew he wasn't himself, the devil on his shoulder took over him.
Age sixteen I stood up and yelled back. I won at some points but it didn't do much. I mentioned mom into it and yet, he still fought. It got worse with when his 'best mate' came into the picture, he brainwashed my dad. He was the devil, he was there ever since mom died and that's why my dad was like this. The best mate...He always had a thing with my mother, but because he didn't get what He wanted- because I stopped him from doing so- He blamed it on me, and my dad went along with it, my dad Says I wanted a little sibling and it was my fault..I did wanted either a sister or brother, But did I ever think she was going to die? Turns out my dad was ill, health problems, he actually came through he saw what he was doing it wasn't easy to convince him but it worked, he still kept in touch with his 'best mate' but from then on he was as soft as he was when I was a kid. That happened at the age 18. We became extremely close.
That's how i ended up in the marines. Slowly I got excepted into the police force first, I was there for only a year when I was moved to the army, I was in wars from all around the world defending my country I got captured, tortured, I had a disgusting body at the age of 19. But I fought and made my way to the marines I was one of the best, my team mates called me the 'assassin' cause of my strong quick, quiet kills. That was the best combination in the marines. But If it wasn't for my dad I wouldn't of been in those places he forced me to go, but how could I leave him alone?
When I got back for a break, my dad wasn't looking the best, he had more grey hair so I told myself it was age. He told me himself he was fine.
We talked and talked till we were fully updated on each of our lives. He still apologises from what he did but I was completely fine with it. He knew everything about me and I knew everything about him. I kept one secret from him, I didn't want him to go through anymore at his age. That secret was the one of the most horrible things that had ever happened to me...and that secret was kept to myself and to the now dead Man I hope.... I've Been raped about 3 times. By my dads best mate... His name was Will. I tried to forget about it but I had night mares about it most nights.. But my fathers relationship now was amazing..I thought things were perfect.
That was until a day later he was complaining about some type of pain in his arm.
I knew what that was straight away.
I rang the ambulance and when I hung up my dad was holding his heart and on the ground screaming Bloody Murder. I tried with the little medical skills I had from the marines to save him but it was to late. "I love you my sweet, please forgive me for what I've done to you, your so strong and I'm so proud of you, take your mothers sword and my knife, never forget about us, it's my time now I know, your mother is waiting for me. I love you.." Those were the exact words he said before he let out his last painful breaths of life.
I was all alone.
And that was when I became the hard quick tempered assassin I am today.
And no one. I mean no one can break down my well built tall walls around me. No One.
