"Because you're Corey's sister! And you're not like him at all. You're sweet and innocent and I absolutely hate those types of girls."
"Then why start with me?" I asked rhetorically and I stood up, walking out of the bedroom. I made my way outside and walked back to my house, where Corey was asleep on the couch. Why was he in the living room?
