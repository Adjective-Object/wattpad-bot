No!!!!! Why! I know this was just the credit song for Equestria Girls but this was my favorite song in the movie! It's so catchy and cute! Anyway if you voted this song out you get to vote again. Oh and before I say the nominees I need to address something. When I say "If you voted this song out you get to vote again" that doens't mean you're out. It means that you can't vote again till the song you voted for gets out. I think that was for confusing people so I hope that helps. Anyway Let's Get Started!And the nominees are:SMILE SONG: A song sung by Pinkie. She sang this song about how she loves seeing all her friends smile. This song was in S:2Ep:18I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY: A song sung by Twilight. She sang this song after she found out that the unknown spell she did changed her friends cutie marks and needed to find a way to fix it. This song was in S:3Ep:13PINKIE'S LAMET- A song sung by Pinkie. She sang this song because she thought that Cheese was trying to take her place. (And then afterwards she finds out that cheese is the colt of her dreams... what cheesepie is awesome!) This song was in S:4Ep:12Good luck to the nominees!
