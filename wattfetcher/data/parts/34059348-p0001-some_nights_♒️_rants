so
my parents were in the kitchen eating while watching tv and a commercial came on about going commando.
so i asked why would anyone want to go commando like ew
my mom said that is was in back in the eighties for the boys to go commando
so i asked,
why? for easy access?
my parents looked at me at the same time with the same surprised expressions and i started laughing so hard omf
so that was a fail... but at least i didn't get in trouble lolol
