When I arrived at school for the first time this year I was greeted by no one. Usually my Melissa and Beatrice are waiting for me so we can walk to home room together but there was no one. I dodged random kids then I finally saw Maddy crying in a deserted hallway. I ran up to her and asked her "Maddy what's wrong?" "Reese just dumped me for that bitch Tess!" She responded though tears. "Omg I am so sorry" I said sympathetically but I knew that he was a cheating lier the first time I met him. I felt so bad for Maddy she deserves someone way better! (Like that guy Jackson who she is always staring at) anyway I finally got Maddy to stop crying then we went to the bathroom to fix her makeup. Which btw was making her look like a zombie/vampire/monster thing. It was NOT a good look. When I got to the bathroom I was sure I had already missed my first class but I was there for Maddy.
