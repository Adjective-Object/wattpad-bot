A warm breathe trickles down my neck. I stiffen in bed, remembering i was alone in the sea of sheets lastnight. I quickly squeeze my eyes shut feeling a movement in the bed. A hand grabs my hip and lightly pinches the thin layer of chub coating my bones. For a brief moment, I sharply inhale as a natural reaction to someone's cold fingers touching the exposed flesh where my tank top rose up. I stay still, afriad of this mysterious cold figure.       I was only staying at Stark Towers because Tony owed me a favor. We had been friends for the past couple years and had let le crash in a spare room, but i know this can't be Tony running long, cold fingers across the layer of pudge coating my stomach. He was faithful to Pepper Potts, his girlfriend. It couldn't be Steve breathing warm air down my neck causing goose bumps rise on my back, because he was still heartbroken over Peggy Carter. It couldn't be Thor's foot lightly bumping into mine at the end of the bed, because Jane held his heart in a death grip. So, who was this?     "Aren't you awake yet, Y/N? You could sleep through a war, my dear!" A voice so familier whispered to my ear in a way that made my heart flutter like a thousand butterflies    "Loki?" I responded quietly. Loki, the brother that Thor speaks so higly of with hope in his voice, that Clint talks about with a burning passion because he attacked New York. The Loki that I never met, but believed he wasn't as bad as some, but worst than most. The one Thor had made me believe was a better man than most know, with wrong choices following every last thread of him, but a heart of gold buried deep inside. "Yes, my dear. Tis I, the big bad wolf," Loki replied with a laugh that many reconized as the laugh that hides pain. I slowly flip over onto my back, falling in to the man's arms spread out. I look into his eye, only to see them full of tears and holding a look that would make the coldest person want to hug him.     I held a hand out and cupped his cheek, offering a smile. He returned another fake smile.   "Loki? What.....What are you doing?" I asked rather confused, just as i had exactly five minutes ago.     "What I'm doing, is loving you how no one has ever loved me. Tenderly and with hugs and kisses. I feel that you are lonely as am I. And...I...I deeply love you from the stories I've heard, and sweet as sugar from what I've observed...in the not perverted way! And I sense great pain in you and i want...to make you better," Loki says now crying, and in that moment, my heart shatters. I pull the man I don't know but from stories close.   "I...don't know what to say but that I don't know why you chose me, but that you love me from stories as i do you. And that I think we should be lonely together," I said, inches from his lips.     "You know, the funny thing is that humans, such as yourself, are imperfect. You have slight layers of fat coating you bones, hair that flies at it's own will, and marks and scars and bruises painted on fragile skin, but I still fell in love you. I realized that imperfectness is the new beautiful and that your intelligence could end the world. I really saw you for the first time, and loved every single inch of you," Loki spoke, with eyes of melting ice.         I cried, full out crying tears for no one ever spoke.    "You know, I should be mad at you for calling me fat, but that was so beautiful I'll forgive you, you @amp;," I replied laughing and rubbing tears from my eyes. He laughs lightly before kissing me. I felt something. Something that could only be described as one thing.
Love. ‚ù§
