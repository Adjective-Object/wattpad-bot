i woke up to jj yelling "get yall asses up, its time to hit the road!" i groan.
i look behind me and see bri asleep. i get up and go to her side of the bed. i squat to where im face to face with her.
"baby girl....wake up" i say moving hair out of her face. she groans. "come on babe we need to hit the road, we have a long drive ahead of us" i say
she uncovers herself and stands up, i stand up with her. she opens her eyes, "good morninh sleepy head" i say grabbing her by her waist .
she wraps her arms around me and burys her face in shirtless chest. "come on baby, gotta get moving" i say.
she pulls apart and walks to the bathroom. i start getting dressed and then bri comes out. "okay! im awake!" she says energetic.
"finally!" i say, she giggles. i walk to the bathroom and brush my teeth and wash my face. i walk out to bri in her lace underwear and bra.
ive seen her like this when we were friends, so it doesnt matter. "bri , you dont know how much i love your body" i tell her in her ear, and nibbling on her neck hugging her from behind.
she giggles. "jack stop it!" she says wacking my arm playfully. i laugh and let her go. she puts on (outfit above).
after we are done getting dress we head downstairs. "everybody ready!" i say. "hell yeah !" sammy said running outside. i hear bri giggle.
we all load our bags and hit the road.____________________-2hrs into the drive-(1hr left)
"road trip!!!" bri whisper yells and points the camera to,jj, and sammy passed out in the back. "well yall arent fun" she says pouting, then the vine ends.
i laugh. "you are so fucking cute" i say. she blushes.
i grab her hand and she smiles. "jack....." i glance at her, because i got to keep my eyes on the road.
"will you be honest with me?" she says. "of course i will"
"ok.......have you always loved music?...like..did you always love to sing?" she asked.
i cant lie to her. its time to tell her.....
"um...babe"
"before you and tristen came to this school.......me and jj were always bullied....we were called faggots , gay lovers, we were told to just die in a hole....it was because....me and jj in middle school were in choir, we loved to sing, we loved music...but we were bullied badly because very very few guys were in choir." i say
"oh my gosh ....baby....im so sorry i didnt know..." she said squeezing my hand.
i let a tear shed , thinking about how i almost commited....until jj stopped me.
"then....in high school we didnt want to be bullied anymore, so... we joined the basketball team in high school, and turns out we were really good at it" i say.
"baby, i promise you , i wont let anybody call you that stuff again, i will knee them where the sun dont shine! you and jj have an amazing voice!" she says.
i smile, knowing i have her support, no matterwhat....
"thanks baby girl, but dont forget i will never let anybody hurt you....ever!" i say , but at i say ever in a british accent. she giggles.i laugh too._______________-pulling up to the lakehouse-(Sabrinas Pov)
