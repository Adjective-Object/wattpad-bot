Riptide was thrilled. Tsunami was coming to the deep palace. He could finally see the love of his life. Finally, after what seemed like hours of waiting, Tsunami came down and greeted Riptide with a flashy ' hello ' Riptide smiled and beckoned for Tsunami to come to the surface which she did. " Come over her Tsunami." Riptide said encouragingly. " Alright, squid brain." Tsunami said laughing. She is gorgeous Riptide thought. They both flew over to a cliff with flowers and trees shading it. It was a PERFECT day and it was sunset! It was as if Mother Nature planed for it to be the perfect time for him and Tsunami to, well, hit it of. " Tsunami... I need to..." Riptide started but was cut off when Tsunami placed her claw under his chin and kissed him. " Oh three moons she loves me! " Riptide thought happily. " So squid, did you see that comin?" she asked, not the least bit embarrassed. " I didn't see it, but I hoped it." Riptide said looking down at the beautiful dragonet. Tsunami again kissed him but was interrupted when Queen Coral yelled, " TSUNAMI KELP PERAL!" " Oh talon, I am dead." Tsunami said. " I WILL NOT HAVE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT SOUNDRAL!" Queen Coral spat. " Well,I think she should love whom she wants to." Auklet said peeping out from behind her mothers wing. " You may be friends, but NEVER more!" Queen Coral yelled. She flew angrily along with her guards. Tsunami looked up at Riptide and said, " Nothing, will tear us apart." The sun set behind the sea and the moon rose cheerfully. " I love you more than anything." Tsunami said. They walked behind a tree and made out for 10 minutes. " Shall we go to Glory?" Tsunami asked, staring at her love. " Yes, but no telling our news." Riptide replied. The 2 dragonets kissed and flew off to the rainforest.
