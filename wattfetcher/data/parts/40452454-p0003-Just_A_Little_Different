" Are you okay?" He outstretched his hands towards me, offering me help.
"Yeah. I'm fine thanks." I smiled in gratitude and took his offer and yet again our eyes met, our hands still in contact with each other. Silence fills the air and too make it less awkward, I nervously remove my hand from his and started a conversation,
"So your Alec Dalton?" I asked with a smile and received a simple nod in reply.
" And your Chantel?"
"You know my name? How?"
I am gob-smacked. How does he know my name. I mean it's only been a week and I'm pretty sure a new student couldn't memorise everyone's name and face in a short period. WEIRD. Wait a minute, I forgot he's a genius.
"Well, err... I-I guessed,"
I nodded, making it seem like a I understood.
"And um, I want to apologise for scolding at you yesterday. I was distracted by something. I'm sorry."
This guy is really something else, I can feel it.
" No, no, no. Don't be. You were right. I guess I should have looked where I was headed. I guess I was distracted myself."
And ladies and gentlemen, Alec smirked and a drool-worthy one too. God, it look so good. My heart is melting. It's irresistible.
