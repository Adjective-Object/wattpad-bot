"We're here." He says.
I look up and groan. I threw my head back and pouted. Not the mall. I just came from here yesterday! Can't we bond somewhere else?
"What's wrong?" He asked a bit confused and worried.
"I came here yesterday. Can napping be a bonding thing?" I asked him as my face scrunched up.
He started to laugh at that. Then my phone went off. I answered my phone without looking at the caller ID.
"Hello? Jaycie speaking." I answered.
"WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU?!?" My brother yelled making me wince.
"I just got at... You know what I don't have to listen to you yell. You better calm down or I will hang up." I answered with a frown.
"I'm sorry you're right." Paul breathed out. "I'm calm. Can you tell me where you are and who you are with?"
"I'm with Chase and we just arrived at the mall. Where's Tessa?"
"Your-. Tessa!" He said.
"You're with Chase? Put him on the phone now!" She exclaimed.
I gave him the phone and since he heard her, he was laughing. He took the phone from my grasp and put it on speaker as he answered.
"Hey Tessa." He answered.
"Did you do it!?! Did you did you did you!?!" She said all in one breath.
"Haha, yes Tessa I did." He says as he lightly laughed.
She screamed. My poor ears. They were hurt from her high-pitched, frequency scream. I covered my ears and frowned.
"Tessa. Calm down. You're hurting my ears and Jaycie's." He said.
"I'm so sorry, but I'm so happy for you guys!" She says.
"It's alright. Where are you?" He asked. "You told me not to hog her, I might change my mind and take her to my house."
He was grinning when he said that. He knew it would get a reaction from her.
"What! No! You absolutely will not! You promised! I'm on my way!" She said.
The line went dead and I laughed at her with him.
"You're terrible!" I say with a chuckle.
"She'll be here soon. Do you want to do anything until she's here?" He asked making me think.
"Lets just talk." I say.

*Tessa's POV*
I hung up before Paul could reach.
"What did he do?!? Did he do what I think he did? Please tell me he didn't!" Paul said.
"Oh he did." His Dad said as he walked in while reading a book a bit.
"He asked her out? How did you know?" Paul asked his dad.
"Because he asked me if he could date my daughter, your sister." He says as he sits down.
"What? You said yes to this?" He asked incredulously.
"Leave it alone Paul." I said. "She'll probably be happier."
"She can be happier with her mate. Out of all the people you chose to let Jaycie date you let her date Chase?!"
"What's so wrong with him Paul?" Mr. Everheart asked as he put his book down with his bookmark in place.
