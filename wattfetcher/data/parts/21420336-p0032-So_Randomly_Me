I still haven't finished my homework...
It's cuz I have to annotate...
From the root word
"ANNOYING"
Gosh she wasn't me to write why this is important
Pshhhhh I only read it cuz she makes me too.
Gosh
Miss. IM GONNA TEACH YOU AT A COLLEGE LEVEL EVEN DOE YOU ARENT AT HIGHSCHOOL YET AND IM GONNA MAKE YOU WRITE REACTIONS AND CONNECTIONS ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE THINGS!
I'm so glad I let that out of my system.
I told my teacher I believe in quality not quantity and she's all like,"Please don't compare us to other teachers, we don't compare you."
Me (in my mind OBVIOUSLY),' I'm gonna compare you if I want too I mean if you suck compared to my other teachers... Than I will compare you. And I bet as soon as you get home your just like,'OMGS THAT KID IS AN IDIOT.'"
I think that's why teachers do
I mean, that's what I do
Gosh I want to ranttttt
Idk what to rant abouttttt
