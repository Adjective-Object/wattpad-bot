"Why are they with the seniors, isn't he the one that sexual abused that girl from our year?" Yeah he was and I'm sure Emily doesn't know a thing about that, she walked up to the bar with Luke,
"What do you want?" Luke asked her, "she'll have a diet coke," I said remembering that she didn't drink because of LA,
"What are you doing here?" She asked, here to save you my love, "just to say hi I guess, what brings you here?" "I'm on a date with Luke," she pierced her lips and rocked back and forth on her feet.
I nodded "Emily are you coming," "yeah," "by the way Luke this is Mark, mark Luke," she said introducing us, "yeah I know," I said as Luke walked away, Emily smiled and turned around to walk away, I grabbed her waist and pulled her agains me, her bum brushed my lower part, and I blushed a little,
My lips brushed her ear before I whispered "if you need me just call me," she nodded and walked away swaying her hips as she did.

"Why aren't you drinking?" Daniel asked, I know he was trying to keep himself distracted as Rose sat with Parker, he had been staring at her for most of the night, yet I have also been staring at Emily, her dress was a tad to distracting, and I didn't like that Luke and every other big here, were undressing her with their eyes,
I have to save her from him, I don't want her being raped, he is a bad person, and I don't know why rose would let her with him, I suppose she doesn't know either,
"Mark, you okay'" Daniel asked I nodded and watched as, all three girls got up yo the dance floor, Emily's legs distracting me I seen Luke go up behind her and start grinding on her, she moved away not liking it,
He turned her around and grabbed her by the hair forcing her lips onto hers, I shot up and ran towards them, she slapped him but that wasn't enough he needed to be put into place,
I punched his left cheek then his right, he feel to the ground and I grabbed his shirt, "the fuck you can touch her," I shouted, by now everyone was watching, "go rape someone else," I spat and grabbed Emily, "you're leaving now," her eyes were glossy and she was ready to protest, "don't Emily, you shouldn't have even talked to him, let alone dress like that," I walked her out and put her in my car, I could smell the drink of her, "did he spike you're drink," she giggled, "no," she slurred, "coke and vodka," I said hitting the car wheel, "oh someone mad," she giggled and pouted, "you're dads gonna kill you," "you can't go home like this,"
I have to be somewhere tomorrow, but I guess I can take her home before I go, it should be fine, shouldn't it? She won't kill me for taking her to our house? Oh how I wish it was still our house.
