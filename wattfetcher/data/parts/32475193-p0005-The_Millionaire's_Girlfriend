"Tesla," I corrected quietly. "A...friend drove me."
"A tesla? Those are expensive. How'd one of your friends afford it? I sure would like to know because obviously I'm doing something wrong."
Mom gave me another look before playfully rolling her eyes and going to chop up some veggies. "Violet was just telling me about someone she met today. I believe she said he was a millionaire."
Oh thanks mom.
"A millionaire? He? What's his name?"
"Austin...Cruise," I said while reaching for the fruit bowl and pulling out a pear. "His dad's a millionaire. He owns like Silver Enterprises or something weird like that."
"Yeah, I've heard of that place. I thought it was french though."
I shrugged, starting to drift away from this conversation. I tried to pull out my phone, but as I searched my pockets I realized that I didn't have it. Where would I have left it?
I went into panic mode.
"Dad, I can't find my phone," I squeaked while standing up and checking the floor to see if it had fallen.
"I'm sure you'll find it, Vi. Do you have homework?"
"Of course," I sighed. It was high school not kindergarten.
"Then go do it. I'm sure you'll find it later."
Ugh.

Why was the doorbell ringing at 7:30 at night?
"I'll get it," I pushed myself away from the dining table and quickly walked to the front door. I was stupid and forgot to look out the window before opening it.
I was actually quite surprised to see who it was.
"Uh...hi," I said while leaning against the door frame slightly. My knees might have given out if I didn't. "W...what are you doing here, Austin?"
"You left this in my car earlier," he said while holding my phone out to me. I've never been so happy to see it in my life.
"Oh my god, thank you," I grabbed it from him and put it in my sweatshirt pocket, "Why didn't you just give it to me at school tomorrow and why are you so dressed up?"
"Going to dinner with my parents and their friends. You were on the way so we stopped."
"Vi, who is it?" Both my mom and dad came over and stood behind me.
I opened the door up more, "This is Austin...the guy I was telling you about."
My mom nudged my dad right in the ribs and gave him one of her cute/playful looks, "Its nice to meet you Austin. Would you like to come in?"
"I actually have to go," he said just after someone honked their car horn. "Thank you though. I'll see you tomorrow, Violet."
"Ok. Bye."
