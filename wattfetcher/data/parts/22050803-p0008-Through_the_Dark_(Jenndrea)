Lauren started to pull up her friend's sleeves, Jenn managed to be okay with it. The brunette winced upon gazing onto Jenn's scarred arm. Parallel burgundy lines streaked across her arms, she just couldn't explain.
"You're going to be alright, kid," Lauren assured, slightly smiling. She always knew something was off about Jenn and she'd known this for a while now, not just from Jenn telling her, but just in everything about her. The fake personality and attitude, the chain smoking, everything.
"That's exactly it, Lauren. What if I'm not? What if I'm always going to just be a degenerating suicidal loser? What if I don't get married or have a family or reconcile with my parents? What if I just die all alone?"
"You won't, Jenn," Lauren said, "you won't." She hugged Jenn even tighter than before. Jenn squirmed deeper into her arms. Fuck, kid, she thought, you'll be alright.
