dear sammy,
you used to tell me that writing works as good stress relief. you used to say a lot of things.
you always made me feel stupid. but that's okay; i actually liked it.
i never spent one moment with where i learned nothing. you've always been smarter than me. stronger than me.
more cold, in some ways. you wouldn't blink once if you had to give something up. letting go comes naturally to you. you're reserved, maybe conceited at times. i still love you.
god dammit, i love you, so wake the fuck up.
