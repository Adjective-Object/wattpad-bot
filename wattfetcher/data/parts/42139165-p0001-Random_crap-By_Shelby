So, hopefully the pic shows.
Yep.
That's me.
Everyone calls me "Ugly" and i probably am.
No one really likes me.
I can be negative at times (and by that, i mean MOST of the time).
I like to day dream; it helps me escape my problems.
My autism sets me apart from how others act, so therefore i am bullied for it.
I don't really have anything else to say at the moment.
