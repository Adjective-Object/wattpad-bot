"Fucking stop!" Seth yells as well. Pain in his voice.
"Take Seth away Calvin" Ashley says. "Lets leave these two alone." She smirks.
Calvin looks so hurt as he pulls Seth away. Seth is yelling and crying.
"Shea I love you!" He yells to me
"God I love you too!" I yell back as Casper rips open my top.
Im crying so hard right now as Casper runs his hands over my body. I keep struggling trying to pull away,
"Casper please stop" I beg, but its no use. He slaps me.
"Shut up!" He yells and I wince.
He rips open my bra and pulls it off of me. His mouth then sucking and kissing at my breasts. I'm crying enjoying none of it. I hear a loud bang upstairs and that doesn't stop Casper. He rips off my my pants and his hands touch my privates in ways I never wanted to be touched..
"Get the fuck off her!" I hear an unfamiliar voice yell. I look up and see a cop pointing a gun at Casper. He stands up slowly the officer runs towards him and cuffs him against the wall. Then starts pulling him away. Another cop walks over to me. I start crying in relief as he unties me. He hands me a blanket and I cover myself.
"C'mon, we'll keep you safe" He whispers as he pulls me upstairs. I see Calvin being put into the back of a cop car as I get to the top if the stairs, I see Ashley getting thrown in on the other side. Casper's on the ground, trying to fight the officer.
I stand there shivering and I spot Seth.
My whole world lights up as I run towards him, the blanket still wrapped around me.
He engulfs me in his arms and holds me tightly against him. My whole body relaxes and I finally know where I belong and who Im supposed to be with.. Right here in Seth Morbin's arms.
