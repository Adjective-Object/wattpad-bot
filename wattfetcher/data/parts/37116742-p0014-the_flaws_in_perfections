Perhaps next time I'll take the northern railroadStraight out of this town I am the girl of constant sorrow
I'm going home To a place I've never been I'm heading back To somewhere I have yet to see
If you miss the train I'm on I'm sorry but I'm gone I have no time to spare
When will I find what I'm searching for?
