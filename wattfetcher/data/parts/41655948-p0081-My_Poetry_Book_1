What's going through your head
When you think of me at 1 a.m.?
When you lie awake in your bed,
I know you think of me.
And you're trying to hold onto the last thread
Of your sanity.
I know you
And you know me
So do you see stars, galaxies, the moon, too
When you look into the darkness
That surrounds you,
With me on your mind?
Because it happens to me all the time.

I love the vibe to this one so much.
