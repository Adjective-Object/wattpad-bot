Donnie sat up with you latched onto his bandana straps crying your eyes out. You were after all scared out of your mind.
"Hey it's ok the bad guys are gone now." he said trying to reassure you.
"I'll take her Don." April offered trying to pry you away from your new found daddy.
You screamed louder as she took you from Donnie and refused to let go of his strap.
"It's alright April I'll take her. I should check her out at the lab anyway to see if she's ok." he said taking you back.
You instantly calmed down and snuggled into his plastron, while he smiled down at you with his adorable gap. He started to take you back to the lair when he noticed the pin on your shirt.
"(Y/n)... What a cute name."

Mikey was perfecting some of his tricks in the park, when he noticed Rahzar and Fishface coming out of an alley with you in a small bag.
"How do people find these things cute?" Rahzar groaned slinging the bag you were in over his shoulder.
"Better question is why does shredder want the brat anyway?"
You screamed in the bag and thrashed around as it started to swing violently. The top of the bag opened and Mikey smiled down at you. "Hey there little dudette, you ok?"
You stopped crying and looked up at him curiously as he took you out of the bag carefully.
"I think I'll call you (y/n)! What do you think dudette?"
You smiled and started gnawing on his bandana straps. Mikey giggled and cuddled you. "I'll take that as a yes."
He stood up straight and started for the nearest manhole. He couldn't wait to show his brothers his new baby!
