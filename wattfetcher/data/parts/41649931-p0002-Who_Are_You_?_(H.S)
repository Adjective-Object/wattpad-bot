" Hey Girl " Crystal said smiling back.
" Hey Katy " I said smiling back at her too .
" Lets go buy drinks so we can go shopping " Crystal said , Katy and me nodded . We walk towards the line which only had like two people infront of us . I looked down at my shoes waiting till it was our turn .
" Next " said the cashier .
I walked up to the counter and ordered a Venti Doble Chocolate Chip Frappe and waited a side so my friends can order there drinks . It took a lot longer because Crystal was flirting with the cashier . I will admit the cashier was kinda cute . Well done Crystal .
When she was done flirting they exchanged numbers and said their goodbyes .
" Look who got the cute guys number " Crystal said smiling . " He called me beautiful "
Of course he will I mean Crystal is beautiful . She is tall , skinny , her skin was almost pale and had light brown eyes with red hair that fell just past her shoulders .
" He was cute " Katy said and Crystal nodded . We waited for our drinks and as soon they were done we headed out of Starbucks to go shopping . We entered Areopostale and started to look for clothes .
I picked up a pink shirt with a little bit of glitter on top of the letters which spelled ' Areopostale '
" This is cute " I said and showed the shirt to Crystal and Katy .
" It is " Katy said and Crystal nodded . I walked towards the sweatpants because I needed some more , they are so cumfy . I picked a blue one , a grey one , and a green one .
I headed towards the counter to pay for my stuff but on my way there I bumped into something hard , I looked up to see a tall man with curly brown hair with a hat looking down at me . He had sunglasses on so I couldn't see his eyes . He has tattoos on his chest and I couldn't help but stare .
" Sorry " I said and he nodded,with that he just left .
" Hey who was that sexy guy ? " Obviously Crystal asked.I shrugged
" I don't know , I bumped in to him on accident " I said saying the truth .
" Did you get his number ? " omg Crystal .
" No i didn't " I said and she just nodded . We went to pay for our clothes so we can go into other stores.
