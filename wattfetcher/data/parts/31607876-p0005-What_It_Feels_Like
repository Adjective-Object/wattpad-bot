Everyday at school when they all laugh at you.
You know what hurts?
Everyday when you try your absolute best and it still isn't good enough.
You know what hurts?
Everyday waking up and wishing you hadn't.
You know what hurts?
Everyday putting a smile on your face when you just want to curl up and cry.
You know what hurts?
Everyday pretending like you're happy when you just want to die.
