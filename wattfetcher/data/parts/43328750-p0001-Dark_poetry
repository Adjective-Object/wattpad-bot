Strong hands pulling you away from everything you know A silent scream that no one can hear One hand on your mouth One hand moving down
Your world ripped apart before your eyes Everything you once knew: gone Denial, shame Oh what a lovely game
Hello where'd my childhood go It's been snatched before my eyes Everyone's crying But no one sees me
You can't print flyers asking for it back It isn't something broadcasted on the news Something been taken from you, something you should never lose so soon Your world soon turns inside out
You're not a kid anymore Your mother and father no longer matter You've gotten older too fast Your heart has gone cold
-But what do you expect when your kidnapper steals your home.
