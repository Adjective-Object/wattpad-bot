There are so many things wrong with this review. Just.... asdfghjkl.
First. Listening to this music does not change you, unless you want to change.
Second. Your hair will NOT grow overnight. Especially not into a bullshit emo look. Especially since emo as a whole is bullshit.
Third. People do not cut themselves because of this music. People don't typically let people know they're even cutting themselves unless they're attention whores. Typically, it's because they don't know any other way to cope, you fucktard.
Fourth. Listening to this music will not make you gay, or straight. Your sexual preference is your own fucking choice, not to be determined by the music you listen to. Anybody who thinks that listening to My Chemical Romance will make you gay can go fuck themselves up the ass with a flaming cactus.
Fifth. Back to my point on why people think the world sucks, it's cause of how others treat them, or mental conditions. Depression can happen to anyone. Doesn't mean it's cause of the music they listen to. It's even been scientifically proven to be hereditary, meaning you can get it from your parents. So suck on that, fuckers.
Moral of this rant, these three people are full of shit. It's that simple.
This all has made me so pissed off that I'm TWITCHING. Gah....
