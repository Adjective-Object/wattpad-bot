I rush over to get my bag that's at the end of the bed. I hear my mom call my name from down the hall.
"Kira hurry up. You will be late for your first day of school!"
"Im going"
I put my converse on and head for the door. I get in the car and we drive towards Endeavor High, my new school. My mom and I came to California in the beginning of summer from Chicago. We only brought our SUV stuffed with a mattress, some clothes we tossed in a big suitcase, and a microwave. We did not want to spend another second in Chicago. I don't even think we can go back there anymore, not after what happened. We were in a rush to leave Chicago and my mom found a house here on Craigslist so we dipped and now we're here. Im nervous for today, I hope I can make some friends, well at least one. I had to lose contact with all of my friends, it's better to be safe than sorry. I sigh when my mom pulls over and drops me off. I tell her goodbye and head towards the gates. I pass by a group of boys having a rap battle. This school cannot get any weirder.And I spoke too soon...by the gym I assume are two people basically fucking. Wtf. The bell rings to my relief and I find my schedule in my bag. First period Anatomy. Great now I have to listening to immature guys talking about body parts. I walk in and take a seat next to a guy with blonde hair and blue eyes. He has on a white t-shirt, black jeans, and white converse. He actually looks really nice for the first day of school. I guess he saw me looking at him because when I look up he smiles at me. I blush and quickly take out my binder.
"Hey I'm Niall", he says with a cheeky smile. Is he talking to me? I look at him and he is staring at me, well I guess he is.
"Hi I'm Kira"
"Thats a cute name", Niall says with a grin.
"Thanks", I say and smile
I don't even know him and he calls me cute, we'll at least my name.
The teacher goes over the rules for his class over a powerpoint while we write them in our notebooks. The class goes by fast and the bell rings. I hurry to put my stuff in my bag and walk out the door. I look over my schedule,next class :Pre-Calculus. Now where the hell is that. When I came for my orientation with my mom and the administrator was showing us around I wasn't paying attention, and now I have to walk around like a lost puppy. I hear a voice call my name and I turn around.
"Umm...do you need help finding your next class?", Niall says shyly. YES YES YES! THANK YOU!
"Yeah thanks", I say as calmly as I can and tell him that I have math next. He starts walking and I follow him.
"So Pre-Cal huh? I have AP Statistics this year. I think it might be easier than Pre-Cal. Everyone says that the class is hard and the teacher is strict".
" Well way to shit on my parade", I say hoping he gets my sarcasm. He laughs and says
"Sorry...so how do you like this school so far?"
Should I tell how I really feel? That its weird and this school is the last place I want to be right now. Maybe not, he might have school pride or something.
" It's pretty cool, people here are really nice". I hope he believes that because that was a bunch of bull.
"It mostly depends on who you hang out with. Some of these kids are cool and some are jerks. But I think you will find some good friends", Niall says and we stop in front of my class."Anyways I have to go to English class, how exciting! I'll see you later Kira, have fun in math",he says and walks away. Great now I can put that in my book on How To Get A Guy From Ever Talking To You Again.
"Thanks have fun..." in your class ...and he's gone.
I enter my class and sit down. The teacher introduces herself as Mrs.Page and talks about how she spent the summer in Canc√∫n. She doesn't seem so bad from what Niall said. Then she tells us that we have a warm-up with 10 problems that we have to solve in five minutes. And I spoke too soon yet again. I try to do the problems but I can't focus. All I can think about is Niall, his Irish accent, his blonde hair, his eyes, his smile,his laugh. But he drifts from my mind completely when I get to my next class.
