AN: just like my other stories, I'm switching this one to samantha's point of view permanently. Sorry for any inconvenience it may cause.
I rolled over the next morning and found Johnny 's lips on mine. We kissed for a while before we needed to breath.
"I can get used to that." I said. Johnny smiled weakly and pressed a hand to his head.
"So can I. God my head hurts." He whispered. I smiled sympathetically.
"Yeah you kinda had a lot to drink last night. Want something for the pain?" I asked. Johnny whimpered which I took as a yes. I got out of bed and went to my luggage. I pulled out a bottle of aspirin and sat back on the bed by Johnny. He took the bottle and got two pills out. I got him a bottle of water and he took the pills. "Better?" I asked.
"No." Johnny said. He rolled over and covered his face with the pillow. I giggled.
"Come on. Once you get up and moving it should be better." I coaxed. I heard Johnny groan.
"I don't wanna." His voice was muffled by the pillow. I smiled and laid back down with my head on his chest.
"Please? Today is our last day together. We leave tonight." I whispered. I wasn't sure if he hears me. Then I felt him sigh and felt the pillow move.
"When you put it that way." He muttered. I was upset we had to leave. I didn't know what I was gonna do without Johnny. I really loved him so much.
"Johnny?" I asked. I hugged him close to me. His arms went around me and held me close.
"Yeah?" He responded.
"What are we gonna do?" I asked. I was afraid I'd lose him after today.
"I planned on laying in bed with you all day." He said. I smiled.
"Not what I meant." I said.
"Oh. You meant after tonight. I'm not entirely sure Samantha. I'll be in los Angeles and you'll be in Chicago. That's a country apart." He sighed. I buried my head in his neck.
"I don't want to lose you Johnny." I said. Johnny held me tighter.
"Neither do I. You mean way too much to me." He said. Johnny and I spent the rest of the day in bed together. We just talked about whatever. Things we wanted to do, where we wanted to go, what our relationship would mean. Little things. Soon it was getting dark and we were packing up. Tears were in my eyes. I was done packing and I held Johnny 's beanie tightly. His shirt was across my lap and I was waiting for him. We'd be going to the airport together but my plane left an hour before his. In three hours, I'd be separated from my love. Tears started to fall and I quickly wiped them away. I didn't want Johnny to see me crying.
"You okay?" Johnny asked. His voice had cracked. I looked up to see his eyes were slightly red. I shook my head.
"No." I said. Johnny sat down next to me and pulled me into a hug. I wrapped my arms around his neck tightly and let my tears fall.
"Neither am I. I don't wanna break up with you. But I'm not sure if we can make this work." He said. I nodded.
"We can try. Please don't make me face the world alone. I need to know I still have you." I sobbed. Johnny nodded.
"I know. I know. That's why I'm not. Come on, dry those tears. We still have three hours before you leave." He said. He wiped away my tears and smiled at me. I pushed my hair out of my face and nodded.
"Three hours. That's not a lot." I said. Johnny shrugged.
"We better make them count them shouldn't we?" He said. I smiled.
