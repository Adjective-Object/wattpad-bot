Haruka: Its not funny!
Ace: I'm back with the guest..*sees everyone laughing* What's with them?
Me: Nothing, Welcome Bartolomeo!
Bartolomeo: Thank you for inviting me, Sakura-san. Is Luffy-senpai here?
Sakura: Yeah, he's here. Now to get down to business. *gets pen and notepad* Let's start naming all possible ships in this book starting with you.
Haruka: Oi, what kind of meeting is that? Then what are we fucking doing here?
Sakura: For a reason, now go ahead Barty.
Bartolomeo: Well, I have: LuffyxAya, LuffyxSakura.
Luffy: *As clueless as ever*
Aya: Where the fluff did these ships come from?
Sakura: Fangirl Community.
Aya: You know you're there right?
Sakura: Like I give a damn. The only reason why that ship is there because of the name Luffy calls me.
Bartolomeo: Then we have AcexHaruka.
Ace: *spits out tea*
Bartolomeo: AcexSakura.
Sakura: *spits out water* What the hell is THAT ship for!
Aya: Now that ships makes sense.
Haruka: How dare you try to steal my ship!
Ace: I kinda like that ship better.
Sakura: I don't think of Ace that way.
Bartolomeo: Oh yeah, then why did you allow him to see you bathe and change.
Sakura: 0/////0 Baka. It's not like that. Ace is like a big brother to me.
Robin:That face says says otherwise.
Bartolomeo: Oh  Robin-senpai is here! Next, HarukaxRobin.
Haruka: *spits out tea*
Janitor: What the hell! Stop spitting out tea! I'm the one who has to clean it!
Sakura: Sorry.
Bartolomeo: Also we have, HarukaxSakura.
Both: 0.0 wut?
Sakura: I DEEM THAT SHIP ILLEGAL!
Haruka: ME TOO!
Aya: I can see all the cute little babies!
Haruka: WHAT ARE YOU?  A FUCKING MIRAJANE STRAUSS?
Aya: *slap*
Sakura: I will never allow myself to be shipped with that demonic piece of shit.
Haruka: Agreed.
Bartolomeo: HarukaxAya.
Sakura: Now that one makes sense.
Aya: Shut up!
Bartolomeo: And that are all the semi-canon ships for this book. Oh, wait I forgot one.
Sakura: Which is?
