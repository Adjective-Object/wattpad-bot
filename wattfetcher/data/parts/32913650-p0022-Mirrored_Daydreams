- SHELBY'S P.O.V. -
Sam and I walked to our room as we said goodnight to Gavin and Clarissa, Sam turned on the T.V. and we lay beside each other just watching a cheesy drama movie. "Hey Shelby?" Sam whispered. "Yeah?" I asked, looking at him. "I love you." He said, smiling. "I love you too, Sam." I said and I got butterflies. Sam and I have been together for awhile now and I hope that doesn't end anytime soon. Sam kissed my forehead and he went back to watching T.V. "Do you remember when we first met?" Sam asked, smiling. "The most dumbest I've ever looked to you." I said, laughing. It was junior year in high school and I was dancing with all my friends in a weird manner, but I didn't care... That was until Sam walked up to me and asked if I was drunk. "It wasn't dumb but it was funny." Sam said, laughing. I remember being so embarrassed because I had a major crush on him and he was with all his football friends. "No, I looked stupid!" I said, still getting warmth in my face from embarrassment. Sam pulled me in for a cuddle and shook his head. "No... It was cute." I giggled and kissed his cheek. He smiled and he then fell asleep soon after. I stayed up texting the girls and Clarissa said to sneak out to the little beach because she has something important to tell us. I snuck out from Sam's arm and walked out to the little beach where Claudia, Hannah, and little Clarissa were all sitting in the sand. "What happened?" I asked as I sat down. Clarissa giggled and whispered. "Guess what Gavin asked me earlier..?" She had a little smirk on her face. "Did he finally ask you out?!" Hannah whisper yelled. Clarissa nodded her head. "OMG!" I whisper yelled too. "Finally," Claudia said, laughing. "Guys, I'm so happy because I really like Gavin and I never thought a guy like him would like someone like me." Clarissa explained. "Dang." I whispered. "Earlier, Sam and I were reminiscing on how we first met." I laughed. "Adam and I laid down and talked about life and ugh. He's just so perfect." Hannah said smiling. "Me and Edgar watched some weird horror movie and cuddled." Claudia said. We all continued to talk about our boyfriends until we heard a crackle in the rocks, as if someone were out here. "Damn it Sam, you messed up our whole cover." We heard Adam "whisper" yell. "Actually, you blew y'alls cover, Adam!" Hannah yelled. The guys came out of some bush and attacked us with hugs and kisses. "I appreciate you saying I have nice abs, babe." Sam whispered jokingly in my ear. I felt my face burn and I laughed it off.
- CLARISSA'S P.O.V. -
All the guys ran out of the bushes and attacked us. Gavin ran up to me and hugged me and he said he appreciates me calling him really cute. "Why did you guys spy on us?" I asked, pretending to be upset. Gavin noticed my face and his smile turned into a frown immediately. "Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to interrupt anythin-" I cut him off with a kiss. "Yeah, mhm," I said, pulling away from the kiss. "We were just kinda worried when we felt y'all leaving the bed and when we couldn't find you guys, we came out here to look for y'all but instead we heard you guys talking about us and we planned an attack." Sam explained. We all laughed and walked back inside to our rooms. I hugged the girls good night and Gavin took my hand and we locked our door. "I don't trust the guys with all their pranks while I'm asleep," Gavin said, laughing. "Plus, more privacy." He smiled, getting into the bed beside me. I plugged my phone into the charger and put on some calm music. "Kiss Me" by Ed Sheeran came on and Gavin laughed. I laughed too, thinking of the irony. "That kiss you gave me earlier was amazing, by the way." Gavin whispered. "Good." I whispered back. I rested my head on his chest with his arm around me. "Thanks for today, by the way." I whispered. "It's no problem, as long as it's for you." Gavin said. I smiled and kissed him one last time. "Goodnight." I said. "Goodnight to you too, beautiful."
'As long as it's for you'Kept playing in my head until I finally fell asleep...
