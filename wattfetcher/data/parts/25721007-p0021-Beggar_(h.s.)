"Can we please talk?" Zayn immediately asks me when I walk to the kitchen. We're the only two awake right now in the apartment. I'm not sure how to respond so I stay silent and grab an apple.
"Please," he speaks again. Zayn sounds so.. desperate. I kind of feel bad for him. So I answer with a nod and follow him to the couch.
"I'm sorry," Zayn apologized and I rolled my eyes.
"Okay," I simply said. I'm not going to accept any apology until he actually can explain himself. Zayn huffed at my short answer.
"I know, I have some explaining to do. So hear me out okay?" he begged and I nodded, "The night of the party, when Harry and I were arguing, it was about you-"
"Why me? What have I done?" I am not sure why the two could possibly be fighting about me at a damn party. I have done nothing wrong, I'm positive.
"It's not what you have done," he sighed like I'm clueless.
Well.. I am.
"Then why would you two be arguing about me?" I huffed. This whole situation is confusing me.
"Isn't it obvious?" he asked and I shook my head no, "We like you."
Am I hearing things? Two college men, out of all people, like me. I'm nothing special. This is all too much for me to handle.
"No," I say.
"Yes, it's true," he gave a small smile, "I liked you the first time I laid eyes on you. You were so breathtakingly beautiful."
"But.. I was a homeless girl. How could you like a bum?"
"It's not who you were, Lennon. It's your personality," he rolled his eyes. This seems something like someone would say from a movie.
Zayn is so sweet. Even though he was an asshole to me before, he was always a caring guy. Though, I can't seem to develop and feelings for him. All I see is a curly haired guy.
"Zayn," I sighed.
"Believe me, please," he pleaded. I couldn't break his heart like this. Not right now. He likes me, possibly loves and I don't have the guts to say that I don't.
"Look-"
"I know.. I took you from Harry and-"
Took me from Harry? I don't understand what's going on. I'm not his, does Harry think I'm his? This is all too much.
"Wait, what?"
"Oh he didn't tell you the story?"
Story? What's going on? Why am I so clueless to this?
"What story?"
"Enough Zayn!" Harry's boomed throughout the apartment. I peered over to where the voice was coming from. Was he listening the whole time?
"What's going on Harry?! Tell me everything, right now!" I shouted. I'm beyond mad that I haven't been aware of what's been going on in this apartment.
"I'm not telling you shit, Lennon! There's nothing to be said!" Harry barked and I jumped back a little. Here we are, all the way back to the same thing.
"Fine, then I'm leaving. I'm tired of this constant back and forth of you being a complete jerk then kissing me and then back to the same thing over and over again. If I would've known I had to deal with this crap then I wouldn't of moved in here," I yelled.
"You guys.. kissed?" Zayn spoke out of no where. I forgot the guy was even here.
