"Nic" Meek said
He took his eyes off the rode and looked over at her. She was looking out the window as tears fell from her eyes.
Meek parked his black Bentley in his garage right next to Nicki's white Range Rover she had drove over there 2 days ago.
"Nicki" Meek said but before he could continue she was already out the car
Meek stayed in the car for a bit and watched her walk to the door in the garage that led to his huge basement. He took the keys out of the ignition and grabbed his phone, he also picked up Nicki purse and phone and took it inside.
Meek walked through the basement and looked around but he quickly ran up the steps when he saw that the door leading to the 2nd floor was open. The 2nd floor was where the kitchen, living room, family room, and a bathroom was. He realized that Nicki probably went upstairs to his room so he went up the flight of stairs and walked to he had reached his destination. There she was.
Nicki was laying on Meek's California King bed in fetal position. Meek put her purse on his dresser and sat both of their phones right beside it. Nicki has her head in her arm so Meek didn't know if she was up or not. He took the blanket from the edge of the bed and put it on her. He put his big finger in her hand and her tiny little fingers gripped it.
"I'm so sorry baby but Im here if you wanna talk" Meek said kissing her cheek
