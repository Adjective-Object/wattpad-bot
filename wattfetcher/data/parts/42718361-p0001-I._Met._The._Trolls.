I ran out of the house, tears streaming down my face. Mom was drunk (again) and "Dad" wasn't even't back from work yet. My long caramel hair whips me in the face as I make my way down the back porch steps. I failed. I pick myself up off the muddy ground and continue running. The tears kept coming.
I finally stopped out of breath and flopped on the ground near one of the many trees surrounding me. I put my face in my hands and continued to cry.
===========What had happened==========="Sadddyyyyyyyy" Mom called from the kitchen. 'Uh oh,' I thought. 'I know that tone of voice...'"Sadddyyyyyyyy" she called again, her voice sickeningly sweet. I put down my tablet and cautiously peeped my head around the curtain to the kitchen. As I suspected, her hands are full with her drink and cigarette. Her figure was coming towards me with difficulty staying balanced. She pitches over to her left and I run over to stop her from falling over."Do you know why I called you in here Sadddyyyyyyyy?" She asks, peeling herself off of me and and griping the stove for support."Um... no..." I answered, afraid of what might come next.She dropped her cigarette and grabbed the collar of my shirt. "Because I need to tell you what a pain in the ass you are. Just, don't mind me, living in my room, my only friends are on the internet. Not to mention, all the fandoms that I can't tell you about because you wouldn't understand!" She tried to mimic my voice with a high pitch girly one. Her face was really close to mine. It took all my courage to not turn away from her liquor smelling breath."I'm such a fangirl!" She continued. "I'm head over heels in love with fictional characters because no one loves me here! How I wish I could escape this place called reality." She finished her sentence with force. She shoved me away and took another swig of her drink. I started to get tears in my eyes. "W-why sh-should I believe y-you?" I manage to stutter out without completely breaking. She grabbed me again, this time by my hair. "Because I'm your fucking mother, and you're gonna fucking do as I fucking say." She slapped me across the face. Hard. It took all my effort not to start crying. I thanked god the other two kids were asleep.She yanked my hair and tightened her grip. I let out a small whimper. "And I want you to get a real fucking life." She let go. I guess I didn't have enough effort in me, because tears began to cascade down my face. She slapped me again. "I didn't raise you to be wasted crybaby!" Her voice raised a little. Blood started coming from my lip."I-I'm s-s-sorry..." I whisper. She stares down at me, her nostrils flaring."You better be! Now go! Before I start pulling punches." She turned her back and I ran, grabbing my hoody before running out the screen door.===========Back to present===========I wiped my lip. I leaned up against the tree. The flow of tears was slowly coming to a stop. The night air was chilly so I wrapped my arms around me tighter. My black hoody wasn't very thick but I still felt warm. Hugging myself just comforts me, sense I don't have the mom willing to hug me right now...I pull out my phone. It doesn't work here, considering we're so near the Canadian boarder, but I have plenty of music downloaded. I shove my headphones in and relax to sound of Hatsune Miku telling herself, Baka, Baka, Baka! I look up in the sky. The stars were out and twinkled. I looked up at the tree I was leaning against. I get up.It's my favorite tree I like to climb! I can tell because of the hand made scale mates hanging from its branches. I shrug and start to climb.I start climbing and nearly kick off the hammer and box of nails off as I climb. "Oh shit..." I mutter under my breath. "That was close."I continue climbing until I find my favorite branch I like to sit on. It was just wide enough for one other person to fit if I would let them. It was also very high up off the ground and was not easily spotted by people who may be looking underneath.I sigh and relax against the trunk. One of my feet dangles off the side as the song changes. Luka was now filling my ears with the hate she has for herself, considering she's the circus monster. I hum along as I open up a game and start playing it.An hour or two must have passed like this. I checked the time on my phone. "Fuck. It's 1 am. Welp, gonna have to see if I can sneak in again. I hate being without my WeeFee." I quickly make my down the tree and start walking in the direction if the house. I couldn't see it from here but my phone told me which way to go by gaining more internet signal.I arrived at the back door of the house. I was only staying here for a couple more days. Mom wanted me so badly. I was staying with my grandma in La Conner for the school year, so I could go to France with the elementary PE teacher. Wippee.I tried to slide the door open, but to my luck there was no avail. "Well shit! Now where am I gonna sleep?" I look around and see a blue blanket and a beige pillow on the ground. "Fuck! No way am I sleeping out here in the woods!" But, having no better ideas, I pick up the items on the ground and start heading back to my tree. "Maybe I can get WeeFeez out there..."
