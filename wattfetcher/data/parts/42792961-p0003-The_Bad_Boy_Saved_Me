Later in the day, my friends and I met up for lunch, "oh my gosh, I know right and she doesn't even look good in it." Cleo added to the conversation about Julia, one of the popular girls in the grade, "I mean seriously, who wears neon in the fall anyways.""I totally agree." Andrea nodded her head as she took a bite out of her plum. I didn't talk much in the conversation about Julia for two reasons;1) I don't care so much about fashion and;2) all I could think about was that freak of a neighbour.Obviously my friends noticed because they asked what was wrong, "nothing, I'm just not in the mood." they both gave me a confused and worried looked."Um, excuse me? What's going on girl?" Cleo asked snapping her finger with a sas tone in her voice. I just shrugged, "fine don't tell me, I mean us."A long time passed with no talking, this was usual. Every single time I never tell them something they won't talk to me until I tell them. I sigh and they look up expecting me to talk, I just chuckle."Come on, Ray, tell us." Andrea pleaded giving up on staying quiet. I knew she really wanted to know because she called me Ray. Ray is the nickname they use to show mercy and 'the white flag' as in, they give up and they're desperate.I role my eyes and sigh once more, "fine," there was a huge smile on both of there faces, "Okay, there's this new guy at our school and he lives across the street from me-""Ooooo." they say together making me blush a little."Not like that okay, let me finish!" They giggle, "so anyways, he won't tell me his name-""Does he know yours?" Cleo asked."Yes but-""OMG! I can't even!" Andrea screams waving her hands like a fan in her face."He said he won't tell me his name unless I kiss him." I say really fast, then our table went quiet and my two friends were now staring at me."Eeeeeeek!" they both scream which made my ears hurt, like ow! BeeeepLunch is over... we all say bye to each other and I head to my next class, math.
