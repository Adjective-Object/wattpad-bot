She looked suspicious.
"Chase did they tell you what they were?" She asked.
"Yeah but I didn't know what it meant until Tania told me." I replied.
"Tania told you what they were. What did they call themselves?" She asked.
"Hunters. I don't communicate with them though. I promise." I said.
"Chase. You don't have to. They usually don't teach humans they teach the half breeds like half human half wolf people who hate full breeds like me. They watch the humans they teach." She looks around.
"Jaycie. Don't worry, they aren't here. I promise you this. My family and I left without them knowing. They hadn't known. Plus we drove and flew back here. We were only there to visit. Also the family that's there doesn't like them so they never told them." I say keeping her close. "Plus I could never let harm come to you again. I'll protect you with all my strength."
She grinned. "I bet you I am stronger than you." She said only now she was smirking.
"Are not." I said with a grin of my own.
"Are to." She said with a huge smile. "Soon I will be even stronger because I'll be a full werewolf. I'll be able to have my strength plus my wolfs."
"You want to see sweet heart?" I asked her whispering in her ear.
She shivered.
"Sure lets see you lose." She said as she recovered from the shiver.
I just chuckled and I instead started to kiss her neck.
"Chase." She gasped.
"Mhmm." I murmured as I slowly continued to kiss her.
Her eyes were shut when I looked at her. I grabbed her hands and kissed the corner of her lip. She slowly put her arms around my neck as I slowly put my hands on her waist. Then I kissed her. She responded quickly to me and we were there kissing one another. We weren't making out which I was fine with. I want to take it slow on her. When she pulled back she put her forhead on my shoulder.
"Are you okay, Jaycie?" I asked her.
