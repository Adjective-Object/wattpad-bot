[{Authors note: this really is how my brother and I are so if you're reading this and you're like "this is not how siblings act!" I want you to know this really is how I act with my brother ! Like when we're talking on the phone or we see eachother we'll hug and be like "hi love!" "Hey honey." "I love you." "I love you more!"}c
