Once I processed what the doctor had said, I could barley breath. I was alone all because I never told anyone I loved them. "Love" was never in my vocabulary. I was alone.
I looked up at the kind doctors face with tears in my eyes, I was barley able to choke out, "I am alone." Before the sobs broke lose. However I stopped my crying once I felt the crack in my heart breaking even more. I looked down at my chest and felt pain, so much pain I let darkness overcome me once again.

When I woke up I saw that I was in a place named, Ms. Betty's Orphanage For Girls. Little did I know that this new place would be my home for the next decade.
