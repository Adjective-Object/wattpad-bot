"Ummmm...  It was Jenny."
"Jenny who?"  Lakyn asked.
"Jenny Hamilton."  I replied.
"Does she know that you are Beta?"  They both asked.
"No, no one knew.  I found this out a few minutes before you all arrived.  He surprised me with it.  It was an early birthday present."  I replied.
Tessa's eyes widened with happiness.
"It's your birthday soon?"  She asked and I nodded.
"Really?!?  OMG!  I can't wait!"  She said making Lakyn and I laugh or chuckle at her reaction.
"When is it?"  Lakyn asked.
"Next month on the 9th."  I replied.
"October 9th, correct?"  Lakyn asked.
"Yes."
"Today's the 24th so we have about a two weeks?"  Tessa asked.
"Yeah.  When are your birthdays?"  I asked.
"I just turned 18 about a week ago."   Lakyn responded, but he had a smirk.  "How old are you Paul?"
"Why?"  I asked looking at him with a raise of my eyebrows.
"Because I thought I heard your father say that you were only a year older than Jaycie and Jaycie is only 15?  Am I right?  Tessa is 17 and she turned 17 on the 21st which was three days ago."  Lakyn says with his smirk and I realize that my mate is a few weeks older than me.
Tessa then freezes.  "What?"
"Tessa, you never told me you liked guys who are younger than you."  Lakyn said with a grin.
"Shut up, Lakyn!  I didn't ever say that.  That's what the fates supplied to me and I don't care.  He's mine and that's that."  Tessa said.
Lakyn put his hands up in surrender.
"Okay, okay."  He said.
Then we moved on to another subject and I wondered what Greg and them were talking about.
__________________________
*Greg's POV*
After Chasten was done making fun of Lakyn I interrupted to talk to them.
"Lets tell each other funny and embarrassing stories later.  Chelsea, Chasten, if we may."  I say making a motion to the door
"Oh no, I couldn't.  Go ahead."  Chelsea said waving her hands as if it was fine not to let her go.
"It's completely fine, Luna Chelsea.  Please.  I think they should get to know each other anyway.  Also I have a few things to ask you as well."  I replied.  "Plus I respect that mates don't like keeping things from one another, so it would be easier for Alpha Chasten and I to just let you come."
"Come on Chelsea.  He's fine with it.  You can see the treaty before they roll it up.  Tessa, make sure Lakyn doesn't start anything.  Both of you get along as well.  Oh and Beta Paul."  Chasten said getting my Beta's attention since he wanted to know what I wanted to talk to them about.
"Yes, Alpha Chasten?"
"Make sure Lakyn keeps his hands to himself other wise he might just mess the treaty up.  Lakyn is a dork, but I think you already knew that."  Everyone, but Lakyn laughed.
Lakyn had a pout on his face which made Tessa and Paul laugh even louder.
