Prologue
"HELP ME!!" Said 15 year old Kai in the living room looking traumatized. "IS ANYONE THERE!!" I need to get outta here! Kai thought but then they would find the body and that can't happen. "I have to find Aunt September!!" Kai said, Kai quickly grabs her coat and backpack that she has already packed for days that she spends the night at Aunt September's house, with her stuff she heads out the front door of her house. running at fast speed she finds her aunts house, that's 3 blocks away from her house. when she reaches the front porch she bands on the wooden door. *knock, knock, knock* (no answer)
*bang, bang, bang* (no answer)
"Aunt September!!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!!!"
Kai quickly looks around the house for a light, shadow, anything. Then finally she circles back around the house where she has started. "What do you want me to know!" Kai days frustrated, then she finds a crumbled up peace of paper giving instructions.
to my dearest Kai,
I'm sorry that you had to go through that it wasn't your fault. Now listen there is a ticket to the next plane ride to California. Yes, I know what you're thinking but you won't be safe here in Abaline especially with all that's going on so i know you will have a safe flight and further instructions are on the back of this page.  hugs and kisses, Aunt September

After Kai read the letter she busted into tears. "If that's what it takes then so be it." and wiped get tears
And after that Kai packed her bags and walked to the airport, but the airport is only 1 mile from her house so she was fine.  After she made it to the airport she borded the plane. "Now it's time for me to me to start my new journey." Kai said feeling better
