So with in only basically 2 minutes of postingÂ  the last chapter, somepony got out. And I think most of you will like the the person who won! First things first, this was a really fun category to do. It also went by pretty fast. Anyway here are the results.

6: SILVER SHILL
5: SEABREEZE
4: SPITFIRE
3: COCO POMMEL
2: DISCORD
1: CHEESE SANDWICH
Great job Cheese! I'm so glad that Cheese won. Especially since Cheese is my Oc's brother I am really glad that he won. Anyway the next category is one mane 6 girl-x-boy ships. So yeah, that one will probably have a lot of nominees. Anyway that's all for this chapter. Keep calm and be a band geek. Flute_player_1 out!
