After we done talking about things, we decided we should go back to the dorms. We got all our things and hopped back into Gavin's car and drove back.
Once we arrived, I kissed him goodbye and said thanks for today. "No problem." He whispered. I walked back to my dorm and saw Sam and Shelby. "Hey guys!" I said. "Hey! Where've you been?" Shelby asked. "Oh, I was with Gavin at the beach house." I responded. "Ooohh," Sam said. "Shut up, Sam." I said jokingly. After cuddling and watching videos together, Sam left and Shelby began to scream. "I'm so in love!" She said, sighing. I laughed. "Yeah, me too." We both took showers and talked about what had happened today. "Ah, well we better get some sleep, school tomorrow!" Shelby said, finally laying down and not sitting up in her bed. "Okay, goodnight! Love you honey buns!" I said before turning off my lamp. "Night and love you too!" Shelby replied. I plugged my headphones in and turned on my music and fell asleep to OneRepublic.
I dreamt about Gavin and his rosy cheeks with his wavy brown hair and hazel eyes.  I'm so happy to call him mine.
