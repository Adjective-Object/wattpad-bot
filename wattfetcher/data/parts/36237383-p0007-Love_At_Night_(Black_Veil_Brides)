I moved closer to him on the bed. Andy made me feel different. Little did he understand my burden but he himself had his own. Andy looked down at his hands before he spoke.
"Why didn't you kill me last night. Its been on my mind and I just need to know." He asked.
"I dont know. There was just something about you." Once I said this he tilted his head to the side a little. He Sat up and moved closer and settled his hand gently on my chest where myÂ  heart should be.
"Interesting." Andy closes his eyes and focuses and smiles.
"It seems you have feelings for me" He spoke clearly. I had no words to explain it but I couldnt deny the truth. He softly kissed my cheek and held your hand. I felt the warmth radiating from him.
"No theres someone else.... the vampire last night. I dont know if he loves me." I say frantically. I remember what Ashley said about his fights and I wouldnt doubt he wouldnt back down.
"Your heart tells me you also have feelings for me." He looked at me.
"What does your heart say Andy?" I look back and smile softly.
"Its open for you Kat."
