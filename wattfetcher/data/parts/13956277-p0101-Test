"Really bad things happen here, you have no idea, we are kidnapped, half of those girls aren't Americans,  they are daughters of some tourists, some organisation kidnapped us from our parents" Nina's sister sobbed, "I can help, tell me", "I'll show you, follow me" She pulled my hand and we went to the basement, "Don't freak out" She turned the light on and I gasped, "What are those things?" My eyes were about to pop out of my head, I saw a chair and chains with some wooden pieces beside, "Torture room, for those who don't do what they are supposed to do", "A - and what are you supposed to do?" I was afraid of the answer, "It depends on what they want, every few days some people come and choose the girls they want, they buy or rent them for few days, some of the girls become maids, others babysit and others become slaves and do things you'll never excpect" Tears were rolling down her cheeks, "Why didn't any of you run away?" I wiped her tears, "Where can we go ? Who can we call ? What can we do? Those who try get punished, and this *points at the blue cheek* is my punishment for giving you a hint, heard me the last time you came" How could they do this to them ! "I'm going to get you out of here", "No, they'll find us and kill us", "They won't, and even if they do, death is better than living here", "It's not as easy as you think, many people are involved in this, this is not the only orphanage, this is huge... you know what? I do 2 times what other girls do just to protect Nina and let her stay here" I stood in my place totally frozen, "Call the police", "They already know, can you believe that every week they come and pick a girl" She giggled sarcastically, "This is bigger than I thought, "We don't get to get food because half of the time our hands are too sore to hold a spoon" She kept telling me about the awful things that was happening, "She's back, you better get out before she sees you" Nina came running toward me and her sister, "Hurry up Leena" They leaded me to the back door, "I'll do something, I promise" I got out and went to get my car but I saw the ugly woman standing beside Simon and talking, I called Simon : "I'm out, get rid of her" I hung up and I saw Simon waving at her then he got into his car and she got into the orphanage, I ran to my car quickly and turned it on, Simon kept following me with his car while beeping, I collapsed and stopped on the side of the road, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU ! I KEPT B- are you crying?" He lifted my chin up, "No, I'm washing my eyes, idiot" I heard him chuckle, then he got into the seat beside mine, "What went wrong?", "Everything" I sobbed, "Please don't cry", "هل تصدق انه في هذه الدنيا يوجد أشخاص بأرواح شياطين ؟", "What did you say? Was this Arabic? " He asked, "Sorry, forgot that, I said: Can you believe that in this world there are people with souls of devils ?" I continued crying as flashbacks hit me, The look of the girls, how badly hurt they were, how hungry and bruised they appeared, "I do, I believe in devils behind masks of humans" I kept crying, "Get down, come on" Simon opened the door for me, "Where ?" I sniffed, "You can't drive like this, let's get a cup of coffee to calm you down then I'll get you back to your car" Simon opened the door of his car and I hopped in, I knew it wasn't appropriate but my emotions and mind were a total mess.
I sipped some coffee as I was telling Simon everything I knew about this fake orphanage, "A - and the worst the - thing is-" And I started crying again, Simon stood up and left me, "Great, now he left too" I sniffed again then saw Simon sitting across me and put a chocolate cake in front of me, "This will make you feel better" a smile crossed my face, "You have to forget about it", "forget about what?", "The orphanage and what goes inside it, it's dangerous, don't put yourself in troubles we won't be able to get you out of", "I can't just simply continue my life normally after what I've known, I can't just wake up happily anymore while knowing that there are some girls who didn't sleep at all because of the pain that was kicking in them, how could you be careless? Many people don't care, don't need more of those, you can just walk out the door and I will understand, because after all, It's not your problem and I got you involved in it, you are rich and drive a fancy car, you don't know what it feels to have nothing, but I do, I wasn't born rich, in my childhood all I could play with was sand and mud, the only toy I had was the one made by my mother. I didn't eat cereal or blueberry, and sometimes there wasn't bread for breakfast, all that was because my father didn't want to steal, to kidnap, to lie or to take money that isn't his, he got kicked out of 5 jobs then he started his own company, I know what being cold feels, I know how much it hurts to see your parents suffering, and I bet it hurts more to never see them. So at the end of this conversation, I don't expect you to hold my hand and encourage me, I don't expect you to tell me that you'll stick to the end, neither to give me ideas to save the girls. All I want from you is to keep this a secret and I won't even mind if you push the door and leave at this moment" Simon was speechless with his eyes wide open, "I-I didn't know what you've been through, I'm sorry", "It's Okay, Alhamdulillah,  this is what got me stronger, and a- is that a tear tangling from your lower eyelid?" I moved closer to him, he seemed so touched, "No! Come on ! Men don't cry" He laughed out loud and wiped his eyes quickly, "What were you doing with the ugly woman in front of the orphanage?" I raised an eyebrow "Is that jealousy?" He teased, "Oh please?  Seriously ? I just noticed some feelings running around both of you" I teased back, "NO WAY ! I was just standing outside watching then she came and I spoke to her to keep her out long enough for you to escape, she flirted with me, a 40 years old woman flirted me, Eww" I laughed at his expressions, "Let's go home" I stood up, "I wont be able to sleep well before each girl sleeps in her parent's house, I got your back" He said then hugged me, I hugged back really tight, I needed his hug more than anything at that moment, "What ! No! move" I pushed him away when I realized what was going on, I was making mistakes, "We should keep space" I ran out the coffee shop, "Leena ! Wait", "Please Simon, don't get too close because then both of us will get hurt, I don't want to attach you with invisible imaginary ropes then let you fall", "Leena just-", "NO, JUST LEAVE ! I DONT NEED MORE COMPLICATIONS" I turned around and started running away but, Simon followed me and caught my shoulders and spun me around, "LISTEN TO ME ! DONT RUN AWAY LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED ! You don't just simply walk away after getting me attached", "I know what you got in mind, I understand why you've been so nice to me, but it will never happen, just like how the stars and sun won't appear at the same time", "No! I'LL MAKE IT WORK, I WILL FIND AWAY ! BECAUSE I LIKE YOU ... and nobody in this world made me get a mix of feelings like you did, I didn't think that it was possible to feel happy and angry at the same time, getting annoyed but enjoying it, getting burnt but still like who burnt me. You, Leena, YOU changed all my theories", "Just leave before it gets worse" I tried to escape from his grips, "Too late, I have already fallen and I'm not planning to get up" My brain couldn't handle all the actions that I've been through that day, but I was awake enough to take decisions and not make any more  mistakes because I have already done some, starting from the day I came here and let some of my rules fade "The best thing I can offer is friendship, a friendship where I can only say 'Hi' to you from a distance between 3-4 feet".
