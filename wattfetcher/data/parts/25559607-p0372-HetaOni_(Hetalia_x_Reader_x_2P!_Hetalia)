Giving the American a confused look, England asked, "What?"


"That's why I won't accept it. Even though you were defeated, you saved me and in the end you died... I'm the hero. It's up to me... I'd rather be the one doing the saving. I'll prove it to you. This time I'll save you guys." America told them, clenching his fists.


With a loud thud, a humongous alien-like monster drops down into the study, slowly walking towards them.


"Aaagh!!" Italy shouted.


England back away against the right wall and America walks up to the monster.

America pushed England away from the monsters path and pointed a gun at the creature.


Rubbing his head, England creased his forehead. "Ow! Hey, America! You-"


America shot the monster using his gun a couple of times, but...


"I-It didn't work?!" America exclaimed, horrified at what was happening.



The large creature charges towards America.



England stood up and yelled. Â "Watch out!! What the hell are you doing, you idiot?!"


All the blood seemed to drain from America's face. "SHI-"



"AMERICA!!" Italy called out frantically.
