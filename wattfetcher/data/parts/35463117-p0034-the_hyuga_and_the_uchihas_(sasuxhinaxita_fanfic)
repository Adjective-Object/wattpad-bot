Me: sorry I only sang in chorus. And that ended due to it being the end of the school year and all.
Hatsuharu sohma: I'm actually quite curious as to how you sound.
Tohru: oh please, do sing writer.
Kyo: *just heard I might sing* wait you can sing?
Me: kinda. A few of my kitties say I sound and I'll quote, "beautiful".
Kyo: I wanna hear it. Just human curiosity so long as that damn momiji shuts up.
Momiji: waaaaaaaaaaa! Kyo you're mean!
Kisa sohma: *hugs tohru* sissy!
Me: do I have to sing?
Shigure sohma: oh please do! I want to know what you sound like!
Ayame sohma: oh please do sing! I'd like to know if you're as good as I was!
Yuki: why are you hear!?
Ayame: well I heard there was people here and decided to join in the fun!
Me: you guys really want to hear me sing?
Everyone except kyo: yes!
Kyo: sure. I guess.
Me: okay then. But this song's called "lullaby"
*I'm too lazy to write the whole thing so just look up "wolfs rain- lullaby" and click the vid with the two different colored eyes and you should be good. Idk*
Kyo: ya sound cool.
Momiji: that was amazing
Me: thanks zodiac lovlies! And tohru and kyo of course.
Kyo: hey! I will be a part of the zodiac!
Akito sohma: a cat will never be part of the zodiac.
Me: don't be mean to the carrot top you sexy jerkwad!
Everyone except akito: huh?
Me: you heard.
Akito: don't ever call me that again you hear?!
Me: fine handsome hothead.
Akito: *slaps me across face* I said not to call me that!
Me: oi! That hurt you hot-as-fuck bitch!
Akito: *goes to slap me again but hitori and shigure and Yuki stop him* don't provoke me!
Nkay I have writers block again. Bye bye kittens!)
