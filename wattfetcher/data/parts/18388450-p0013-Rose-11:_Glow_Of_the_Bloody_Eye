Hey guys, I am sorry I haven't been uploading since forever so here's chapter 9.
______________      It was there, just a few feet away. Looking like it will swallow me into enternal darkness. The sight scared me. I was shivering uncontrollably. Feeling the hairs at the back of my back stand. I never felt like this before. That feeling feels similar, like it was not in my brain, it was there deep down in my heart. And I knew what it was. I recognize it now.
It's fear.     The adrenaline rushed through my body and the next thing I knew, I was running. Running like my life depended on it. I heard them shouting my name but there just the background of my rapidly beating heart.
I ran to the dorms and into my room and locked the door.
I was still shivering.
I crawled to my bed and laid there hugging my knees closer to my chest.
I closed my eyes and tried to forget the gun but it just got worse.
"It will be okay, Rose" I heard Roby say from behind the room.
"Let me be, Roby." I whispered. I heard him sighed, a sign that he heard me. I opened my eyes and stretched myself so that my back was on the matteress. I looked up at the ceiling, staring at nothing.
"Is that what I wanted?"_______________________
I wake up the next morning by the alarm clock. It was 6:00 am. I was still wearing last night's clothes. I don't get how I slept that long while I dosed off for ten years.
I got out and had a shower. After I got out I wore a black shirt and jeans with brown combact boots. I left my bag at the training room and now I will have to go back and getting it.
I got out and started making my towards the training room. I wasn't in the mood for breakfast.
When I got there, I found Mr.Arnold sitting in the glass room on the couch looking at some papers my bag was right beside him. I gulped nervously and walked inside.
"I came to get my bag." I said sternly.
"I noticed." He replied. "But you are not leaving easily."
"What?"
"I took permission from Dr.Ali to train you today since you missed out on yesterday and he agreed." He finally looked up from the papers and looked at me.
I was breathing unstably from under my mouth. I couldn't do that. I couldn't even stand the sight of the gun, how am I going to shoot with it?
"Sit." He said. I opligated him and sat down on the in front of him. I looked down not wanting to meet his gaze.
"The reason why you are here is not just to kill, it's to protect." He said sternly. "You wouldn't have been here in front of me if it was just to kill vampires."
"Then what is it?" I ask confusingly.
"Rose, you do realize you are a half-blooded vampire. You already a a bomb walking on the surface of this earth. But we could have got rid of you but we didn't."
"Why?"
"Our enemies are starting to get stronger throughout these couple of years. There was a mess between the generals and the main heads about keeping you alive. When we were on the verge of deciding to kill you, you woke up. There's no going back now."
