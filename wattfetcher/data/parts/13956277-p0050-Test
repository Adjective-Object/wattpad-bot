"I'll make some popcorn" I said.
"Will you put poison in it" William asked.
"Please don't provoke me, I'm not good when I get angry" I gave him a fake smile.
"The good Muslim girl is getting angry I'm scared" William teased.
"Shut up William" Simon said.
"Why are you putting this thing over your head" He put his and on my hijab trying to take it off.
So I punched his face and kicked his knee.
"OUCH" William shouted in pain while was twisting on the ground holding his bleeding nose.
"What happened !!!!" Hannah asked and ran to William "Are you okay ?" She asked him in worry.
"I punched him" I said proudly.
"Why ? what's wrong with you" Hannah glared at me.
"Well sorry, I warned him" I shrugged my shoulders.
"She wasn't gonna hit him if he didn't provoke her" Peter.
"What did he do" Tom asked.
"He tried to take off the thing on her head" Simon said.
"He deserves that" Damon said.
"Can you please help me" William begged, Simon and Tom helped him to get up.
"Just give him some tissues and put some ice on his knee" I said and put the popcorn in the microwave.
They took William to the living room to take care of him, Tom came to the kitchen "He's my friend butÂ honestly, good punch" He chuckled.
"Black belt in Karate, black belt" I giggled.
"Owwh, I better back off then" He laughed and I did too.
"The popcorn is ready" I put it in a bowl and went to the living room.
I put the bowl on the table and saw everyone in a comfortable position.
I searched for a comfortable lonely spot to sit in, away from the boys, So I sat on the floor.
"Sit on the couch, it's big enough for all of us" Jake said.
"No thanks, I'm good here" I kept my eyes on the screen.
"Turn the light off" Molly said, Simon stood up and turned it off.
I saw the girls twitching from the corner of my eyes.
A scary sense came "DON'T GO AAAAAAHHHH" They all screamed.
I turned my face at them "You are such chickens" I put my hand in the popcorn bowl to take some, but I changed my mind and took the whole bowl.
"Hey" William pulled it back.
"I'm already pissed off so give it back to me if you don't want to bleed again" I threatened.
"Okay" He gave it back.
"where's Elina ?" I didn't find her so I looked at Damon.
"ELINA AND LEWIS" Damon shouted.
"Oh hey I'm here" They jumped out of nowhere.
"Where have you been ?" Damon asked them.
"We uh- drinking water" Lewis said.
"Just let it go man" William said.
