I'm pacing my room. Lugnut and Tanner are watching me. "Ugh!  I'm scared to ask her to marry me."  I tell them while I flop on my bed.     "Calm down, it'll be fine Butchy." Lugnut says. "You sure?" I ask them. "Positive." Tanner says. "Anyways, Giggles loves you and you love her. No need to be scared." Tanner says. "Thanks guys. I think I'll ask her tonight. I just need a ring." I said.                                           ~TIME SKIP~
Tanner runs up to me in the ring store and drags me to the shelf full of sparkleling rings. "How's this?" Lugnut asks me, its a silver ring with a small dimond in the middle. "Perfect for Giggles." I say. We buy it and head back home.
