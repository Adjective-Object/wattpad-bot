I am losing. Such a stupid little boy. I thought I was stronger but clearlyI am wrong. This is what I asked for isn't it?So I deserve what will happen. Watch me chicken out of my own death. That'd be hilarious.
My friends will soon be gone. After all, I only have one left.
But leaving will harm him. I of all people should know how suicide affects lives.
But I have lost reason to carry on.
Weak. Foolish. Incompetent.
I am all of those and more.
But who would listen to the boy who will be buried in a dress.
No one.
Not a single damn person.
What a fuck up. I am a fuck up.
Good job.
