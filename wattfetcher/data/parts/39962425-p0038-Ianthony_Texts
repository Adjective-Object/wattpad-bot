I: Anthony Padilla!
A: Yeah?
I: Don't you 'yeah' me! You know what you fucking did!
A: ...... What?
I: Don't 'what' me! You know all fucking well what you did!
A: I-I don't know what you're talking about! Why are you so mad at me?
I: I'm not mad. I'm fucking dissapointed.
A: What did I do?!
I: You know what you did. You're going to be sleeping on the couch tonight, no kisses, hugs, cuddles, or any physical contact till you apologize and mean it!
A: fine....
A: I love you <3
I: Bye Anthony.
