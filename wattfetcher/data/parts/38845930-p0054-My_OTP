Jordan's POV
I hung out in my bedroom for a while when Erin was in the shower, I ended up falling asleep from last nights excitement and lack of sleep from Erin saying we could move in together.
Erin's POV
"Jordan?" I asked only wearing a towel, he was asleep so I desided to get dressed.
"Erin?" He asked after I threw my towel onto the floor next to the bed.
I screamed and he screamed.
"Oh my god, I'm so sorry." He said into the pillow he was holding to his face.
"It's fine, it's okay. Umm, oh my god." I said as I was putting on a shirt.
"Oh my god!" He screamed.
"You can look." I said after I got fully dressed.
"Oh my god!" He screamed again.
"You can look now." I said climbing into his bed.
"Oh my god." He said.
"Jordan!" I said annoyed at his "oh my god"'s.
"I'm so sorry." He said
Jordan's POV --sorry Erin's POV was so short, I wanted to tell that from her point of view so you it could be told better and more detailed--
"Jordan, it's fine. It's not like I don't know you." She said.
"Oi." I said.
"Hey!"
"What!?" I asked throwing the pillow from my face.
"It's not like you might never see it again." She said.
"What the hell!? I asked.
"Well, that's a... way to start the morning for you." She said.
"It's a what way to start the morning?" I asked.
"I don't know, good for you?" She said.
"Good!? It was embarrassing for even me! Are you not embarrassed?" I asked.
"Probably not as much as you, your cheeks are so red." She said swinging her legs over mine.
"How are you not embarrassed?" I asked.
"Oh I am very embarrassed, I'm just not showing it." She said.
"I just saw you completely naked -- I should stop talking now." I said.
"It's fine. What, did you hate it?" She asked.
"You're not serious, I'm not answering that." I said covering my entire body with the covers.
"So you did like it?" She asked
"Ahh!" I screamed.
"Hi, Jordan." She said as she got under the covers with me. I turned away from her and covered my face with a pillow only to scream into it and try and forget what I just saw.
"Oh my god!" I screamed.
"Jesus, how embarrassed can someone get?" She asked.
"I don't know!" I yelled.
"Please stop, I'm the one who should be embarrassed." She said putting her arm around me.
"Well, I guess it could happen again." I said.
"What?" She asked.
"We're going to live together." I said.
