I don't understand how my mind works sometimes. It's almost scary. If I let my thoughts wander they hurt me. I am their cage but they make my mind hell. I can't ever tell exactly what I'm thinking or how I'll feel today. Yet my wishes stay the same. I want to die but I'm scared of the after. Maybe that's what's keeping me here. Maybe it isn't the coaxing from my friends or the conversations with Jordan. Perhaps it is just fear. Fear controls. But it's funny because I'm not even really alive. How is it that the only emotion I can constantly feel is fear. It is controlling me. I will never truly live due to the fear that controls me. And I'm getting used to it. I enjoy not living. Just. Existing. I can exist and just make it seem like all is well and then others stop worrying. I'm beginning to like my fear. It's something I can call my own. A genuine emotion. It is mine. I'm glad my fear controls me. Maybe one day I will be too scared to live. So scared that I won't worry about what comes after. And then I'll do it. Although I'm sure it will happen before then.
Some people think I want to die because I want to hurt others. Do you realize how funny that sounds when you say it like that. What good would it do me to ruin people's lives by ending my own?Nothing.
Death is the only salvation.
So Dear me, I'm sorry you were born. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I didn't love you. I'm sorry I put you down. I'm sorry I made your life miserable. I'm sorry I made everything hell for you. I'm sorry.
I'm beginning to see why I deserve the cards I was dealt.
