Look guys, I colored it.
OMG I CAN COLOR.
I MAY REGRET MANY THINGS ABOUT THE STUFF I DRAW. Like when I shipped Skye x Arrow. (Skrow) THAT, WAS A BIG NO NO. Let's just keep the ship Skye x Steve. (Skeve) Also, that face doe is because I'm hearing Chica and Bonnie arguing in the vents again to move over. Foxy and Freddy are playing true or dare in the bathroom again too. *grabs meh flashlight and goes down the hallway toward the bathroom* Frick Frack. Freddy? Foxy? (Just realized that's a lotta 'F's xD) *Foxy jump scares me* SHEAAAAAAAAATTTTTT.
