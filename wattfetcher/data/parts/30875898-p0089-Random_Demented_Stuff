It might look like words don't hurt me
But they really leave scars on my soul
And when you see the damage, this simpithy fucking old
Go ahead, call me an attention whore
While I'm alone, bleeding all over the floor
Oh, you wanna call me emo scum
I don't fucking care
But make fun of our scars, I swear, don't you even dare
What, go ahead and say it, you think I'm a slut
Well, why don't you just keep your  fucking mouth shut
Yeah, fucking say to my face
Words don't hurt me anyway
All they ever did was, leave scars on me for eternity
