"You're the best." Taylor said, "I already know." I said he laughed and I giggled. "You should sing." Cameron suggested and everyone nodded I shrugged. "I don't know." I said Cameron started to stare me down like he always did. I walked in the kitchen only to see him again.
I quickly walk out and he stares at me, I went to the bathroom and after I washed my hands, I walked out. I screamed falling to the floor again to see Cameron standing next to the door way.
The guys look back at me and I start to laugh again. I walk to sit next to Hayes and kiss him, I crawled on his lap and Cameron was still staring. "Okay okay I will j-just please stop staring." I pulled away talking to Cameron.
"Yay!" He clapped his hands, he went to get my guitar, "Oh his size, oh how I love his size. Oh his smile, oh how I want his smile. His hair, so voluptuous, I just-want him no-ow cause he's."
"Cameron Dallas, he is my boyfriend, oh I love him so, you can't have him, because he's all mine oh, Cameron Dallas, is my boyfriend, and I love him soo Cameron Dallas." I sung I chuckle.
"Why would I sing that?" I asked myself, "If anything I should be Hayes Grier is my boyfriend." Nash said I blushed and Hayes kissed my cheek then nibbled on my ear I start to squeal, and smile.
"Goals." Cameron said, "Oh I know what song." I said. I started to strum and started to sing, "When tomorrow comes I'll be on my own feeling frightened of the things that I don't know when tomorrow comes tomorrow comestomorrow comes." I glance at Cameron.
"And though the road is long,I look up to the sky, and in the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly and I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along." I start to remember Riley.
"I got all I need when I got you and I, I look around me, and see sweet life, I'm stuck in the, dark but you're my flashlight, you're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes. I can't lie, it's a sweet life I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight you're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night cause you're my flash light you're my flash light, you're my flash light." I close my eyes.

"I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight you're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night cause you're my flash light you're my flash light, you're my flash light you're my flash light light light you're my flash light light lightyou're my flashlight." I finish the song then glance at Hayes, "And this song is dedicated to the one and only the love of my life." I said smiling.
"Aww!" Cameron said "I hope you know I mean pizza right?" I ask him he chuckled, "I'm kidding, I love Hayes more." I said, He kisses me and I hold on to the back of his neck. "Okay." Cameron said, "Nash why do you look like you're about to cry?" I asked him, "Your song." he said I chuckled standing up to hug him.
Hayes looks a little jealous so I give him a 'be nice' look he gives me a fake smile and I let go of Nash. I walk back over to Hayes, he faces the other way, I roll my eyes grabbing my guitar and putting it back and sitting down back in my spot next to Hayes.
I turn back to Nash who throw a pillow at me, "What's wrong with him?" He asked, I held up my finger as a 'hold on' I text him that he was jealous.

Nash throws another pillow at me, "I'm scared." I mouthed to him, "Just go for it." he mouthed back I nodded, I stand up crawling over Hayes smashing my lips on his he looks shocked and kisses back.
