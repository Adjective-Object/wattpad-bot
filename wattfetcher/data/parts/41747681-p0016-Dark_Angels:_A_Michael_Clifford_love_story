Rolling her eyes, Julie bends down and retrieves the torn up picture. When she holds the two pieces side by side, a devilish smile appears. "You never told me you had a boyfriend."
"He wasn't my boyfriend," Lacey spits harshly. "And I'm not telling you anything about him so don't even ask."
Julie shrugs. "Well alright. It's a shame though. He's a cutie pie."
"WHAT DID YOU SAY?" Lacey bursts out laughing and slams her hand against the wall. "Michael was hideous. Probably still is."
Julie strides over to her bed and takes a seat, crossing her arms and eyeing her friend. "So, his name's Michael?"
Lacey face palms. "Fuck."
"It suits him, I think." Julie chuckles, knowing Lacey was agitated at the fact that she spilled some information she didn't want to be known. "So who is he?"
"A dickhead," Lacey curses. "An inconsiderate, irrelevant dickhead."
"And why..."
"I'm not talking about it!" Lacey screeches, her chest rising and falling. "Just...leave it alone...please."
Julie crosses her legs Indian style. "You'll have to talk about it someday." She whispers.
"Yeah well," Lacey murmurs, balling her fist. "Today's not the day."
