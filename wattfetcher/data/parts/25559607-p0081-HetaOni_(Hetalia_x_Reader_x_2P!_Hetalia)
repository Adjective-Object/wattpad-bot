They all ran back to warn the others.
-----------
The first person they ran into was the tall Russian.
"Oh, you're back. What's the matter?" he asked, tilting his head to the side.
"We can't use that exit! It's been burnt out! We have to run now!" Japan told him.
Russia nodded. "I see. Good thing you found me. Let's hurry. The others should be back soon now."

"Oh, so we can't use it any more? Too bad. Let's just get away now." France said as they met up with him in the next room.
---
When they found China in the room after that, they informed him, "It won't open. Let's find some other door!"
China raised his eyebrow. "Really?! Let's hurry!"
---
"I-I see. That's too bad. Anyway, let's hurry.America and England are in that room over there." Canada said, pointing to the door ahead of them.
---
"You can't be serious! Just when we thought we were finally going to get out..." England said sullenly.
"Lock the door!!" ______ told Japan, who was the last one to enter the room.
"Oh!" Japan let out as he turned to lock the door.
"Wow. So, now we're all assembled in this tiny room." America said, crossing his arms.
"(Thank God... thank God!! Oh, dear... For a moment there, I really feared we weren't going to make it.)" Japan thought.
"Damn it! Even though we're all together here, our situation hasn't got any better!
Now we're locked up in here and that fucking monster is after our asses!" Germany said bitterly.
"West, don't be so pessimistic. What matters is that we're alive. Besides, with so many nations gone, maybe someone will come to rescue us." Prussia told his younger brother.
Japan suddenly felt uneasy. "(... How odd. I... I feel as though I'm forgetting something important...)"
_____ started whispering something. "Ja..Japan..."
When he turned to face her, the girl suddenly falls to her knees.
"_____-chan?! What's..." Japan exclaimed.
"_____? It's...It's alright...We'll just find another way out of here. D-Don't..worry, love..." England said as he kneeled down with the girl, thinking she needs some comforting.
France walked over to the two. "Oh my... These tears do not suit you, mademoiselle.. Please stop crying.."
_____ shakes her head.
"Japan...you must..remember..." ______ choked out the words.
Japan furrowed his eyebrows. "Remember?"
While they were tending to the young girl, the others discussed what to do next.
"--Besides, we still need to connect the time we spend here with the time in the outside world. We have to keep breaking the clocks." China suggested.
Russia nodded. "Yeah, that's the best short-cut. Except we'll need our strength somehow...
