Chapter 1
Shea's P.O.V
"Shea! Can you come down here please!? There are people here I want you to meet!" I groaned loudly and got up of my comfortable bed.
I walked over towards my bedroom door and stubbed my freaking tow on the door. "FUCK!" I screamed and covered my mouth quickly. I composed myself and held back the tears that where trying to escape. I'm not going to cry.
I made my way downstairs and stopped dead in my tracks. Seth Morbin was in my living room.
"What are you doing here?" I asked him suddenly.
"Its non of your buisness actually" He spat back.
"Actually it is! This is my house!" I said raising my voice.
"Well it looks like it won't be soon!" He said back.
'What do you mean?" I asked confused.
"My dad brought me here to meet his new girlfriend, which is suposedly moving in with us! I had no idea she had a daughter!" He yelled.
"Seth" A man that looked almost exact to seth but taller, more muscular, and no peircings came into veiw along with my mother. I looked at her confused and she just shrugged. "Hello you must me Shea. I'm Brad. I am dating your mother. It seems she just informed me you didn't know about this?" He asked questionably.
"Uh no I did not." I could feel tears forming in my eyes but I held them in. I was not about to cry infron of these people. I have never cried infront of anybody. "I need a minute" I ran from them and back upstairs. I slammed my door hard and crawled onto my bed. How couls she do this? She said she loved Dad. Was she waiting for him to die so she could go find some other man? Its only been 2 years! Its still such a sensitive topic for me. I watch my father die! I wantched the life drain from his body! What did my mother do? She never visited! She never wanted to talk about him! She wouldn't even take me to the cemetary to see him. That gives me an idea.
I threw on my shoes and grabbed my purse and car keys. I made my way downstairs and I saw my mom on the couch crying and Brad comforting her. Seth looked absolutely bored.
"Mom i'm going out" I said looking over at her.
"Where?" She asked.
'Its non of your buisness" I spat at her.
'I'm coming!" Seth said
"I don't know if you would want to" I said looking over at him.
"Anything to get out of here" He said standing up.
"I guess we will be back in an hour or 2" I said walking out the door. Seth followed close behind me and followed me to my car. I got in and so did he.
"So where are we going?" He asked buckeling up
"To see my dad" I said with a blank expression.
"Oh uhm I don't do good with fathers" He said worridly
"Don't worry he can't do anything to you" I said with a smug smile.
"Why not?"
'Hes dead" I replied flatly.
"Oh, uhm so-"
"Don't. I don't need your pity" I said pulling out of the driveway.
After about 30 minutes we made it to the cemetary my father was burried at. I pulled up to the side of the road next to his stone and got out.
