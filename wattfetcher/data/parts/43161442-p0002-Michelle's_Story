"What's going on?" Eli asked me. He seemed to not trust that I was saving our asses from certain death, but whatever.
"We're gonna get outta here. 3...2...1!" I said quietly. Just then a man came in the room. He was wearing a guard uniform, but I could tell who he was. He pulled the lever, releasing us, and we bolted. Running to get our mecha-beasts and slugs. I hopped on my wolf mecha, and sped through the citadel, the Shane Gang right behind me. Doc shot a Frostcrawler and made a temporary ramp to a window. We ran up it and there was broken glass flying everywhere. I got a few cuts, but nothing major. We're home free I thought. I was wrong. So very wrong. Dr. Blakk was waiting for us. With his blaster loaded. However, he wasn't aiming at the Shane Gang...he was aiming for me. He shot, and time seemed to slow down. I got hit with a Thesher, in the stomach. Blood, my blood, spilled all over my mecha. Thankfully the Tharasher didn't kill me, but I was in so much pain. When time seemed to return to normal, my mecha was no longer moving, neither was Doc's or any of the Shane Gang's. The Molenoid said something, but I was loosing consciousness, so I couldn't make it out. Darkness was trying to crawl it's way into my vision, but I fought back. There was no way I was dying here, in front of Blakk. I would not give him the satisfaction. Then, I blacked out.
