This is a rigby x reader fanfic. I am writing this story because there are NONE whatsoever and that pisses me off! So I'm gonna show some love for the rig-bone and write him his own story. I just want to explain a few things before we begin: 1. I do NOT own any of the regular show characters 2. Some of the characters will be humans like rigby Mordecai Margaret and others (please don't be mad at me! )3. You will be half fox half human like that girl in da picture 4.I am in LOVE with music soo there will be a lot of parts with music in them like dis one! Dances to the song
Aaaaannnddd I think that's it OK have fun being with rigby~â™¥ Lol I hope to see you guys soon my little hana's (that's Japanese for flowers in case you were confused ) -red_madame
