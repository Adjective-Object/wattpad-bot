**Kian's POV**"Kian dare or extreme dare" Jc asked "Extreme dare" I said. it a Monday night and we are really bored Sam and Jc we were whispering in each other's ears and laughed "Ok Kian we dare you to adopt a baby" my face went blank "I can't adopt a child I'm only 19" I can't be a dad, no way. "Come on dude it will save a kid's life. You have to it's a dare" I was thinking till I got interrupted "So what you gonna say" Jc said waving his hand in my face "Well. Ummm. Alright then, but we are getting a boy I can't deal with girl problems." They nodded as I got up to go to bed. It was 3PM.
**The Next Day**
I woke up and remembered one very important thing. I'm going to have to adopt a little boy.
I took shower then put on a blue tank, navy skinny jeans, blue vans and a SnapBack. I had pancakes, and went on my MacBook to search up a local orphanage.
I finally found one and it had online profiles of them. Only one caught my eye.
Name: Vincent Isaac Murphy
DOB: 6 February
Age: 2
Nickname: Vinnie or Vin
Likes: Eating, Sleeping, Cookies, Disney, Space
Dislikes: Loud Noises
Cause of being there: Parents Were To Young To Look After Him

I emailed the orphanage and asked if I could pick him up tomorrow and they said that's fine. I called Jc and Sam down (they stayed round his house) "Sam, Jc I chose a child to adopt. We need to design a room come on" they came running Down the stairs into the car.
We got loads of stuff, we gotSippy Cups PacifiersClothes, Socks, Tops, Shorts, SnapBack, ectRed Car Seat Green StrollerBlue High ChairDresserBedSpace SheetsToys
Once we were done we got Taco Bell and went home. We got the room ready within about 3, 4 hours (pic to side). By now the time was 6pm so I decided to email the orphanage to go get him now. They replied with a yeah that's fine I will go pack his stuff see you soon. "Sam, Jc wanna come get Vinnie with me" they answered "Yeah ok".
Sam pressed the doorbell, a middle aged woman opened the door "Hello you must be Kian Lawley. Come in come in" we walked in and I saw a teenage boy holding little Vinnie making funny faces. "James dear could you say goodbye to Vinnie please" Heather (the orphanage owner) said. I walked off with Heather to sign the papers leaving Vinnie with Sam, Jc stayed in the car. I signed the last bit then I thanked Heather and strapped Vinnie in his car seat. "You my daddy?" He asked tilting his head and pointing to me "Yes I'm your daddy" I smiled.
When we got home Vinnie was asleep so I put him in his crib and sat in the hallway and just thought, I am a daddy now. A teenage daddy.
