Snow: I found a solution to our little dark one dilemma.
Charming : What?
Snow: The author! Henry is the author now he can just write the darkness into oblivion!
TruestBeliever : About that...
Charming: That's a great idea!
TruestBeliever : I can't actually do that.
Snow: What do you mean?
TruestBeliever : Well you see when we got back from the magical alternate universe I was speaking with the apprentice about the pen. It was to much power so I broke it...
Snow:YOU DID WHAT?!?
YourMajesty : I'm proud of you Henry. Not many people can pass up that amount of power.
Charming: Regina do you know what this means?
YourMajesty : That our lives won't be stories anymore.
Snow: Why are you so calm about this?
YourMajesty: Because I got my happy ending.
WickedGreen: You may have gotten your happy ending but I'm pregnant with his child :P
YourMajesty : Shut up Zelena nobody asked you. How did you even get a phone?
WickedGreen: That's beside the point.
YourMajesty : Ugh! Why do you want to ruin everything? I didn't do anything to you. If you are going to be mad at anyone you should be mad at mother.
QueenOfHearts : HEY! Leave me out of this!
Snow: Okay break it up ladies Now is not the time to be making each other angry! We should be saving my daughter!
YourMajesty : Not everything's about you! Other people have problems to!
