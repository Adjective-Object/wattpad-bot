Wow this girl can eat. I stopped by McDonald's and grabbed everything she wanted to eat. While i was there i grabbed something for myself too. When i got home this morning my mom was asking me questions like why i wasn't in school today and whatever but she wasn't mad though, she told me not to let it happen again. I walked out the restraunt with the bags of food and went for my car. As i was walking i saw this cute girl smiled at me then i smiled back. She came towards me and we started talking then she gave me her phone number. Don't think I'm cheating on Chelsea, i just got her number for friend related conversations or hangouts. I got in and went straight for chelseas.
As I pull up to her driveway I grabbed everything out the car and closed the door.  I knocked on the door and here opens a hungry girl awaiting for he food. "Oh chres I'm so glad you here gimme food.....please" I chuckled and she took them and sat in the living room. I grabbed my food and started eating. I watched as she chomped down her food. Just then I got a text from the girl at mcdonalds (her name is Brianna btw)
Brianna- we should hang out tmr
I just stared at the text. I read between the lines and I think she likes me. I didn't reply back. Chelsea saw me and stared at me. " who you texting?" She asked with curiosity.  "Uhm no one" I said nervously. She nod her head and her eyes went straight to the t.v. I mean I loved Chelsea with all the strength in me, matter of fact I'm inlove with her.  The last thing I need is for someone to mess this relationship up for me. I grabbed her to me and let her lay on my chest. I stroke her hair. Man I really loved this girl.
