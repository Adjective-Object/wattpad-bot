"You think? I'm looking at a dead person right now!"
"Calm down. I know other humans that could see the dead. But after a while, they couldn't."
"So, you're saying that this won't last forever?"
"I think so."
"Is that good?"
"I don't know. Usually, it drives a person mad to see the dead because they run around, telling people things they aren't supposed to know and they don't believe that person. So, ghosts will leave the world and disappear somewhere. So... I won't be here for long."
"Oh... That makes no sense... But so does math... I guess they're both the same."
"I guess so."
"Anyway, I think you should go because I have school tomorrow and my mom won't let me ditch. Then afterschool, I have to go to my fucking dad's house. I really don't wanna go there."
"Why don't you wanna see your dad?"
"Because he doesn't care about this family. I haven't seen him in 4 years and it's gonna feel weird meeting him again. Plus, he doesn't check up on us at all. I don't wanna see a man who doesn't talk to me and is rarely in my life."
"Oh. Sorry.."
"Don't be. I wish I could do something about it."
"Oh. I'll help you out on that." Amy started smirking in a weird way.
"Um... okay?"
"Great! See you tomorrow!"
"Ok. But don't come to me during school. I can't have people think I'm more insane than usual."
"Sure. Bye!"
"Bye." Amy flashed away and left me all alone in my room.
Right now, everything is very confusing. Why would I be able to see the dead? Why would a ghost come to me? Is it in a good or bad way? I hope it's in a good way because I'm already scared.
