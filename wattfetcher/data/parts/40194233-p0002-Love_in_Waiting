Death smiled at her before kissing her forehead and then vanishing. After that, Life never heard from Death again. And people started dying naturally, because of sickness, old age, murders, or accidents.
Century after century passed by but never once did Life encounter Death until one day, she saw the Devil. The Devil smirked at her before passing a message.
"Death's alive."

Information:
Love in Waiting is inspired by the picture above. It's from 9Gag. I don't know who posted it but I've seen it a couple of times before and thought that it was good and wanted to write something about it but never got the chance to but now, here I am.
"Life and Death have been in love for longer than we have words to describe. Life sends Death countless gifts and Death keeps them forever."
The idea just sprang up but it's not going to be like that. Yes, it's Life and Death's love story but it doesn't follow the picture above.
Casting. So, for the cast, it will be explained further in the story as it builds up.
I hope that you guys will support this one and show your love.
