CHAPTER FOUR-TWO: THE REALITY

“Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!”
“Ching! Ching! Wake up! You’re having a bad dream.” I woke up to see Mel shaking me vigorously. Was I really dreaming? Did I just dream inside a dream? “This is what you get when you oversleep! I told you to go down already.”
“Ugh…” I can’t say a thing. I was really exhausted. That dream looked real. Everything’s still vivid in my mind. I remember how Ice invited me to this party and I agreed because he’s so damn persistent. I also remember how good-looking Art was (let’s get real here; he really does look good in a suit!). And yeah, I still remember how Ice got me drunk and stole my first kiss. I blushed at the thought of it. I can feel my cheeks warming up again.
“Why are you blushing? I thought you were having a bad dream? Was it really bad that it made you blush? Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?” Mel is bombarding me with a lot of questions. Is it my fault that my body cannot hide what I feel? Geez.
“It wasn’t even a bad dream. It was a freaking nightmare!”
“It’s the same! Nightmares are bad dreams.” She gave out a small chuckle. “Let’s go downstairs now. I’m not leaving this room unless you go with me.”
“You’re so demanding! It’s Saturday. It’s a day to relax. It’s a day to forget everything about school.” It’s a day to forget everything about Ice and his antics.
“Ok, ok. I get it. I’m demanding and all. Just go down and I’ll stop being like this to you.”
“Yeah, I will.”
==========================================================
I finally decided to give in to my sister’s nagging. I wore my favorite blue sando while still on my boxer shorts. I hurriedly followed Mel downstairs to eat breakfast. I can still sniff out the faintest smell of bacon lingering in the air. I can now say that this weekend is gonna’ be one of the best days ever!
“Ma! Thanks for cooking my favorite!” I went straight to the kitchen in order to greet Ma but I only saw Mel washing the dishes.
“Ma is not here Ching. She went out shopping with Pa.”
“Who cooked the bacons then? Was it you?” I never thought you cooked, Mel.
“Your boyfriend did it for you. Aren’t you touched?”
“Wh-what? What boyfriend? Huh?”
“He went outside to buy us sodas. Just wait for him.”
“Are you out of your mind Mel? How many times do I have to tell you I’m not gay. Geez.”
“We’ll see. Let’s wait for him to return, okay?”
“Are you serious Mel? No one, not even my friends, knew where our house is! And now, you’re telling me my boyf… someone I know visited me here… and cooked for me?”
“You’re such a meanie! You never told me you’re in a relationship. I thought we shared our secrets with each other?” She followed it up with a pout.
“I told you I have nothing to hide from you! Why aren’t you listening to me?” I’m getting annoyed by this.
==========================================================
The gates opened and our dogs didn’t even bark. It weirded me more when the dogs squealed with joy as he entered our house grounds. It’s as if the one entering has been living with us for some time already.
