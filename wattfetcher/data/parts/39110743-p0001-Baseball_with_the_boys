Victoria's P.O.V"Again!" Kris yelled at me to hit the ball again.
I stood at the home plate and said," Kris its 105 degrees we've been practicing for almost 3 hours!" I yelled.
Kris is on our team but he's coaching us today because our coach couldn't come to our practice.
"Ok guys practice is over!" Kris said.
We all grab our bags and walk out of the school.
"You walking home?" Luis asked me
"Yeah" I said
"Okay" he said walking with me.
"Our next game is against Wilson right?" I asked Luis
"Yeah tomorrow"
"Hell yeah I'm ready to kick some ass!" I said.
He laughed and i said," ugh my mom is on a business trip for a week."
"Wanna come over to my house today? Jorge, Adhrian, Allan, And Nacy are gonna be there."
"Yeah sure what time?" I asked him
"You can come over right now if you want" he said
"I need to go change first I don't wanna smell"
"I'll lend you some clothes, it might be big tho I mean because I'm 5'8 and your 4'11" he said laughing while pinching me cheeks.

We get to Luis house and I put my bag in his room and we go to his room and he hands me a pair of red basketball shirts, and one a shirt from one of his old baseball teams.
"Here you'll be number 11 for the day" he says smiling.
"Thanks" I said and I walked to the bathroom and changed
I got a liga and I tied the back of the shirt so it won't be so big.
I walked out and he said," looking cute in my clothes."
I laughed and said," number 11 cute"
He laughed. me and Luis always say things like that to each other were just really close friends, we just say things like that to eachother.
"Oh hey Allan" I said smiling.
"Hey Vic" he said hugging me.
"You ready for the game tomorrow?" Allan asked me.
"Hell yeah!" I said
