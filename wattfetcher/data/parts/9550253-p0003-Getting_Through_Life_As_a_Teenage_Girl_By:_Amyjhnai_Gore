Eden Carsewell
Well i am up and out of my bed and im singing in the shower and just to let you know i have an amazing voice only my family knows about."Ever is here honey."sreams my dad."OK dad here I come."I say."OMG Eden what in the world is in your hand."screams Ever."You like.?"i say."Oh yeah girl wow my old iphone 4s sucks but wow the 5s like wow."says Ever."Are you ready to go girl."I say.Then we both strut out of my house looking beautiful snd amazing as ever because that's how we are today.Today is the day for us we are just amazing.I am thinking to myself.When we finally reach school.Since us and our dates are in all of the same classes we all sit at the big tables two on one side two on the other."HI Eden."says David.'Are you ready for tonight?"Says jason .Oh yes we are".me and Ever say at the same time."So who is driving?"say Ever."Well I can."says jason.David and I will sit in the backseat and you and Ever can sit in the front seats."I say. "That is perfect."Says David. We go to math first an then to reading. and then after a whole day of having fun it was time to go on our date.Jason and Ever came to get me and then we went to get David.After we went to the mall and did some walking around we skipped the movie and went to eat.Then we went to see a romantic movie.That's when it happened he did it and i was in total shock.David kissed me. Ever took a picture of it on my phone and sent it to herself.That's when my heart changed i was in love with someone else and that was David Divingo."I hope this turns into a realationship between me and david."I texted Ever."Me and jason kissed too i hope we end up in a relationship."says Ever.In my mind I wants to yell at her and then my heart says that David is the right one he will love and cherish you.So i go with my heart and stayed in love. I grabbed my phone out of my purse and called David.But for some reason i hung up, i don't know why but i did.But my phone vibrated cuz i just got a mindless behavior memo.
