"Oh baby." He said and kissed my forehead. "You're awake." He sniffed causing me to smile. I motioned for him to get the bottle of water and he did, putting the water to my lips.
"Thank you." I said sounding horse.
He smiled and wiped the tears from his eyes as they fell
"Why are you crying?" I asked him and then thought. "Is it something wrong with the baby!" I asked.
He shook his head. "No. The baby is fine." He assured.
I thought about the past events. Having the baby way before my due date almost a full month thinking of all the strain I probably put on our baby, I began to cry.
"The baby. I put too much stress on the baby." I said shaking my head.
"Hush love hush. It's fine." He cooed to me. "The baby is in NICU."
"Oh god that means they're giving my baby Similac." I said worried.
"No, Kelsey wouldn't let them." He chuckled. "She had pumped some milk right in the waiting room. She said you'd appreciate the baby having her milk as opposed to Similac."
I smiled. "She's so right. Is Everybody here?" I asked.
"Yeah. Everybody's outside ." He said and kissed my lips. "I love you Joy."
"I love you too." I said and kissed him again.
"I'm gonna go get everybody. You wake up mama." He said and I nodded.
"Mama." I said and shook my hand causing her to move her head.
"Lauren." She said and hugged me.
I hugged her back and she kissed my head and then popped me.
"I should whoop you chile. Had me all types of worried." she sniffed.
"I'm sorry mama." I laughed and she kissed my head again.
"How you feeling?" She asked.
I shrugged. "A little bit of pain. I'm all good for the most part." I said.
"That's good. We gonna get a nurse to see you okay?" She asked me and I nodded.
Everyone began to flood my room. I had balloons and flowers, cards and teddy bears galore.
"Aww Yall!" I laughed seeing Erin and Kesey come in with stuff flooding their hands.
"You scared us all Lauren. Had me forgetting I was about that thug life." Erin said causing me to laugh.
"I appreciate you all for coming. I'm so sleepy y'all. All I want to do is see my baby and get so rest." I said
They all nodded. "The baby is perfect." My mother said.
"You saw already?" I asked.
"Mmhm. Everyone saw the baby except Devin." My mother pointed out.
"Speaking of Devin where did he go?" I asked
"I'm not sure but he said he had to go pick up Cara. Shouldn't have taken him so long though." Daddy said.
I nodded and allowed them to keep me company. I really need time with my husband. Today was a trying day, and i still haven't seen the baby nor has he.
"We gonna go now." My mom said and as my mother left everyone said goodbye to me.
Once I was in the room by myself I sat back and watched television for a bit trying to wait on Devin. As I began to nod off a knock sounded at the door.
