"What the hell is wrong with you?" I asked.
"Nothing, just tired" he responded without even looking up from his phone.
I got concerned but shook it off. Halfway through class, Amelia texts me. This is the conversation:
A- Hey
Hey
A- Wanna link up later?
Can't
A- Why?
You know for a fact I'm not allowed to hang with you especially if I'm hanging with Jaedan
A- The fuck did I do?
Jaedan doesn't like you and neither does the rest of the group
A- Can you tell him i said im sorry
It's not gonna work. He hates everything about you.
A- Damn.
Sorry.
Jaedan looks over at me and sees that I'm texting.
"Who ya texting?" He asked.
"Amelia" i replied bracing myself for an eruption.
I sat there like i was preparing to get hit but he didn't do or say nothing but make a disgusted face. Now I KNOW something's up. Jaedan HATES Amelia. The reason being is because Amelia used to be a member of our group. But when things got really rough, she was the one who cracked and almost got us arrested. Ever since, Jaedan doesn't even like when we mention her.
"What in the world is wrong with you?" I asked concerned.
"I'm tired and don't feel like yelling over someone who's worthless" he responded.
I looked at him with serious concern but I shook it off.
*bell rings*
Finally, class is over. We didn't do anything but do simple equations so I was extremely bored. Next was Science. As I was walking into class, Jaedan caught me and pulled me into the closet.
"I need to talk to you" he said.
"About?" I asked crossing my arms.
"I saw something last night, and I wanna show you where it's at."
"I swear, if this is one of your little pranks-" His stare cut me off. I knew he was being serious.
"After the movie, imma take you" he said.
Before i could even respond, he walked out the closet and disappeared. I swear he's like a ghost. As i walked into class, something crossed my mind. Jaedan seemed scared when he was talking. I swear, NOTHING scares this kid so whatever it was, I had to brace myself.
