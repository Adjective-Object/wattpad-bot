Foxy POV
28 plays, 6 musicals, and 3 parts as an extra. Foxy (his real name is Corey, but he loves foxes) loves to act, no matter what part he gets. He started to love acting when his mom persuaded him to try out for a part in "Charlotte's Web" when he was 7. Then he grew his career and now he always gets the male lead in most school plays.
But there's one strange thing about Foxy. When Foxy was 10, he got a role as a pirate in the elementary school play. When the play was done, foxy loved it so much, that he kept his hook and eyepatch, and started speaking in a piratey accent. He went to school like that every day after. And he still does!
Foxy gets bullied for that, stupid bullies going up to him and saying, "Why are you a stupid pirate? Can you drop the act from when you were a baby? Boo hoo." Foxy didn't get sad or depressed over them, he just got angry. The sweet little boy with the pirate accessories on once got suspended for a week for punching and soon beating up a bully after they said something like that to him. But sadly to say it, foxy can't stop his pirate ways. His accent is stuck, and taking away the eyepatch and hook would be like taking away a part of his life, his childhood, his acting, him. Who would want to do that?
Foxy has straggly red hair and acts like a ninja. GINGA! (That's a joke from my math teacher lol) His strange yellowish eyes always seem tired, as he stays up until 11 each night and then gets up at the crack of dawn.
You wouldn't believe this, but foxy pretty much hates everything in school except for drama/acting class. None of them are his style, especially math.
Now that we've covered, Bonnie the author, Chica the musical prodigy, Freddy the gleek, and Foxy the actor, let's start on how they all met...
