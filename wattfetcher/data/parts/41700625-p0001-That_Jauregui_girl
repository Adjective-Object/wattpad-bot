"Micka.....Micka....Michaela Lauren Jauregui!" My mom yells as she walks into my room." What!?" I grumble as I try to fall back to sleep."Get up we're getting Lauren from the airport" she says as she walks out of my room. I get up and go to my closet What to wear ... What to wear I thought. I get dressed in my favorite outfit.(above) Wow I look I good. I kind of look like Lauren. I mean we have the same eye color and we had the same hair color when she had brown hair.
I ran down stairs to see Taylor sittingat the table taking selfies. I walk over to the refrigerator and get a water."Was up Tay?" " Come over here." She says as she signals me to take a selfies with her which I didn't mind."How many selfies have you taken?" I ask as I took a sip of my water."75" I spit out my water and my eyes widen." Really Taylor." Chris walks in and says "Taylor, why is my Instagram feed full of you?!" "Because I'm #flawless" Chris and I roll our eyes. "Let's go!" My dad yells. "Roll out..Roll out. Me and Chris start singing. "Yay.... What eva.. let's just go." We all get into the car and leave.
