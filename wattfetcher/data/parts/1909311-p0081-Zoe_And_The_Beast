"Get out."
He continued to smile at me, even when I said that. "You've grown so much, Zoe."
"I said, 'get out'."
"I love you, Zoe. You are the best family I could have ever asked for."
And with that, Zach walked by me and left. Little did I know, I would never see my brother again.

AN// Yes, Zoe is struggling with the adoption thing. I have a few adopted friends, and I talked to them to kind of try and get a feel for their adoption stories, and I found that all of them struggled to fit in with the family, and get around the concept of  not being blood related, but still being siblings. It was hard on the siblings as well, getting around the fact that their sibling doesn't share the same DNA. At the same time, though, family can be so amazing. All my adoptive children? They couldn't be happier with their lives. They're happy with their families and happy with beinga  part of this beautiful thing - kinship.
I think Zoe's at the confused phase. She's overwhelmed by everything, and is in complete shock. She feels slightly betrayed for having found out through a source other than Zach, but she's also sympathetic. I think if I were in her shoes, I would be like her for a while too. At least a couple of hours.
