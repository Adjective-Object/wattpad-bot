"Good Morning master~" Nami said cutely to her customer, kneeling next to the table.
"Good morning." The customer answered.
"What would you like today? Master~"
"Um," The customer started, catching a fleeting glimpse at Nami's cleavage, An act Nami would normally sue someone for. "What ever, you want to give me!" He answered, blushing a bit and going into chibi mode.
"That's good."
Elsewhere...

"Master-sama~ Here's your souffl√©!" Aya exclaimed, kneeling when she approached the table.
"Thank you Aya-chwan~<3!" Her customer sang with hearts instead of eyes."
"Ploof ~I'm glad you're happy!~ Woosh!" Aya sang innocently, her cuteness was further doubled when her ears and tail popped out.
"You're so cute ~Aya-chan!"

"Ne, Robin-san." A customer said looking down.
"Hai?" Robin asked sounding as sweet as she could.
"Could you write how you feel about me!?" He asked, already going into hyper drive. Because the said man ordered Moe rice, Robin wrote with ketchup, 'I really like you'. The poor customer fainted from a terrible nosebleed.

Vivi was standing next to the countertop, awaiting her next order from the resturant's cook, Sanji. (He only agreed because Nami and Robin were working there.)
"Where is the cheesecake, Sanji-chan?"
"It's here, Vivi-chan!" Sanji exclaimed, spinning to the window. They looked at the restaurant and saw all the happy faces. Then, their attention averted to Sakura.

"Did you have a bad day today?" Sakura sang making a pout face.
"Yeah, pretty much. I failed a test today." the customer confessed, looking at the table.
"Let's play a game. It will definitely make you feel better." Sakura suggested. After playing a one-minute version of Uno, Sakura lost.
"Waah~ I lost again." Sakura faked cried, placing her hands over her face.
"Now, Now. No need to cry." The customer said gently, attempting to hug until he was slapped by a semi-warm frying pan. Sanji was there with a very digusted (it almost looked like he was jealous) and he pointed to a sign which read, 'No touching of the maids in any way, shape or form.'
^It must also be noted be noted that that rule was put by the owner because of one particular maid. (wiggles eyebrows)
Of course, that how it was like a week ago. Now in the present day...
"Nami! Robin! Aya! Saki-chan!"
"Eh?? Luffy?"
"I knew the world was ending today." Sakura sighed.
"That baka isn't getting any treatment from any of these ladies."
"Yo!"
