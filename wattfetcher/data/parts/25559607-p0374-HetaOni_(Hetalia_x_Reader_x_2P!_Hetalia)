I couldn't think of a better title for the author's note xD But...since I will be announcing some big news, might as well be straight to the point. Hahaha


BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ELSE, LET ME TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING IMPORTANT.


.......I PASSED!!!!! I PASSED THAT SPECIAL QUALIFYING EXAM I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I PASSED THAT FUTURE-DEFINING TEST. I PASSED!!! OH, THANK GOD! I PASSED!!!!!!!!


I would like to thank everyone who cheered me on, encouraged me, taught me, and prayed for me. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you to all those who were there for me by leaving a comment and just saying that they will have my back. I'm so thankful to have wonderful readers like you. I feel like crying from joy.


Out of about 1400 students, only 1200 passed...and I am blessed to be one of them :')



The Accountancy dream is still on! xD Onward to my 2nd year of college this June! <3


=*=*=*=*=*=

Okay, now that I got that out, time to talk about this chapter part....


>>(Name) and (Second Name)

—Well, since (Second Name) got her memories erased, she is therefore unaware of whatever goes on in the mansion. Due to her unawareness, she decides to just go with the flow of the things happening around her.

—(Name) ....yes, the little girl....Is you. Obviously xD The little reader will be one of the many mysteries of this mansion....as well as one of the pieces of a puzzle :3



>>Italy and (Second Name)

—Italy somehow understands how the Second Players (particularly, his counterpart) are concerned about the reader. Italy also knows how it is possible for a person to suddenly lose their memories in the mansion. It did happen to him, after all. He just doesn't know how it exactly happened to the reader, but he probably assumes it's because of all the emotionally draining events took a toll on the girl.

—(Second Name) does find Feliciano familiar. She finds a lot of things to be familiar....but the painful thing about that.....is that no matter how much she feels the familiarity, she couldn't bring herself to remember what it was exactly.


—OH! BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE WHO REMEMBER OR KNOW WHAT THE METAL OBJECT WAS....YOU GET....okay...I don't have anything good to offer....so.....YOU GUYS GET A FREE VIRTUAL HUG. XD \(>w<)/
