Jordan's POV
"I love you." She said.
"I love you so much." I said before sniffling and shedding a few more tears.
She sobbed into my neck asking me how this happened over and over making me feel like I did something wrong somehow.
--Hey you finally left me tears--
"Hey." I said.
"What?" She asked.
"I love you." I said.
"Oh, Jordan. I love you." She responded.
"Hey! Ha ha." I screamed with a smile after she made out with me.
"What?" She chuckled.
"I love you."
"Mmm hmm?" She said ish while kissing me, I mean she was kissing me so she couldn't really form actual words.
"You're so cute. You're so adorable." I said.
"I love you." She said.
"Mmm hmm." I said while kissing her.
"Oh, Jordan." She said.
"Hmm. Mmm hmm, yeah, yup."
"What?" She asked.
"Yeah, you definitely are cute."
"Shut up." She said.
"No, really. You are cute." I told her.
"Stop it." She screamed. I grabbed her thigh and kissed her. Grabbing her side though was a bad idea, I made her squeal and bite my lip.
Erin's POV
"Ow! Damn!" He said.
"Well, it was your fault!" I screamed.
"Oi." He said.
"You've successfully killed the moment, Jordan." I said.
"Crap, sorry." He said sounding dissapointed.
"Oh, I revived it." I said as I stood up.
"Great!" He exclaimed.
"Whoo!" I yelled as Jordan grabbed my thigh and pulled my knee up so it was resting on his hip. My stomach felt empty all of a sudden, I got nervous?
"My lip still hurts." He said.
"Not my fault." I said.
"It wasn't?" He asked.
"Oh my god! Your lip is bleeding, Jordan!" I said.
"See? You made me bleed." He said.
"Oh, moment suicide." I said as I grabbed a napkin and put it on his lip.
"You made me bleed?" He asked.
"I did not, Jordan!" I said angrily.
"You made me bleed, babe." He said.
"You did this."
