Ash shouted, he doesn't like doing this but if he doesn't , heck if any of us don't it will just happen to us."No it wasn't. Now we know her weakness. Family. OMG YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THIS IS?! " Jenna said." Whatever Jen." Cal rolled his eyes and him , mike and Ash walked away, the jocks left after Lily ran away." Jen that was a little too far , you shouldn't bring her family into this." I said " LUKE! This is amazing, this is the only REAL reaction we've gotten in a long time!" Jen said excitedly."Im gonna go to band practice " I was trying to ovoid a fight"OK" she said with a smile
