Little did he know that this one be day one of the rest of his life.* James arrives at school and runs to first period because he is late and there is finals today. As I run through the hallways if felt weird that I would never do this again in this school. FUCK! Good morning Mr. Anderson you're late. Said Mrs. Lawrence (James English teacher) you're late again to class.... And on the last day... do you have a fucking watch? I'm so sorry Mrs. L it won't happen again. Sarcastically said James.
