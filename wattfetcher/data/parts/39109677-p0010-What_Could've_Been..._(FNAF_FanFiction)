OK, it's FRIDAY!!! so I'll be posting a lot on this and my other story over the weekend, and sorry about the dinged up schedule in this book! It's supposed to take place in high school, but I'm not in high school yet... so yeah.
I'm sorry that lunch is third period, but I think that high school starts pretty late in the day, and I have no fucking clue about how long homeroom lasts, (we don't have it at my middle school) so I just counted it as an entire period. Srry if I'm wrong!
But we have lunch 4th period at my school, and since I counted homeroom as a period, I quess it just made sense to me to put it in as the next class! Srry again for my SHI-TAY high school knowledge, I'll try to do better!
