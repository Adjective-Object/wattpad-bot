At about 4am, I woke up thinking my husband has gotten up to use the restroom. I used the moment to steal back the sheets, only to wake him in the process. I apologized and told him I thought he got out of bed. When he turned to face me, he gasped and pulled his feet from under the end of the bed so quickly his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing.
After adjusting to the dark for a half second, I was able to see what caused the strange reaction. At the foot of our bed, sitting and facing away from us, there was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. Its body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it. But more concerned as to its condition. At this point I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed go help him.
My husband was peering over his arm and knee, tucked into a fetal position, occasionally glancing at me before returning to the creature.
