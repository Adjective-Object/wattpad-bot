"Yes, yes, yes, of course!" Castiel squealed it out like a little girl.They shared a long, heartfelt kiss.
"Now, I know we're still in the park, but the kiss was a little bit of a surprise."
"Dean. I don't care that we're in a park."
"Really?"
"Yes, because I'm really loving the sound of Castiel Winchester, and that means if I'm having sex in a bush, it's okay as long as its with you."
"Aw, Cas, I didn't know you were such a softie."
"Shut up, and agree to the terms and conditions."
"I agree. I agree to sex in a bush."
