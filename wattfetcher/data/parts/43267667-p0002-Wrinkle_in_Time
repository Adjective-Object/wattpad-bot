I pictured Jean, she had a cute beanie on and a coat and it was snowing outside. She made a snow ball and threw it at me, I laughed, "You're gonna get it now, Baby!" I chased after her and slipping on ice, falling on my ass.
She giggled and came over to help me up, but in the end, just ended up on top of me.
I shook my head as I opened my eyes, "That was weird... It felt real... For a second..."
I grabbed my jeans off the floor and reached inside the pocket, my eyes widening when I didn't feel the napkin.
"Aww, come on! You gotta be kidding me!" I growled.
'The one girl I meet and actually like, and I fucking lose her number!' I flop down on my bed and cover my eyes with my hands and groan as I think of last night.
I drop my hands and open my eyes to see the bartender in front of me, I look down and see my half drank beer sitting on the bar.
"Da fuck...?" I whispered as I look over and see Jon wink at the same girls and they giggle and walk off.
'Am I? Did I? What the fuck!? I have to be dreaming!' I pinched my arm and yelped, making Jon give me a weird look, "You oki, Luke?"
I nodded quickly, "Uhh, yeah! Just fine!"
I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned around and saw Jean smiling at me, "Jean!"
She looked at me like I was a freak, "Uhh, how do you know my name...?"
"Ohh, uhh, just a lucky guess!" I said nervously, 'What is happening?!'
She smiled awkwardly and backed up, "Umm, well, oki then, never mind..."
My eyes widen, 'Fuck!'
I squeezed my eyes shut and thought of 5 minutes ago and didn't flip out as much this time...
