~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ROSES MOTHERS P.O.V.

I was 7 months pregnant ,and I had decided to tell my husband the gender of our baby.
"Darling we are gonna have a beautiful baby girl!"
I exclaimed. "Honey that's great! What will her name be? How about Rose? I have always liked that name." My husband said.
"That's a great name! I cant wait until she meets us!" I said.
My lovely husband included "I will spoil her ,but I will also teach her respect!" I he had hugged me from behind and buried his face in the crook of me neck.
~2 months later~

"Ok ma'm the next contraction is going to hurt so when you feel it i'm going to need you to push!"
I nodded and felt the pain "AHHHHHH!!!" I screamed.
I was told to push so I did so. "AHHHHH!!!" I screamed once more.
The nurse said "Ok I can see the head! I need you to push harder!"
I nodded and pushed harder. Then the nurse said " ONE MORE PUSH!"
I nodded and pushed ever harder! "AHHHHHHH!!!" I yelled once more.
The nurse took the baby and let me rest. She came back with the infant wrapped in a pink blanket with little roses on the blanket. She gave me the infant and I looked at her. She had my hair, my husbands facial structure, and my light red eyes.
She opened her big red eyes, looked at me, then smiled, a small, little smile. My husband ran through the doors and looked at us and I said
"Look at our child! She has a your facial features and your smile!"
He looked at her and said "Can I hold her?"
I said "yes silly! You don't have to ask to hold her!"
He grabbed a hold of her and she looked him in the eye, smiled and buried her face in his chest
That was only the beginning.

~1 YEAR LATER~
(Still in Mothers P.O.V.)
I was sitting on the couch watching t.v. until Rose crawled up to me and tugged at my pants. I turned and said "Yes Rose? Do you wanna try to walk again?"
She smiled and laughed as if to say 'yes'. So, I picked her up and brought her the the center of the room and I stood in a corner and told her to walk to me. She stood still for a moment but then the most amazing thing happened. She took a step to me, then she took another, and another, and another until she was walking straight to me. Rose came to me in a matter on seconds! I picked her up and said "YOU WALKE! YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED!!!"
She rubbed against my face as if to say 'I know I did!' then she said slowly "M-M-Mo-mommy!"
I hugged her again and said "Yes! Yes! Sweety i'm your mommy!"
She smiled and said "Mommy!! I wove yow!!"
