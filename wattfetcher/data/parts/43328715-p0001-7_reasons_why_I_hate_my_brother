7 reasons why I hate my brother.
1) he is always lurking. Over my shoulder, behind the sofa, eyes looming over my book. He's always there.
2) there's his shoes in my doorway I'm not allowed to move, and their presence fills the room so much I can't bear to look. They're these dirty, worn down chucks, ruining my room. But in my doorway they stay.
3) he upsets my mum. He makes her cry into her dinner plate while the rest of us stare. He doesn't come to comfort her at all, just watches her tears salt her food.
4) he's stuck in school. His homework remains unfinished on the desk, his grades fall into nothing, he fails every class and doesn't try to change it.
5) he doesn't walk the dog. I have to do it instead, cursing him in my head for having to take over his chore. It's always dark and it's always raining and the dog hates me for not being him. The rain seeps through the seams of my clothes, and I stay wet for ages.
6) he's turned nineteen but what does he have to show for it? We lit nineteen candles on a cake and they blew away on their own. We all made nineteen wishes and piled his gifts on the table. There was nothing new for my mum to brag about.
7) he left me. He climbed into that car, with his best friends. And he was drunk. They all were drunk. He saw the crash and the sparks and he left me, even though he knew what it meant. He crashed his car and he died. I hate him for leaving me.
