"Stop-pl-Stop! Andrew!" I keep trying to get a word out but he is very persistent. He picks me up and throws me on his bed and hovers over me as I try to get up.
"But princess, you look so sexy in those pants, I wonder what you look like under neath?" he then reaches for my zipper and button but I slap his face and try to scoot away, didn't work. He grabs my waist band and yanks them open revealing my underwear.
"LUKE!!HELP ME! LUKE PLEASE!" I scream ripping my vocal cords to shreds probably. Andrew covers my mouth and starts to take his jeans off until I hear a door slam open.
"GET OFF OF HER REESE!" Luke grabs his shirt collar and punches him, hard. I could hear a crack and I shudder. Michael and Calum run in and grab him and hold him against the wall so he couldn't run away. Luke helps me up and I pull my pants back on and Luke walks over to Andrew and starts wailing on his face and mid section. Luke stops after a few hits and Andrew drops to the ground kneeling before us.
"We are leaving. Now. Michael, Calum you too." Luke was going to murder someone at this point if he doesn't leave soon. I start to walk away but Andrew grabs my ankle and tries to take me down, but I kick him in the face with the back of my heel in the eye.
"YOU BITCH! You're a whore and a bitch!"
"If I was a whore, then why are you bleeding all over the floor?" I say as I walk out. I strut out and down the stairs and out the door to Lukes car.
"Alex, you okay? Are you hurt? Did he do anything to you? If so I'll kill him!"
"Luke, I'm fine but he bruised my wrists a little. But other than that I'm fine. Just take me home please?" I needed to be home about now. So we got in as Calum and Michael trailed behind back to my house. I hate parties, why me?
