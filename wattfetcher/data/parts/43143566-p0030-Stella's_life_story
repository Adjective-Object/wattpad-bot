when alex left two hours later i ammideatly tryed escaping upstares but wasnt so lucky-as usual..-.-
,"where do you think your going?"dad asked making me groan inwardly.i tried ignoring him but mother spoke up
,"what are you doing?"my shoulders slumped irritated,"going upstairs."i said causiously.,"get down here and do your homework"GOD-*sigh*....
i walked down the stares as i heard mother babble on.as i got into the kitchen and sat down at the table i opened my laptop and plugged my earphones in so i could listen to music.
but however this world wasn't nice to me..again..and again..it shouldn't be a shocker..as i played the song i was listening to it played out loud instead of in the earphones..
i cursed silently so they didn't hear me.getting irritated at the computer i played a different song that fitted my mood well and started my social studies bull rap homework..
