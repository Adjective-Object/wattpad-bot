Christina POV
Me and my other 5 sisters were at the park. At a secret park. No one else comes to this park except me and my sisters. As far as I know no one else does.
We were all chatting up a storm except Lauren. She's been acting strange lately. She won't tell anybody what's wrong she just goes with the flow. Don't know why.
"I'm hungry," Dani blurted out. We all looked at her.      "Same here," Amy and Katherine said.       "I could eat," Lisa and I both said. Lauren stayed quite. Katherine stood up.        "What you guys want to eat?" She asked.        "Fried chicken," Dani said.        "Make that two," I spoke up. Then focused on Lauren.          "Pasta," Amy and Lisa both said. Then everyone looked at Lauren. She looked up.           "What?" Lauren said looking at us.          "Want anything to eat?" Katherine asked her. Lauren shook her head. Umm. Everyone started talking. I looked at Lauren. She didn't look to good. Right then Lauren stood up and started walking away.           "Lauren?" I say. She stops and looks at me.           "I'll be right back. I'm just using the restroom," Lauren replied. I hope she'll be okay. The bad thing is all of us except her had a cold last week and if she's getting that,that might be bad.
Katherine came back with everyones food. We all started to eat. Katherine looked around.       "Where's Lauren?" She questioned.        "She went to the restroom,but has been in there for at least 20 minutes or so," Lisa said. We all ate. All of a sudden we heard a scream. We all stood up and looked at the restrooms.          "Did you say Lauren went to the bathroom awhile ago?" Everyone shook there heads. Lisa started walking we all stayed back. Lisa got to the restroom and went in. Five minutes later nothing.           "Maybe we should go?" Amy suggested. We all shook our heads. We all ran to the restrooms. I went in first then the rest of my sisters followed. There was no sign of Lauren. Amy went and check out all the stalls. "Lisa?" All of us went down to Amy. Lisa was not awake she seemed fine though. I started hearing sobs. I turned around and seen Dani crying. I went over to her.
"Dani what's wrong?" I ask her. She looks up at me then points to red stuff on the ground. Oh my god! "Grab Lisa! We need to find Lauren!" Katherine grabbed Lisa and we all went outside.
