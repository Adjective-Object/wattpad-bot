He went to kiss me when the one and only Mike Fuentes walked over and pulled him away from me, "Our meet and greet is starting in like a minute. You two can have fun later." He said dragging Vic away.
Vic glared at him before he smiled and blew me a kiss making me smile. What a sweetheart.
Thankfully I'm done setting the last of this up I can go find Alan and see what's wrong. I ventured around the venue looking for him but didn't see him anywhere but found Austin talking with Tino.
"Hey Austin, Tino." I said walking up to them, "Have you guys seen Alan?"
"He should be on the bus. He's doing his project." Austin said, "He should be here soon though if anything."
"Alright well I'm going to go talk to him."
"He's pissy so be cautious." He warned.
"Oh I've got this don't worry." I said, "See you guys later."
"Bye Kells!"
"Bye!" I said and hurried to Of Mice's bus. Once I got there I went straight on the bus. "Alan?" I called.
I heard a groan from the bunks, "What?"
"Are you okay?" I asked and went on back and pushed his curtain back.
"Yeah why?"
"Well everyone told me that you've been in a pissy mood so I came to check on you." I said and sat down next to him.
"Well everything's just fucking peachy."
"Doesn't sound like it." I said, "Come on Al tell me what's going on."
"But it sounds really bad and it is Kellin."
"You know you can tell me it's okay."
"I miss Roy."
"You what!?" I asked angrily.
"See! I know it's terrible and everything. I really do like Austin and all I do. He's perfect and amazing. But Roy was just being so sweet yesterday then today but then he was a dick and I got mad but I got over it. He was being really sweet earlier today and I-I remembered all the good times I had with him and it's all a mess Kells."
"Alan do I need to remind you of all the times he hurt you or sent you to the hospital." I said softly, "I know there was times where he was a perfect gentleman and was sweet but he did more bad than good and Austin hasn't done a single thing to you I mean he's never laid a hand on you like Roy did."
He nodded, "I know and I do like Austin. Don't get me wrong. He's never done me harm or anything like Roy. But you didn't know Roy like I did Kellin."
"Yeah but I've seen Roy hit you before and that's all I need to know. You're better than that and you know it." I said and wrapped my arm around him. "What did he even say that has you thinking like this? Last I check you hated him."
"He told me he loved me."
"Of course he did, the last time he said that what happened to you?" I asked.
"Nothing happened."
"He broke your nose."
"It wasn't broken."
"It was broken."
"So, he said he was sorry. He didn't mean to do it."
"What about the time before that when he beat you up because you accidentally broke a plate?"
