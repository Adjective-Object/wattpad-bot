It....just.....can't.....



No...





No...



"NO!!!" I shouted angrily, tears streaming down my cheeks.



Surprisingly, my reaction made them flinch a little, but not as bad as a certain Luciano Vargas.



"Ragazza...It's....true. This isn't...your first time loop." Luciano said, his voice starting to sound a bit hoarse.



Lutz turned to his Italian ally and asked, "What are you talking about? How come we didn't know about this?"



"S-See! Your comrades don't even know! You were just lying, right?! This...." I turned to look at the lifeless body laid down beside me on the floor. "....this is...just fake, right?" I said, my voice cracking.



Both First Players and Second Players just looked at me in silence, no one seemed like they knew what to say. They were all covered in blood, clutching their injured bodies, with geniune expressions of shock and confusion. All of them were there in the hall with me, even Canada and the others who were previously resting on the floor when they got beaten up from the fight. All of them were just as confused as I were.



All except one.




"Luciano....what is this sick scheme you're trying to pull?" I said, gritting my teeth.



The Italian shook his head. "I'm not making this up, ragazza. This is all true. You weren't supposed to find out....but....you did die. I know." he said with a pained expression.



"How could I possibly believe you?! And how do you even know?!!" I shouted.
