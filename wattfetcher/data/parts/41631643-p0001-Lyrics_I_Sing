She loved her, like thatBut telling her family? They might snapSo confined she confideShe was playing girl games off lineShe had an answer but she didn't ask for thisEvery little chit chat was a massive riskIf she discussed it they'd be disgustedDisown her and that'd be disastrousShe knew that it wasn't their fault, they were brainwashed They believed some crazy thingsIt'd cause her a smorgasbord of disordersIf she listened to what they would thinkThey thought she was smiling, but they misidentifiedBecause the clenching of her teeth was just her biting on the lieAnd her logic said:
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okayThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait one more dayThere's nothing wrong with you, it them- they're just backwards You're in the future, they're in the pastAnd they would abuse you I they knew the facts about it
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okayThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait until you're safeYou love her!Don't ever feel you should apologizeCan't control your feelings or compromiseI know it's difficult to find a guiding light now but you'll come out alive so,
Hold on!Until you find the friends who'll support youUntil you find a place you feel secure, you need to
Hold on!Until your independentWherever in the spectrum you are
Hold on!Until you find the friends who'll support youUntil you find a place you feel secure, you need to
Hold on!Until your independent Wherever in the spectrum you are( it's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay)
They didn't ask, he didn't tellIf they found out, they'd give him hell If they knew the lowdown that he felt for people regardless of pronounsHe was already tormented everydayBut it'd escalate if he couldn't keep a straight face// so what'll crack firstThe eggshells he treads in or himself?Online he was everything he wantedBut real life wouldn't let him be as honestIt'd just bring violence his way like:"How do you like this attention you special snowflake?"Thy had problems at home and had to vent their feelingsOr an underdeveloped since of empathyBut knowing that didn't make it any easierAll he could do was breathe till his logic said:
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okayThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait for one more day Step back from the situation the worlds not a movie, it's not fiction You can't think "say it, they'll accept it"Some people kick you down just because you're different
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okayThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait until your safeBe rationalUnless you think they won't attack at allYou gotta keep it in man, be practicalAnd I know you feel trapped and small right now but you'll come out alive!
I can choose my friends and I can choose my familyIf they won't accept me then others will have meI can choose my friends and I can choose my familyIf they won't accept me then others will have meI can choose my friends and I can choose my familyIf they won't accept me then others will have me so,
Hold on!Until you find the friends who'll support youUntil you find a place you feel secure, you need to
Hold on!Until your independentWherever in the spectrum you are
Hold on!It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay!
Hold on!It'll be okay, it'll be okay!
