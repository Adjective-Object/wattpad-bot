Ok so this is basically gonna be where I ask you guys questions about if you have ever done something you say yes or no and tell meh what happened :D
I feel like a teacher
I'll give you fandom homework.
I'm gonna read divergent today... Anywayss
-Have you ever said a bad word to a teacher?
I have, she ignored me for some time after.
-Have you ever been in an argument, said something incredibly stupid and everyone laughs?
All da time people
-Have you ever laughed at something horrible and than regret it?
Like just today i was talking about how Justin Bieber made a lot of people cut and commit suicide because he's an idiot.
My friend said,"Imagine someone went on top of a tall building, jumped off it yelling,'THIS IS FOR JUSTIN BIEBERRR!"
I started laughing really hard at that image and after like 10 seconds I stopped and said,"Oh gosh that's horrible."
I'm seriously bi polar
- Have you ever talked about someone and they were right behind you?
XD XD YAS!
- have you ever said something EXTREMELY mean that you still regret?
Man okay I'm gonna liberate myself from this sin
One time I was REALLY MAD I DONT REMEMBER WHY And I muttered,"Gosh I wish some people didn't exist."
This is probably the meanest thing I have done.
I'm sorry ;-;
Ok so that's it!
So I was wondering, would anyone want me to tell you twenty random facts about me?
You guys can always ask me questions about myself and I'll answer
Rules:
1) I always have to answer no matter how embarrassing
2) I have to answer honestly
3) I DO NOT want to receive questions asking me about anything gross
