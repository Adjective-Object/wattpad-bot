Photo in media above is cat and her sister.----------------------------------------------Okay!Book 4 I've made!Okay so this is really important as some of you may know my other books I've made has have depression in them so this book will have a little.so if you don't like that kind of stuff please don't continue reading.
Also I'm making this book with a friend basically I'm cat And she's the sister who will later be mentioned I have cats POV but my friend is making the sisters POV on her page so if you want to read both POV then check her out to her username is Fierywythp just to note Cats POV is mine so did not at all means copy hers where just working together and jotting down ideas as we go.
Another note since me and her are working together the story's will have slow updates but I promise you we will do the best we can to update fast Also she much more busier than I am so I might update a little faster one more thing I'll be mostly updating every week on Saturdays Sundays or Fridays *If I don't Slap me over comments*I hope most of you will bear with us on this story.
And we own most if the plot and voltage owns the some of the characters
One last thing We have a playlist put together for you guys so don't download if you don't want to just some songs that will fit into the plot of the story or might not well try our best every chapter I'll be the one to show the playlist okay well I don't want to keep rambling on if you like please Comment vote or just reading is simply enough okay well bye?    :-)
