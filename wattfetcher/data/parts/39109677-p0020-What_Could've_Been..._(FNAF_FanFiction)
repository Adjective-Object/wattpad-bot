It's a dry erase board, so I can talk to you...Sorta.

The others looked at me oddly. "You... Should try to really talk," Freddy said, his voice thick with emotion.

I told you, I don't think I can.

"Well you should at least try," Goldie insisted, and I shifted my gaze to the floor.

I...Can't

I finished the statement and held up the board for the others to see.
"Dammit!" Foxy screamed, startling me, "Why did those asses do this to you?! It's...horrible." he suddenly hugged me and whispered, "I'll get your voice back for you. No. Matter. What."

ðŸ’ŽTimeskip to Movie Time!ðŸ’Ž

I sat, huddled between Bonnie and Foxy, both were giving me an extreme hug from each side. We were watching The Never Ending Story, one of my favorite movies. I cried for some of it, and that's when the boys had started hugging me.
The movie ended and I brought my board in front of me, shaking off Bonnie and Foxy as I moved.

If it's the never ending story, then why does the movie end? Shouldn't it be infinite?

Everyone began laughing at my "comment," but there was a sadness layered beneath it. They're still sad I can't talk...

Guys, I think we should go to sleep, even if it's saturday, 3 in the morning is a little late

Everyone nodded and set off towards their rooms. I couldn't help but feel a little guilty. They really wan't to hear me talk...

ðŸ’¤Ten Minutes Later When Everyone Was AsleepðŸ’¤

I took a deep breath in, opened my mouth, and tried to talk. Nothing. Came. Out. I punched the wall, and it made a huge dent, a loud thud, and gave me a bloody fist. I sat down on my bed, crying silent tears of disappointment. Why? Why can't I do it?! Why... Why am I so fucking useless?! I choked on my tears and let out another silent sob. I punched the headboard and the part I hit splintered off, leaving deep bloody gashes in my hand. I can't even feel it... I didn't even try to scream for help as I began to feel dizzy from blood loss, it wouldn't make a difference anyway.
I saw the pool of blood around my feet grow larger, and watched silently as the sheets around me were died red. So this is how I die...A quiet end for a silent person...
I began to fall over, and before I knew it, I'd hit the floor. I laid there, unmoving, sure my end would come soon...when I felt myself being picked up and heard sobbing.
I struggled to open my eyes, and saw Goldie standing over me, I was now laid on the bed. His lithe frame was racking with sobs as he clutched my wrists, trying to stop the blood flow.
