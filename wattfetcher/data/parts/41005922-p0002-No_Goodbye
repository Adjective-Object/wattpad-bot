It was the next morning and I got woke up from my sleep by the world's most annoying alarm.
I unwrapped myself from my pink fluffy blanket. My stomach had butterflies as I remembered my Grandmother is shipping me of to Florida.
I finished packing the last few things up my last few things. I started moving my spotty luggage into the hall when I realised I almost forgot a photo of me and my parents hanging on my wall. I looked at it for a while then picked it up and took it out the frame.
I then threw my hair into a messy bun and put on a superdry tracksuit and my new Adidas zx flux. I walked out my room to almost walk into my grandmother. We didn't speak until she asked me."Good morning Emily do you won't some breakfast before your flight" I glared at her and I think she got the idea I wanted her to leave me alone.
I skipped breakfast today . instead I started getting my bags into my grandmother's car. She then 15 minutes later came running out with my plane tickets and my and hers handbags "Emily hurry get into the car"I hoped into the car and sorted my handbag out. The good thing about not staying here is I won't be bored out of my head and I didn't have any friends to say bye to any way.
By the time I got to the airport it was around 7:00. I had a long while to go. As soon as I got all my bags onto a trolley my grandmother said bye and shot of. I'm definitely not on good terms with my grandmother so she will DEFINITELY not be getting a Christmas card.
At 7:50 I started boarding the plane. At this moment I was pretty excited about a new start. Hopefully I will be able to have a better life out in Florida!
