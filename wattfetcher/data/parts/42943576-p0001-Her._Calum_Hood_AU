Calum Hood"I'm fucking serious Ryan get out!" I watched as she pointed her finger towards the assholes car. "You know you want it baby." He slurred getting closer to her. "Leave." She put a hand on his chest gritting her teeth. "Bexley baby." He said sounding aroused. "No don't baby me." She pushed at him when he reached out to her. "Stop being a bitch and let me in." He said now angry. "GET THE FUCK OFF MY PROPERTY!" She slapped him. Hard. I could hear the echo all the way from my terrace. "Stupid whore." He muttered holding his cheek as he slugged himself over to his car. "Shit." She muttered to herself sitting on her front step and putting her face in her hands.I watched her as she sat there. Letting out large breaths. It hurt. Watching her hurt. I felt as if my heart was going to burst at the thought of her crying. She just sat there at 5 in the morning on her front door step. In her Blink 182 tee shirt that covered almost most of her thighs. I then decided to make an extremely stupid decision and go down to talk to her. Quickly throwing my grey no morals jumper and quickly making my way down trying not to wake my parents or Mali up in the process. I stepped off my porch and into the cool August air. Nervously walking over to her my teeth chattered. Man up hood Jesus Christ. "Are you okay?" At my voice her head snapped up in shock. Her eyes were tear stained and I made my way over to her taking a seat next to her. "Fantastic." She said sarcastically giving me a week smile. "I'm Calum Hood by the way we're neighbors." I motioned to my house. "I know who you are. I moved in two months ago not two days." She chuckled patting the spot next to her. I made my way next to her. Sitting with my hands in my lap playing with my fingers. "Bexley." She said after a few minutes of comfortable silence. "Huh?" I turned to her."That's my name. Bexley." She told me running a hand through her jet black hair. "It's different. Good different." I told her and she smiled moving closer and resting her head on my shoulder. "I like you Calum. You're different. Good different." She told me picking up my hand to observe my tattoos. "What do they mean?" She asked tracing the initials on my hands. "They're my parents initials." I explained. "Do you have anymore tattoos?" She asked lifting her head a bit to look at me. "You want to see them?" I ask she nodded eagerly. I shrugged slipping off my jumper feeling the cool night air on my bare chest. "This one." I pointed to the MMXII"It the Roman numeral for 2012 The year I met my best friends." I tell her as she looked at me with interest written clearly in her eyes. "This one." She pointed to the bird on my forearm. "Who's Mali-Koa." She asked. "She's my sister. She's amazing she's one of my favorite people in the world." I tell her smiling. I spent the next hour on that porch steps with her. Shirtless as she asked me various questions about my tattoos and their meaning. "Do you want to tell me what happened before?" I asked gently.She nodded letting out a breath. "I met him at a party. I was drunk he was horny and one thing led to another. When I woke up he told me what happened and I was honestly disgusted. I'm not a virgin but he had no right to take advantage of me when he was completely sober. I yelled at him to get out but he kept just trying to take off the clothes I had put on. So I kicked him out and threatened to call the cops." She shook her head and frowned. "Piece of shit." I muttered under my breath. "Calum why did you come help me today?" She looked up at me with those gold eyes and my heart started beating rapidly."I heard the yelling so I was out on my terrace when I saw you slap him. You looked so sad and I couldn't stand to just watch you hurt. I'm sorry I know I sound creepy." I muttered realizing how embarrassing that was."I think." She turned her body to me. You're the sweetest boy I've ever met." She smiled kissing my cheek.
