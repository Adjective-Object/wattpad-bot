Nikki's P.O.V
I got out of my bed and in the shower. Tired but got up anyway because of school. I took a shower and pulled on some clothes not really puting in any effort. Simple outfit, blue shirt, some skinny jeans, and blue hightops with the peace sign on the back. I had a feelin this school year was gonna be diffrent all of a sudden. I dont know why, mostly cuz it was in the middle of the year, but i felt that way. Grabbing my jean jacket, my Galaxy S 3, and my school bag I headed down stairs.
Rochelle:Nikki can i brush ur hair
Nikki:*smiles* ofcoarse baby girl
Rochelle is my little sister. She's 12 almost 13. She likes to do my hair before we head to school. Were 5 years apart so I drive us to school every day. My parents arent around anymore. There not dead but there not here either. Honestly I dont know were they are. They said they'ed be back but that was obviosly a lie. I pushed the thoughts of my parents away from my head and grabbing my sky blue brush that had white clouds on it and handed it to my sister. She brushed my hair for a bit why we both drunk our breakfast fruit smoothies. We talked about what we are going to do as far as school. After she finished my hair I grabed my snapback and put it on my head along with some black nerd glasses. Rochelle grabbed her book bag and fixed her pink shirt, black pants and pink hightops. she grabbed her Galaxy S 2 and headed to my car. Since she was in middle school now i made sure she had a phone with her. I droped her off at Booker T. Washington and headed to Baltimore's School for the Arts.
The day went by like usual, Goin to class, Talkin to my best friend Jayla and my (fake) girlfriend Shadawn, Goin to some more classes, Heading to Rochelle's school, Talkin to my old princable and Goin home. Whe we got home I noticed we had mail. It was an envolope with my name on it. It had the letters YTA(Youth Talent Assotiation) I imeadiatly tore the letter open and scanning it.

I screamed at the top of my lungs cuasing Rochelle to fly in to the room looking scared and confused. I gave her the note and she read it. While she was reading it i texted Shadawn and Jayla to get here as fast as they could. Within the next minute they were at my door. They walked in the house with note's in there hand seeing YTA on them. We all (including Rochelle) screamed as loud as we could and jumped around the house shouting 'WERE MOVING TO ENGLAND'. In that moment I realized why this year is so diffrent.

3 WEEKS LATER
We (Rochelle and I) were on the plane ready to take off and fly to england. Rochelle fell asleep for the majoridy of the plane ride while I listened to music on my phone and went into my own world. I scanned the plane and looked at every person. I oy saw one person about my age. He was slim and his hair was up in a quiff. He had on Black boots, Black jeanes, Black and Grey shirt and a Black jacket. Alot of Black dont ya think? He has a little stubble on his chin. I found it very attractive. He was more on the light caramel side. His eyes were brown which pulled me to him even more, Dark color but very vibrant non-the-less. He was sitting next to a boy with brown curls and seemed more 'out there' i guess than Mr.Quiff. He had on a Blue-ish grey shirt, jeans that im pretty sure were tighter than mine, and some black boots aswell, with a dark colored jacket draped over him that I couldnt reconize the color of from here. They both had tattoo's running down there arms. I seen partiall of a tattoo on the curly haired one's chest which I assume was a bird. I liked there tattoo's. For some reason it seemed as if there was a reason for them being on the plane but that reason was unknown to me. Both of them were very attractive but Mr.Quiff stands out more than Curly Shirly. I decided to take a selfie and upload it to Instagram so thats what I did. I took it with my Sister sleepin and tagged her in it.( yea i let her have an Instagram she promised she wouldnt do anything stupid)
