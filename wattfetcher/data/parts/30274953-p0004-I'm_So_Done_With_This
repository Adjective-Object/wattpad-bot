We had a free day in computer class last month and we were aloud to walk around the class and do stuff like that. And one of my friends, decided to do one of those things where you kick in the air and your foot will touch your hand. The first time she did it but it didn't touch her hand. So she did it a second time, this time it touched her hand. But, her shoe fell off her foot and it hit the ceiling. Dust came down and it looked like it was snowing. It was hilarious.
