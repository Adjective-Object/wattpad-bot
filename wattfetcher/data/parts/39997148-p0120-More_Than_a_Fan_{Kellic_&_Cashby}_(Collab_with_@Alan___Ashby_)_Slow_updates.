"I am too." He said softly, " I'll see you around."
"Alan."
"What?"
"Can I have a kiss goodbye?"
He bit his lip nervously but sighed and kissed my cheek.
"You know what I mean Al."
"I don't think that would be a good idea Austin."
"Please just one last kiss?"
He sighed but kissed me anyway. He wrapped his arms around my neck and mine went around his waist. He kissed me harder and that's when I felt tears. I pulled away from him and he was crying.
"Hey, hey- Al what's wrong?" I asked wiping the tears off of his cheeks.
"I c-can't." He said kissing me once more, "I'm sorry Austin."
"You can't what?" I asked pushing his hair out of his face.
"I have to go." He said trying to pull away from me, "Please let me go."
I sighed and let him go, "Okay, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry too." He said taking my hand and giving it a squeeze. "I'll see you on the bus later."
"Yeah."
He smiled before walking back into the building and I stood outside alone with a broken heart.
