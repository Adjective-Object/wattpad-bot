I sighed.
I was doing a lot of that lately.
Sighing.
I was probably confusing this little girl.
"Did someone hurt you?"she asked looking at me with wide eyes.
"Yeah.How'd you know?", I asked curiously.
"My mommy got the same look in her eyes when my dad left."
My head suddenly snapped towards her.
Damn this world and the messed up people.
The people who won't even stay with the people who love them
"I'm sorry."
"Wasn't your fault.I need to go home my mommy needs me"
She started to walk away.
I started walking too.
I used to run home.
You are on the track team though.
Running reminds me of you.
Walking reminds me of you.
Just get out of my head already.
Just stop invading my brain with thoughts of you.
Gosh I finally understand when people say its like a drug.
Even when I try to ween off of you.
When I am done with you.
Habits overtake me.
Habits make me want you.
You are worse than a drug you are ....
You are the unconscious ability to breath without thinking it.
I don't know I am thinking about you.
I don't know you are keeping me going.
Yet you are.
You are my habit.
You are my drug.
You are my breath.
Frankly you are every broken fragment of my soul.
I'm not surprised I am standing at your doorstep.
A welcome mat underneath my feet.
Bull shit! Welcome my ass.
I'm not welcome here.
I'm a past memory for her.
