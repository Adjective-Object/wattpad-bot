"No Ash I know how you are." I pant trying to catch up to them.
"Luke I scored a goal!" I see Alex running for the ball that's behind a bush. She got her first goal!
"Yeah keep it up! Okay it's there ball now!"
I see Ash walking to me, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
"So, about that bet. Why?" Im curious now.
"Just a friendly bet. Nothing more, I promise. "
"Okay what's your bet?" Part of me is worried but excited. Mostly anxious I guess. I see his smile turns into a smirk, he's got something I know it.
"If you win, then I'll give you a go at me with the ball. If I win however, I'll take Alex here on a date." He's not serious.
"Seriously?! Why?"
"Like you said, she's just a friend right mate? So she's fair game. C'mon Luke I'll just take her to dinner that's it. Deal?" He said with his hand reached out. I couldn't say yes but I couldn't say no. It's clearly not equal, but he never lets me beat him up. But it's Alex. I see Alex running back with Mikey laughing and poking fun while holding the ball, smiling all happy and proud about the goal. She'll hate me for this.
"Deal. " I shook Astons hand in agreement. What have I done?
