I scream at the door"No need for the profanity." My little sister Cat says, she thinks because she got into S.L.A. she so smart and important. "Yeah, whatever fan girl!" She hates being called that even though that's what she is. I open the door and some Asian kid's standing there well not some kid but some guy around my age."Hi, are you Elizabeth Roberts?" "Yea, who the h-" I'm cut off by my little sister "holy shit, you're Calum fucking Hood" she squeals. She runs to door her blonde hair bouncing behind her. "Again, who the hell are you?" "I'm your brother." He says "holy shit, I guess you're Calum fucking Hood" I say

"Holy shit Calum, she looks just like you." said I guess what was one of Calum's friends"No, she actually looks like Mali." he said again. "Hi, I'm Luke" "Hey Luke I'm Elizabeth but everyone calls me Liz." I say "Like my mum." he smirks "Yea." Cat pipes in "So I guess you like our music." someone else says, he stepped out from behind Luke. "Hello" Cat says "Blush much" I say "who even is this?" I ask pointing at him. He giggles and says "I'm Ashton." "Ohhhhh Cat isn't this the one you're 'IN LOVE' with and don't you want him to father your kids or something." I say just to embarrass her."Shut up" she whispers through her teeth"It's ok" I see Ashton blush "You know she's 14 right? She's just wearing my clothes." his smile fades immediately "Ugh Liz you always do this." she complains "Well you always chase after older guys"
