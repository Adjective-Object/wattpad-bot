"No, no, no, no, no. Roby I am not taking any further step into the obviously weird room." I said taking a step back.
Roby gazed at my eyes, they were softened and kind."Calm down. Everything is going to be alright, I promise."
Roby's words made me follow him. He was the only one who stood by my side for quite a while. Even though it was just a day, I felt like I can trust him with my life. He seemed to be my only consolation until now.We reached to the middle of the room where a man gave us a kind smile and waved.  "Hello, I am Dr.Ali. I am going to make some checking on you. And then I can answer any question you want me to. So, are we good?" Dr.Ali was in his twenties. He was very good-looking. He had  brown hair that was a little bit of dirty blonde. His eyelashes were full and long making his bloody eyes look shadowy.
"Fine" I said gritting on my teeth. He was kind and firm on me while 'checking'.     It was a weird process, I had to open my mouth and have blood taken from me. He also placed a really strange thing into my ear to check my temperature. And then he got a sharp point dug into my arm and drew blood out of it. And then he left silently.
After a while of waiting on the white bed and Roby standing beside me, Dr.Ali entered the small room which was made of glass at the end of the lab. You can see everyone into their work but they always gave me the occasional curious glances.    Dr.Ali sat on the chair facing the bed I was on."Alright Rose, let's see what you are." he said while putting on his spectacles.
After opening the file that was in his hands, he read through it and his eyebrows got together in confusion. Eventually, his eyes went wide open and met mine."Impossible" he muttered under his breath."You are a half-blooded vampire!"
Since the door of the room did not exist everyone in the lab whipped their heads to my direction. Staring with their bloody eyes towards me. Their eyes looked haunting. Even Roby.
