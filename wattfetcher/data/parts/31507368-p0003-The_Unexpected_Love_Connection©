"O-okay. I'll call in and tell them that you're down," he schedules, walking away with the number already dialed. Damn it! Lance comes face forward to me.
"You might have had Johnny fooled but you are not fooling me. What's up man? You have been acting weird lately," he confesses, poking my chest.
"I-It's nothing man. Don't worry about me."
"Oh, I'm not worrying about you, I'm worrying about not meeting Aaliyah because if you don't show up, the photoshoot will be postponed and you will not like my angry side."
"You familiar with her?"
"Hell yeah! She is on my wall bro," Lance responds all hyped up.
"I thought you was gay?"
"But; I am straight for her. Just for her," he says.
"Is that even poss-anyway, look, I'm going to show up and I am totally fine. That's all you need to know," I assure smiling.
"Alright man. I'll catch up with you later."
"Okay Lance, take care."
"You too."
Maybe the photoshoot might not be so bad...as much as I really don't want to go. Then, on the other hand, Lance will kill me. So, I really don't have a choice. The life of Justin Timberlake everyone!
I shut my apartment door and collapse on the couch. The Tv is already on the sports channel. Great, Just in time. I sit up and face the tv in front of me. Not surprisingly, my annoying phone rings. I grab it from my pocket and see who it is--my ex--Britney. I don't even want to talk her right now. So, I press END on my phone and roughly throw it on the table, covering my face afterwards.

The Next Day...
Aaliyah's P. O. V
I sit back in the limo, enjoying the ride. The weather is great. Spring has got to be one of my favorite seasons--despite some of the days when it has moist air. My limo driver stops the vehicle. He looks at me through the mirror.
"We are here, Mrs. Haughton," he charmingly speaks.
One of my bodyguards gets out of the limo and opens the door for me. I step out of the limo with black boots on, a sleeveless shirt, and leather pants. I rarely wear this kind of outfit. The muscular, bald bodyguard to the right of me escorts me to the tall building where most photoshoots are held. I reach up to the top of the stairs and open the door. I spot two boys around my age playing football.
Justin's P.O.V
Lance throws the football back at me and I catch it with one hand. We keep going back and forth until a manager interrupts our playing. I stop and look at all of them as Lance has possession of the football. Hell, he doesn't even notice it.
"Hey boys, I would like to introduce you guys to my niece, Aaliyah. Aaliyah, meet Justin and Lance," her Uncle introduces.
She shakes my hand, "Hey Justin and Lance, nice to meet you. I just want to say that I am a fan of Nsync. You guys have amazing talent and potential."
My whole entire opinion is gone. It just left my body out of nowhere. I feel myself trapped inside her brown eyes. I forget everyone around. Embarrassingly, my hands still shakes hers. She is so damn beautiful!
"H-hey Justin, are you gonna let go now," she stops me out of the gaze. I look down at my hand and quickly disconnect from Aaliyah's. She shakes Lance's hand also but I'm still looking at her like I'm hypnotized are something. Who am I kidding? She's probably not even into boy bands--or white guys for that matter.
