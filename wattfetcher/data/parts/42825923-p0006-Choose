"My dad got a job here." I replied,smiling
"So do you like it here so far?" Nash asked.
"Well California is nice and beautiful but after what just happened with that extreme pervert,no." I replied with a small laugh.
"It'll get better." Nash replied with a comforting smile.
"You're a little quiet." Cameron said turning his gaze to Mayra.
"Sorry." she replied,her cheeks turning a shade of pink. "I just don't know what to say."
"It's cool." Cameron laughed.

"So how many friends have you two made today?" Aiden asked sitting down on my bed.
Mayra and I looked at each other before responding.
"Two?" Mayra replied,making it sound like a question.
"You don't sound so sure." Max said raising an eyebrow.
"Well two guys talked to us at lunch but I don't know if were friends yet." I said.
"How many friends did you two make." Mayra asked looking at Aiden and Max.
"A lot." Max replied with a grin.
"Yeah in fact we got invited to a Bonfire already." Aiden said.
"You two can come with if you want.Its tomorrow at the beach.The one right across from here.Its not far." Max offered.
Tomorrow is Saturday
"Ok.You sure they won't mind?" I asked slightly worried.
"Yeah,its cool." Aiden replied.
"Just wear something nice."-
