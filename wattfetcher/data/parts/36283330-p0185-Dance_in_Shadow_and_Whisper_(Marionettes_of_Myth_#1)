An uncertain pause. "Kali? How did you possibly figure out—isn't this Carmi's phone?"
"It took me about ten minutes. Listen, I...I'm sorry to wake you, but there's something I need to do."
"Oh hell. What is it?"
"Before my dad....Before Lio was sh-shot, um..." I cleared my throat and dredged up some confidence. "He told me that I'd know where to find the answers I need, and I can't just sit here anymore and trade hands until something else catches up to me. I'm going to protect what's mine, and I'm going to take back control. Will you help me do that?"
The silence on the other end plucked at each of my nerves. My eyes squeezed shut and my free hand gripped my knee. I prepared myself for the no.
Again, I should have known better.
"Alright. Where are these answers?"
