He was the bad boy.  You were the good girl.
He was the big bad wolf. You were little red Riding Hood.
Everything you do, he always follows. Everytime you want to be alone, he is always there.
He is flirtatious, flamboyant and annoying. What he is now to you is a bad little boy.
★☆★☆
To him, you were little red riding hood. Pure, kind. Everything he wants. You have it.
You were an angel that ignored him. Which made him inspired to be with you more.
He is the bad boy. You are the good girl. Together, the two of you make a good team.
"Lamb-chan~" He would call out to you. You groaned in frustration as you looked at him. "What?"
A smirk crept into his face. He cupped your chin and leaned close 5 cm apart.
"Where's my birthday present?" He asked.
You shoved him away from you and faced your back at him. "You're a bad boy. You don't deserve a gift from me." You stated.
He gave out a chuckle and walked towards and hugged you from behind. Hot breath tickling your skin. "Well, I am your Bad little boy (Name)."
You faced him with a flustered face and gave him a quick peck on the lips. As you did that, you quickly ran away from him. "THERE! THAT'S YOUR PRESENT!" You shouted.
He chuckled. Man he was lucky to be your bad boy of your life.
