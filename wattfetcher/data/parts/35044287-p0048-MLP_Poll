Not really surprise. Honestly I thought it would of been one of the first ones out but I guess people actually like this song. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this song when the episode first came out... but after like a few times listening to it... it got annoying. Very quickly. Anyway if you voted this song out then you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
SMILE SONG
BBBFF
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
LIFE IN EQUESTRIA
PINKIE'S LAMET
A FRIEND FOR LIFE
Good luck to the nominees!
