Did you even love me. I mean. Really. You're so mean. This is why I don't tell you things. God. Don't cry. Don't fucking cry at my funeral. You're not mourning the loss of a daughter. You aided in this. You helped me die. So you have no right to be upset.
Take care of meatloaf. Don't you dare hurt him or sell him. He was mine.
Thanks for near nothing.
