"Oh."
"Yeah, but who were you talking to? I mean if you want to talk about it?"
I shrugged, "Just my dumb ex."
"I get ya."
I sat down on the couch and Alan sat down next to me, "So what did they want?" Â Alan asked.
"He wanted to get back together."
"Oh, and I'm guessing you didn't want to?"
"Nope, nope I'm never getting with him again."
"Why not?" He asked, "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."
"We fought all the time, and he was basically using me."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I shrugged and leaned back, "It's whatever now."
"Well at least you're not going back to him." He offered smiling a little.
"Yeah I got my sights on someone else."
"Really?" He asked.
"Yeah, yeah I do." I told him biting my lip.
"Well I hope whoever he is makes you happy, but I gotta go, uh, do some camera stuff."
"Alright, have fun with that," I told him as he stood up.
"Uh, yep. Yep I will." He said awkwardly before leaving the back. I smiled watching him leave and got up myself to go hang out with the guys for a while.
"Who was on the phone?" Phil asked when I walked back out.
"Jaxin."
"Oh shit, what did that asshole want?" Tino asked.
"He wanted to get back together... Again."
"Please tell me you said no." He begged.
"I said no."
"Did you mean it when you said no? I mean you've done this before Austin. You say no then you call him back and tell him yes." Aaron said.
"I mean it this time."
"We just don't want you to go through this again."
"I know you don't." I said, "And I promise I'm not going to get back with him, besides- I like someone else now."
"Oh, he doesn't happen to be on this bus does he?"
I shrugged, "You never know."
He rolled his eyes at me.
"What?" I asked.
"Nothing, nothing."
"No, what?"
"We all told you no."
"What do you mean no?" I demanded.
"We know who you're talking about we're not stupid." He said, "We told you no, so stay away."
"Don't worry about it." I said, "Nothing will happen."
"Nothing better happen. We're completely serious about this."
"Nothing will happen, I promise." I said putting a hand on my heart and the other in the air, "Scouts honor."
"Yeah didn't you say that about Jaxin too?" Tino said.
I rolled my eyes, "It's different this time."
