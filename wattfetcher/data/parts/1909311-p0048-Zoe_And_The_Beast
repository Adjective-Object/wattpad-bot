As seconds passed, everyone disappeared. I could faintly see a shadow to my side, but overlooked it, too preoccupied.
“Zoe, get off him,” Someone grabbed my arm and tried to haul me up, away from Beast’s motionless figure. I ignored the person and pulled my arm back, sobbing into Vince’s hair.
“Wake up,” I croaked, tears streaming down my cheeks. “Vince. Please.”
“Zoe, come on!” The hand tried to grasp my shoulder, but I shrugged it off. “Get off of him.”
“No, Zach!” I protested, pressing harder against his wrist. Come on, come on, come on.
“He’s not dead, Zoe! Now come on, the principal will be here any second.”
Thud. Thud. Thud…
I sighed in relief. There it was.
Before I could think any more, I was ripped apart from Beast’s body, dragged across the sidewalk.
“Zach!” I wailed, trying to yank myself free. “Zach, he’s hurt!”
Zach ignored me and continued to pull me away, one hand on his nose, the other dragging me along. He slammed me into two men, a disgusted expression on his face.
“Take her to her room, and make sure she doesn’t leave.” He turned his glare at me. “I’ve got some conversing to do with her.”
My eyes widened as the men shoved me into a car. I sent a fleeting glance back at Beast, his broken body lying still under the beating sun. As if out of luck, Derek ran down to his body, and leaned over it.
“Move it,” someone nagged, shutting the tinted door.
Oh, God.

AN:
I think this was very rushed and really, really awful. I guess I was in a rushed mood? Eh, I don't really know; I didn't get a chance to proof read this chapter. The next chapter will be much better - I promise! I'll update the next chapter by the end of the week!
If you can, check out the AMAZING picture someone made for Vince on the side!
