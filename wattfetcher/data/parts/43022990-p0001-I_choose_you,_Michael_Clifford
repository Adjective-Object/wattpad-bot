-Intro-Hi, I'm Emma. I was a little cancer child and I rocked it! My bald head shining bright like a diamond, I couldn't be happier. I never really knew what was going on until I turned 19, then I felt the tole on my body, fatigue, nausea, excessive vomiting, me being in an uncomfortable hospital bed all day, knowing the fact that I was going to die...that scared me the most. But, I don't want my story to be just a sad soap opera that ends with everyone dead, I want to tell you how it happened. With me, my family, a globe, and Michael Clifford.
