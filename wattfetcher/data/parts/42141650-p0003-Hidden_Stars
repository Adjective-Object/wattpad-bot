The bus ride was a terror. My pink hair was peeking out of my hood and no matter how many times I tried to stuff it under it kept popping out. Today was gonna be terrible.
Aiden's POV
The bus ride was so boring. Greta and Elliot decided to sit all the way in the back so now I don't have anyone to talk to.
Finally the bus had stopped at school. I rushed to my locker and opened it and closed it as fast as possible.
I set off to my class using the map trying to find the way to math. I was a senior. I arrived and everyone was chatting nonstop. Math was not my best subject honestly and I never liked it anyway.
I sat behind this girl with jet black hair with purple streaks. She turned around and looked me up and down. She had piercings all up both her ears, her nose, and snake bites. Her eyes were bright blue.
"Hi. I'm Aurora. And no. before you say it I'm not a freakin princess." She said.I stammered "I-I didn't think that at all." she smirked and replied "Good." Than turned back around.
I've never talked to someone that long. Especially a girl! Maybe she wants to be my friend. No who am I kidding she won't like me. Not at all.
And with that class had started.
