I gave him one last hug and wiped away a teqr coming down from my face. I turned around to face Sinbad who was crying furiously. I giggled and gave him a hug.
"Your coming back right?" He mumble into my long loose black hair that almost reach the floor.
"Yeah" I smiled and wiped his tears. He laughed and hugged me back.
"We must go. Judal is a pain in the ass,and we won't want to keep him waiting. I nod and take off my magic turban that rested on my hips, I hopped on in and flew outside. The cold harsh air send shivers down my back and I faced who I think is Judal
"You must be Judal?" I asked arching my eye brow. He nodded and smirked. Judal appears as a young man with a slender muscular build and average height. Judar has medium long black hair with a long segmented pony-tail that stretches down to his ankles and red, ringed eyes. He wears purple makeup on his eyes that fades towards the inner portion of his eyelids. Judar wears an Indian chunnari around his neck with a small, short sleeved black choli which reveals his midriff under it, which is where he keeps his MagicWand. He wears an Indian leg dress, that stops at his ankles, with no shoes. He wears golden bangled bracelets that extend from his elbows to his wrists and a golden bangled necklace with a ruby in the center that are inspired by Rajasthani folk dancers.
"Then I guess we are done here?" I smirked and flew over to his side placing my hands on his waist. He froze but slowly went with the flow.
"Goodbye Sinbad, and all you other people I could less about " I yelled over Judal shoulder and kissed Judal cheek.
"Shall we go?" He nodded and lead the way.
