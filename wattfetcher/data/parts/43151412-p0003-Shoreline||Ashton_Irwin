"They seem cool, but I know this is random but do you play any instruments?" I ask the question had been stuck in my head all day.
"Yeah I do, I play the drums." He smiles proudly, I guessed that was it by the way he examined out drum set we had out for others to gawk at when they came into the shop. "Do you, have any instruments that you play?"
I laugh nervously "well, I used to play the clarinet from 6th grade until 12th." I tell him he smiles widely when I tell him that.
"Let me guess, were you in marching band?"
"Ugh, yes my mom kinda forced me to in it but it was fun." I smile back to my memories of marching band in high school.
After awhile it was time to lock up the shop, I showed Ashton how to and after that it was time to return home. I knew my mom wouldn't be there, I start walking down the street to my house but Ashton's voice stops me.
"Hey! Do you wanna walk together, I think we live on the same street." He says I nod my head as he catches up to me and we walk down the street. The sun was very close to setting causing the sky to be pretty colors. We approached my house very quickly since Greenlight wasn't a very far walk from where we lived.
"I'll see you tomorrow at work I guess, bye Ashton." I smile and wave to him walking up the steps of my porch.
"You'll see me tomorrow, I mean if you want to, but you down have to do you wanna walk to work together tomorrow?" He asks nervously I nod my head "okay, well don't be too crazy tonight." He jokes
"Yeah, Netflix and I go crazy once we get together." I joke and we both laugh even though it was a horrible joke. I wave awkwardly and open the door.
"Should I expect to see you at the shoreline tonight?" He asks backing up slightly
I ponder on his question then give him a answer "most likely." I smile stepping inside closing the door behind me kicking off my shoes.
