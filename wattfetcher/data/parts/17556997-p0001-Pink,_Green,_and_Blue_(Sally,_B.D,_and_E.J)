I guess you could say that having killers to protect you could be pretty awesome, but if you met the killers that I've been guarded with, then you would probably regret saying that. Just like any other story, it all started at a day of school. Me and my best friends, Natalie and Steven, were sitting in class, waiting for the bell to ring so we could go home. When everyone else in class were in their own little groups, we were in our own little group. We were all eating starburst while talking about random stuff at our desk.
"No Steven! The pink ones are the best ones!" Natalie argued to Steven as she held out some pieces of pink starburst.
"No way! The orange ones are better!" Steven said as he held out some pieces of orange starburst.
Natalie gave Steven a "You disgust me!" look. "You're argument is invalid!" Natalie randomly stated as she unwrapped a pink piece of starburst and popped it in her mouth.
I giggled at her statement as I ate the red pieces of starburst. Natalie looked over at me and smirked.
"Jessica! Which ones are the best? The pink starburst or the orange?"
I looked over at Steven then at Natalie. "I personally think the red ones are better, but if I would have to choose between those two, it's no contest that the pink ones win!" I said with a smile as I continued to eat the red pieces of starburst.
Natalie looked over at Steven, with a pleasing look. "Told ya!" she said in sweet victory.
Steven rolled his eyes and continued eating the orange pieces.
I know that you're probably wondering why we're eating candy in class, but it's okay. Our teacher let us for 2 reasons. 1, it was the last class of the day and it was almost time to go home. And 2, we were the good kids of the class while the rest were just delinquents.
I don't know about Natalie though, but never mind that.
As I went onto my phone, Steven glanced over at the clock then back at us.
"So, what are you girls doing this weekend?" he asked as he took his share of starburst and placed them in the pocket of his blue jeans.
"Nothing really....." Natalie answered as she took her share of starburst and placed it in the side pocket of her backpack.
"Me too....." I said as I took my share of starburst and placed it in the side pocket of my purse.
As I opened my purse to put my cellphone back, I glanced over at my knife. Ever since Jane moved in with me, Jeff, and Slender, I carried around that knife all the time ever since. I don't like the idea of using the knife to kill people, but since Jeff got me that knife for my 13th birthday, I decided that I'll only use it for protection, defense, or any other emergencies.
Making sure that nobody was looking at me, I quickly closed my purse so that nobody would see that I brought a knife with me to school. I always brought that knife with me to school and I still do now. The only person that knew I had aÂ knife was Natalie. She knows my family are killers, but for some odd reason, she's okay with it. She didn't question it, she didn't freak out, and she didn't tell anyone else about them. She stayed calm, cool, and collected. I questioned how she was able to do that, but hey! That's Natalie for ya!
Steven doesn't know about my family, though. I never had the courage to tell him. I was worried that he might have had a different reaction from Natalie's. Despite the blonde hair and the fact that he's taller than me, Steven is a wimp and was always getting picked on. And of course I would be the one to stand up for him. Since he was a wimp, I was worried he would freak or something.
Not only that, but Steven had a crush on me and still does. I've always known he had a crush on me. If I showed my family to him and tell him that they are killers, it would probably effect the affections that he has for me. I don't know if I like him back or not, but I wouldn't want to ruin feelings that he has for me. Since I live in a forest and was home schooled throughout my life, I never had a boyfriend or feelings for a boy before. So when I found out that he had a crush on me, I didn't think anything of it. Although I was a bit flattered.
