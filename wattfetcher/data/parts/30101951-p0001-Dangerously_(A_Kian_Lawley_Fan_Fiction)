Hey, my names Julia, but people call me Juls. I'm 16 and I live in a small town in northern califor- wait hold on, here comes the one & only badass at our school, Kian Lawley ugh. Don't mind him ugh.
Juls never expected what's about to happen to her with Kian Lawley, the total badass at her school that makes people hide when he walks by. He came into her life with a secret, a plan. What could it be?
AHHHHHH GET EXCITED PEOPLE
