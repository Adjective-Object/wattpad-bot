"So That Also Means, Nothing Of That Was Real..Just Some Ha- Bad Things Your Brain Had Processed, Am I Right ?"
"No." She Replied Monotnously.
Tilting her Head Slightly, To Stare back At him From Where He Was sitting Next to Her on A Chair, She Muttered,
"It Was Too Real To Be False."
She Tilted Her Head Back, Resting Her Head Head On The Comfortable Lounge As Her Eyes Calculated Every Passing Second On The Clock That Never Seemed To Stop Ticking.
She Knew The Doctor Was Trying So Hard To Make Conversation With Him And Apparently, He Was Failing Miserably.
It Annoyed Him How Her Answers Seemed So Vague But She, However, Seemed To Like It.
Humming In Response, He Scribbled Something Down On His Notepad Before Shooting Another Question At Her.
"Did You Hear Any..Voices That Night ?" He Asked Skeptically, Observing Her Every Movement.
This Question, However, Seemed To Annoy Brianna A Little.
Her Mind Mentally Flashed Her Back To Memories. She Gazed At The Clock In A Daze, Her Mind Distancing her Away From The Present.
"Daddy ?" I Said Quietly.
"Yes, Sweatheart ? Dont Worry, Im On My Way." He Answered Reassuringly.
"I-I Think He's Gone." I Whispered Lowly Through The Reciever.
"Miss Vadore ?"
"Wh-"
Sadly, I Was Proven Wrong.
Three Light Knocks Sounded At My Door Rather Than My Window.
"Open Up Bree." A Husky Voice Whispered Beside my Ear.
For A Split Second, I Stopped Breathing, My Heart Nearly Skipped A Beat And My Mouth Was Miraculously Sealed Shut.
"Brianna ?"
"Open Up" the Voice Whispered Again. Although The Door Should've muffled the Sound, It Seemed So Clear..Like The Person Was Whispering It Right In My Ear.
Cold Chills Seeped through My Bones And My Body Seemed Numb To Register anything.
Pounding Fists Pounded Against My Bathroom Door Suddenly Making Me Release An Involountary Screa-
"Bree ?" Her Nickname Snapped Her Out Of Her Daze.
"Dont Call Me That !" She snapped At The Doctor Venomously.
He Seemed Taken back By Her Sudden Reaction But Shook It Off nonetheless.
"Are you Sure ?" He asked, Concern lacing his tone.
"Yes." She retorted, a blank look on her face.
"So, You Didnt Answer My Qu-"
"No." She cut him off Vaguely, " I Didnt."
He Didnt Seem To Want to Push The Matter Further As He Noticed My Expression.
"Okay Brianna, Who Do You Think This Person Was ? Do you Think It Was Justin ?"
"No.." She Whispered, A Frown Appearing On Her Eye brows As A Look Of Pain Crossed Her Features.
"No..Justin Wouldnt Do t-this." She Whispered lowly, Stammering At The End.
