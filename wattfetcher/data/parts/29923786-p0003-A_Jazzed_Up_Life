Let me see you danceI love to watch you danceTake you down another level Get you dancing with the devilTake a shot of thisBut I'm warning youI'm on that shit that you can't smell babySo put down your perfume
Bring your love baby I could bring my shameBring the drugs baby I could bring my painI got my heart right hereI got my scars right hereBring the cups baby I could bring the drinkBring your body baby I could bring you fameAnd that's my motherfucking words tooSo let me motherfucking love you
Listen boy I'll give you all I gotGet me off of thisI need confidence in myselfListen boy I'll give you all of meGive me all of itI need all of it to myself
So tell me you love meOnly for tonightOnly for one nightEven though you don't love meJust tell me you love meI'll give you what I needI'll give you all of meEven though you don't love me"
The song ended and the next played. No Love by August Alsina. She turned to Huey who was already looking at her. "You want to go back inside?" She asked. He shook his head 'no'. She nodded, "okay, do you want to pick a song is this time?"
"No." He simply responded. She nodded once again. She sang along to the song. Huey's wine colored eyes watched the light skinned girl. He traced her pretty, pink, strawberry scented lips. She noticed. She loves it when the afro boy stares at her. His beautiful eyes glued to her only and nothing else. Then something in her mind clicked. She smirked.
"Huey, sing for me." She said smiling at his sudden scowl. "Come on Huey please." He continued to scowl.
"I don't sing, Jazmine." His voice was hard. She pouted and started to rock him back and forth.
"Please, Huey please! I always sing for you!"
"No." Jazmine pretended to be pissed.
"Fine then I will never sing for you again." His right eye twitched. He began thinking of excuses."
"Damn it Jazmine, singing is your thing. I don't sing." He quickly responded.
"So, I'm your girl-friend you should sing for me anyway. I don't sing for anybody but you, Cindy and mr Freeman, not even my own dad." She shot back quickly, internally smirking. Huey groaned.
"Alright, I will sing for you, but not today. I will save it for a day you will really need it, okay?" She thought about his words. She then smiled and nodded in agreement.
"Okay, but I will hold this against you." She kissed his cheek. She knows he hated those. They are half-ass kisses. He used his thumb and turned her face towards his. He gently placed a soft kiss on her lips. She smiled into it and pressed harder.
Their short make-out was interrupted by C-Murph aka Cindy. She was knocking on the car window. "Hey, kissy kissy time is over, let me in." The two broke apart and Huey got out.
"Bye Huey!" She said. He nodded back and began walking back into the building. Cindy replaced him in the seat. Jazmine watched her boyfriend walk back into the building his ands in his pocket his face expressionless. Jazmine bit her lip as she watched him, her eyes focused on one particular part of the teen.
"Jazzy, are you look'n at da nigga's ass?" Jazmine looked at her friend and shook her head.
"No." She denied a little to quickly. Cindy laughed at her friend.
