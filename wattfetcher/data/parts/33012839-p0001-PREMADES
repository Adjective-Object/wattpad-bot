| Rules |
- story must be posted (no exceptions this time i'm sorry :( Â )
- i'll pick who gets cover if i think it goes with story
- i don't really like when people put "thanks" at the end of forms because i don't know, it feels like they are ignorant or they already know the cover/pre-made will be given to them.
- if title is too long, depending on pre-made, i won't accept it
- if form is not accept i will delete comment so if yours is not there any more, that is why
- please use just my form
IF YOU WANT THE COVER COMMENT THE FORM - DON'T ASK FOR IT - JUST COMMENT THE FORM
| Form |
Title//
Author (no usernames)//
Summary//
Relation// (between cover and story)

i really hope this one goes well >_<
