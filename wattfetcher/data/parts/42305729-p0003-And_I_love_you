So here we are. I look at you and I don't reconize you.
You saw me in the street that day but for surprise we didn't talk.
I would like to tell to you all my feelings but that's imposible. If i just try to say what is in my mind would be awful and would scare you.
I want to stop this feeling beacuse every time I look at your eyes or something, my heart beats so quickly that scares me.
But in the other hand I asked myself what i look to you, I mean you are nothing for the world, but when you are with me there is something that I don't know maybe could be lovely or don't.
But what I really like, and anybody in the whole world could change, is your perfume and when you sing cute songs and look me into my eyes.
You inspire me to write.
So this are my feelings today and maybe tomorrow, and I don't know until when but what I really know is that is happening.
This is all for today good friend, I know you'll never read this but makes me feel alive.
Pd: I really really like you.
