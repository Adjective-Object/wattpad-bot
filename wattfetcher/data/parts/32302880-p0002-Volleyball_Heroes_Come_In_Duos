Kageyama started up the stairs to the gym when he noticed something peculiar...a cat. He didn't do well with cats, or animals, or basically anything that was alive. As Kageyama hesitantly put out his hand to the small creature a boy who, to be honest, quite resembled a cat himself, bounced up to him. "A cat!" Hinata shouted with a goofy grin on his face. "It's black...like you." A smile slowly crept up his cheeks radiating throughout his entire self. "Wha-what," Kageyama was confused and puzzled at this thought, "why does it look like me?" Hinata turned to face him a slight blush on his cheeks. "You're both so...I don't know...lonely," his eyes seemed almost brimming with tears "and I'm here but not making it any better." This startled Kageyama and thought back to when this could've been instigated. Then it hit him. The practice match with Aoba Josai, where Oikawa tormented with memories of junior high. Kageyama had always be alone and at nationals it was only proven more so. "...idiot..." He murmured under his breath, "I'm not anything like I was back then." Hinata let loose salty tears flowing like a broken dam. "Shut up, I hate you!" Hinata tried to desperately make some sort of retort but it seemed like denial. Seeing Hinata sink to the ground Kageyama lowered himself to the stairs beside him. "Can I be your first friend?" Hinata yells out between sobs. "You already are..." Kageyama proclaims ruffling the smaller boys fluffy orange hair and smiles warmly with a smile never seen before.
(The rest of the volleyball team is heart warmed at this event all except Tsukki who only had one word for this rare occurrence........."homos."
