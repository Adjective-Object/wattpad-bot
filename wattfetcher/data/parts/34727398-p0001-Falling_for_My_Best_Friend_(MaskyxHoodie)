I walk through the woods, the leaves crunching beneath my feet. I look up and see the sun peeking out between the trees.
"It's such a beautiful day." I whisper to myself.
"Yes it is, isn't it?" A familiar voice asks. I jump and whip my head behind me and see Masky standing there. He tilts his head slightly and laughs.
"Did I scare you?" He asks after he has regained his composure. I feel the blood rushing to my face.
"N-no...I was just su-suprised." I stutter.
Damn it Hoodie!
Masky just shakes his head.
"Whatever you say dude. Can I walk with you?" He asks. I growl quietly.
"It's a little late for that!" I snap. His eyes go wide for a split second, then chuckles.
"What's so funny?" I snap and glared at him, waiting for an answer.
"Geez Hoodie, who pissed in your Cheerios this morning?" He asks, tilting his head in confusion. I roll my eyes and sigh, frustrated. I turn back around and start walking away.
"Hey! Wait for me!" He shouts. I hear the leaves crunching under his feet as he walks quickly to catch up to me. Not like I went too far, but I've been known to walk quite fast. I felt a hand on my shoulder and I growl. I spin around and rip off my mask so he could see my face.
"Hoodie, why are you getting so worked up?" He asks. He slowly takes off his mask. I don't know why he did that.
Probably to make me feel guilty about yelling at him...
I glare at him, looking into his piercing blue eyes. He stares right back, but with confusion reflecting in his eyes.
"Hoodie? Why are you so grumpy today?" I sigh and look down and my shoes.
"...you scared me." I mumble.
"What?"
"I said you scared me!" I shout. I look up and see his lips curled into a smirk.
"I knew I scared you." Masky says.
"Shut up." This earned a laugh from him, making the corners of my mouth curl into a small smile. I stared at him and noticed how his face glows with joy and how every once in awhile, wisps of his hair would brush against his forehead.
He looks so...happy? Adorable? Wait, not adorable. Maybe adorable? He sorta looks cute....but I'm not gay so I guess he looks-
"Uhh, Hoodie?" Masky asks, his voice gushing concern. This snapped me out of my thoughts.
"Hm?"
"You were kinda zoning out there. I thought you finally lost it." He says. I raise my eyebrows in confusion.
"I was?"
"Yes you were. Anyways, how about we go back to the mansion before you completely lose it." He says, laughing. I punch his arm.
"Ow!" He yelps. I roll my eyes playfully and start to head towards the mansion.~~~~~~~~~~~~I feel someone shaking me. I close my eyes tighter and curl into my blanket even more.
"Wanna go on a killing spree? Huh, huh?" A voice says. I flip over so I am facing the speaker. I open my eyes and see Ben standing there, grinning.
"What time is it?" I say sleepily.
"It's 2:18 in the morning."
"Why the hell did you wake me up this damn early?" I grumble.
"Because I wanna go kill some people and nobody wants to come with me. So wanna go with me?" He asks. I shut my eyes.
"No. I wanna go back to sleep." I say, rolling over so I face the wall again.
"Come on! Don't be lazy! Get up and lets go!" He whines. I sigh, open my eyes and pull myself out of bed. I grab my mask and pocketknife from the bedside table. Ben jumps up and down like a child. I roll my eyes.
He's such a pain in the ass.~~~~~~~~~~A/NSo what do you guys think so far? Sorry if anything isn't accurate, I'm doing the best I can though. Anyways, until next time,
BYEEE
