One day it finally hit me, I was not as fine as I told myself I was. I needed my mom, I wanted my dad, the void they made was never filled I covered it up.
I've filled it in other ways. She owes me the mother she never was, he owes me the father I never had, they owe me the childhood they stole from me.
These debts will never be paid, I won't be at her funeral, I don't respond to his calls.
I've moved on, I do what pleases me now. Everyone is gone, I'm all I have left.
I'll drink all you have, smoke you broke, fuck you senseless and go home.
They can't stop me now.
