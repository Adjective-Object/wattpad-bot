Chapter 1
*Angelique O'Neil's POV*
As I walked down the corridor I heard running. I turned around as I saw the person who is running. He was calling out my name as well as breaking my rules. He was also dragging in dirt. I'll have to get the janitor to take care of that.
"Mrs. O'Neil! General Esperon and Leon told me to..." He was calling out, but he stopped running when he saw that I was giving him the eye. He cleared his throat and started to walk towards me. "Mrs. O'Neil. General Esperon and Leon told me to come and give you this. They said to tell you that they would like to talk to you privately."
"Why is it every time you have to tell me something you run and disregard my rules? Cain. You and those generals don't ever consider the rules that I put up, I will reinforce them harshly." I concluded with the narrowing of my eyes.
He gulped saying, "I'll tell the Generals that you would like them to come in scheduled then. I'll also tell them that you would like to meet them at 4 then." He said about to turn around.
"No, I will meet with them now." I responded turning around.
"Now?"
"Now." I repeated.
I walked off to my office as I read the file he had in the brief case. He was muttering some things. I rolled my eyes as I continued to read it. Interesting.
"This file is quite interesting. Also, what do you not get about the word SPY?" I asked him.
I knew he wasn't going to answer me at all. I did know that I already know who will be on the watch for her. He has the best technique, he goes to the same school as her and she probably knows and likes my son.
I took my phone out of my pocket and dialed his number. He picked his phone up like he knew I was going to call him.
"Hey, Mom. What is it?" He asked.
"Hi Chase. I think you might have a case. Come to the agency straight to my office."
"Alright Mom. See you in a second." He said hanging up.
I shut my phone. I arrived to my office and within a few seconds. Also no I didn't just pick my son because he's my son. He is the top spy and he's been waiting for a case for two months.
"The Generals will be here in a few minutes. Next time make sure I didn't know you woke up earlier than me to get to headquarters, but I love that you thought I didn't know that son." I said as I went to my desk to sit.
"Why don't you think I am just faster than you?" He asked crossing his arms putting his hands behind his head with a silly smirk on his face.
"Do you want a case or not?" I asked him still reading her file.
As I got to her parents I read what she had to go through making me frown.
