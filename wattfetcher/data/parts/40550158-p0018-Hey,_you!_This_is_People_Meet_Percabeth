"Annabeth Chase, you are my soulmate," at the words Percy said Annabeth started to cry even harder.
"And I know we are complete opposites, and shouldn't be in love because of who we are, but squids- tentacles, I've love you more than I love blue cookies. That's saying a lot! Anyways, I know Im not the smartest, or the richest, and I don't know why you put up with me, but I'm glad you do. 'Cause the only thing I'm 100% certain about, is that I want to be with you for the rest of my life. Annabeth Chase, will you make me the happiest man alive and become my wife?"
"Yes! Oh of course Percy, yes!" She screamed jumping on him and crying hard as he slipped the ring onto her finger. Everyone cheered. This might be the best day of my life.
After the party and all the tears had stopped, I caught Percabeth walking towards the beach.
"You guys Congrats!," I shout racing up to them . I gave them both a hug and then turned towards Annabeth.
"I was wondering...could I attend your wedding?"
"You can do more than that. How would you like to be my second maid of Honor, Thalia being the first?"
"Are you Sirius!" I screamed
They both smiled.
