Lilith was leaning against the wall by the window, watching the life go by in the rain. We put on fake smiled and she looked up at us, also smiling. "You guys sure took awhile. Did you take care of that sexual tension?" She teased, wiggling her eyebrows just like Ashton did. "Shut up" I giggled.
No, holy fuck, did I just giggle?
Lilith held up the movie and said; "Ready to go?" She still sounded cold, her teeth shattering. "Yeah, about that, Ashton is gonna join us, if that's OK." I said, and every word kinda hurt. I wanted to be alone with her... not in the way you think, jeez.
I swear I could see disappointment behind the surprised mask she was wearing. "Of course, the more the better" She smiled. Ashton nodded, smiling back at her. "Awesome" Since there's no-one left here, I'll pack up right away and we'll leave. We can bring the blanket, I have a car." He said/explained. "Great! A car! No more rain!" Lilith cheered, doing a little "victory dance", jumping around happily.Â Almost making me forget what she maybe is.
