Hi! 3D is being a grumpy know-it-all so I'm taking over. Is it bad that I want people to spam me? I really want to know. I mean, I enjoy going through notifications unless they're hater comments, which hasn't happened yet. I actually get kind of sad when I don't have any. So, can you guys answer my question in the comments below? Arigatou, grazie, gracias, thank you.
