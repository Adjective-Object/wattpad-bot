Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos had to get up from their creaky, ripped, makeshift and real beds, and travel to the Isle's central market area for Maleficent's new announcement for them. And with lots of groans, moans, and words of irritation, the fantastic four circled around the Isle's wickedly evil ruler, Maleficent the great.
Maleficent approached the wicked teens, raised her arms, and grinned at the annoyed children. "Welcome, welcome, welcome. Before you leave this afternoon, I have an announcement from Prince Ben, regarding the proclamation he made a couple days ago."
Mal frowned in impatience. What now? Is she gonna be forced to frolick with the princesses? Wear a pink sparkly dress and heels as her uniform? Or, worst of all, join some stupid club?
Maleficent's grin grew wider as she said, "There will be one more little villain with you all. Her name is Alexia Hook, Captain Hook's wicked daughter. I hope you include her in the dastardly plan I set for you all. She has a lot to offer as a villain in training, and I hope you all see her as a promising mini- villain. She will be here shortly to greet you four, and to get further instructions from me and her father. I will be waiting right here, and so will you, so don't you even think about trying to escape."

"I heard she has minions at her control to try and steal Maleficent's magic staff." Evie added.
"I heard she cursed a group of first years with the magic pendant she stole from the Evil Queen." Carlos shuddered.
"Well, I haven't heard nothing from her." Jay said. "And I don't trust her at all.
