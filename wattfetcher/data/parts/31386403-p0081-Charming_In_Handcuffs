Jack made the gesture with his hand to continue, "Who's Lily?"
"Juliet, we talked about this—"
"I know. And I'm not asking questions about what you did. I'm just asking about the person that made Paxton want to bite your head off."
His eyes softened and he let out a long sigh, "Lily was Paxton's girlfriend. I feel like calling her his girlfriend is an understatement."
"Was?" I swallowed.
Jack bobbed his head, "She was murdered last year. Tore Paxton apart."
I didn't know what Lily had to do with them, but it must have been serious. I felt kind of bad for asking. I didn't know how close Jack was with her, so I hope I didn't bring up any memories. "That's horrible." I mumbled.
"There's something else I think you should know also." Jack said.
This wasn't expected. Jack actually willing to tell me information was like a treat. I didn't have to pull for this one. "What?"
"Paxton...he's not really my cousin."

This was one of those chapters I couldn't stop writing once I started, hahaha.
Any theories on who this person could be?
It's gonna get crazy, that is all. :)))))

Hope you liked the chapter!
