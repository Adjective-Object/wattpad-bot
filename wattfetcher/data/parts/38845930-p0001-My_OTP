Erin's POV
I woke up to a phone call. Jordan, Chad, Steve and I did a competition in minecraft and I lost them so I had a pie to the face and had to drink ranch dressing soda. "Y'all get your fixin's" said Chad after I answered the phone.
--only people who watched the video would get that--
"What do you want Chad?" I asked
"What's wrong with you, Erin?"
"Nothing. whats up?"
"The competition with Jordan and Steve got so Many likes, we decided to do another, but we wanted to see if you wanted to do it to before just saying hey we are doing another."
"Sure, i'll do it." I shouted in excitement and partial fear.
I went onto the minecraft game we were going to play and I got 3rd place out of the four, so now Jordan is the loser in this. he has to eat meal worms and crickets. I'd say it went pretty well for me compared to the last one.
The two others we played were won by Chad and Steve, me and Jordan got 3rd and 4th place so he has meal worms, crickets and I the grossest combination of food Chad can think of.
TORTURE!
Jordan's POV
I have to eat meal worms today, not very fun.
Erin is eating the grossest combination of food chad can think of.
