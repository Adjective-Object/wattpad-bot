My awakening was something I knew was coming. I knew I wasn't a human inside. I knew I was different. That starts when I was 10. I am a military brat, so I've moved a lot. The place I was stationed when I was ten was Misawa AB in northern Japan. There are no Therians there. All I knew were the Japanese legends and the things I saw on the Internet or TV. Due to my different behavior, I did research. But, I went to the wrong subject.
I thought I was a werewolf for the longest time. That was until I got back to the states two months ago. (March 14 2015) I was awakened the very moment I found out what a Therian was. I had a weird jolt of emotion, for I read about someone who was a wolf Therian. It felt like I was finally complete in life. It was the best feeling I've ever had. It made me happy, excited, playful, even horny... I knew something was different about me, and I found what that was. I began dreaming after that. Dreaming of my wolf. She was strong, fast, intelligent, but a lone wolf. I still don't know her name today, but I call her Lycan. A stereotypical name, I know, but it is rather beautiful in my eyes. But, until I find her real name, I will refer to her as Lycan. Anyway, all I know about her is her personality and her fur. She is a basic Timber Wolf. Light brown fur with grey and dark brown accents. The picture at the beginning is my Lycan. It isn't her of course, but the picture resembles her. I love her very much. She helps me pull through the difficulties of life. Anyway, please stick through me as I write my Therian journey out for you. Also, message me if you want to talk. If you have kik, there is a group called #Theriansoftheus. A very nice group of people are in that group. They've helped me out a lot. So, here I go :3 welcome to story of me, Brianna.
