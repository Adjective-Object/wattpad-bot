I open my eyes and I'm faced with reality again. My surroundings tell me I'm in a hospital. Harry is in the corner speaking with a police officer. I close my eyes and try to listen just incase.
"So, Mr. Styles, describe exactly what you believe happened," the officer speaks and clicks his pen to write vital information.
"My girlfriend and I got into an argument. She stormed out and I followed her into the city. Once I finally caught up to her, I was too late. Brock kidnapped her when she ran into an alleyway to hide from me. That's when I went to the warehouse and found him.. raping her," Harry frowns. What? Girlfriend?
"So your girlfriend, her name is Lennon, correct?" The officer checks to make sure. Why is he saying that?
"Yes," he confirms.
"And Brock is your dad?"
"Step father," he corrects him. I feel like I'm about to be sick. What the hell? I hope this isn't true either. If it is, I don't know what I'm going to do. It sickens me that he would hide something like that. He could be playing me for all I know.
"That's all I need for now, Mr. Styles! I will be back later on to have some background on your step father. Thank you for your time," the officer says and leaves the room.
"What the hell was that Harry? I'm your girlfriend now? Brock is your fucking step father?" I ask.
"Oh, you're awake.." he looks away.
"Answer my damn questions," I almost shout. I'm beyond pissed at him. I don't care if he rescued me. He lied.
"The only reason I called you my girlfriend is because it's easy than saying friend, I mean, we hate each other half the time. I didn't know what else to say," he bits his lip.
"Why did you lie to me? About Brock?" I huff.
"Look, I.. It's a long story," he sighs.
"Pretty sure I have time," I roll my eyes. He's not getting out of this. Harry takes a seat in the chair next to my hospital bed.
"So, a few years ago, I remember seeing this beautiful girl lying on the sidewalk of New York City. She had gorgeous blonde hair and amazing eyes I would love to look into all day long. I told my step father, Brock, all about her. I would watch her everyday, look at her every move. She was a sight, but the only thing wrong was that she was homeless. I asked my step father if he would help her. So, one day, he talked to her and managed to bring her into his business. I thought he was helping her, but really, he was helping him self.. selfish bastard. Anyway, after she worked for him for quite awhile, I saw she was still homeless. My father barely paid her. He was the one who earned most of the cash. She was risking her life, putting her body out there for men to buy just to please themselves. I got tired of seeing her not be successful. Brock wouldn't let her leave his business. I could tell she was sad and ready to stop. The greedy son of a bitch wouldn't let her go. Finally, she got out of it though she was still living on the filthy streets of NYC. So, one day, I formed an idea. I would help her myself, except I was too much of a coward to do it. I asked my friend, Niall, to give her food and drink everyday. One time, I even saved her from my own step father. I felt heroic, but still too shy to show my true identity. Later on, I asked my friends to bring her to our place to stay and have a home. Since the moment she stepped through that door, I became nervous. I was so damn nervous that I treated her like shit. I called her names and acted like she was worthless. Though, deep inside, I loved her. She just couldn't see it because I didn't show it," he says.
I don't know what to think or say. I'm not sure if I'm still mad or if I'm touched. Do I like him like that? Am I too much of a coward to admit it too?
