Edit: Skye is dirty, yes I know. IS he had a... Wrestling match with Steve? IDK.
I know I already posted something in meh book of Randomness... Just, deal with it. So. This is an introduction picture. Umm... not that many of you know who Skye is, (especially if you haven't read EoE and/or SB) so if you dare or ask her a question you may get to know her more! I draw out the dares/ questions, some are sketched, some may be detailed, and some maybe just black and white with shadings, depending on how lazy I'm.but, you'll be able to read it clearly. I'm also working on The Offical ( You may still Join) Team Ender. (So far, of who's all in it) Here's who I remember... (stupid ADD)-MCgirl123-sam-the-minecrafter-KandyQueen16-MCGirlGamer-Shadow_EnderMC-MsMiseryMc
