"Are you crazy ? What the hell do you think you're doing? Is that how you tell them about Islam?"
"No, that's how they tell me how to enjoy life !"
"Leena ! Stop this, you're going to regret it. That's not you ! What happened ?" Tom asked angrily.
"Ready to go babe?" Jake hugged me from behind and I nodded leaving Tom alone with no answer, I walked hand in hand with Jake and stepped closer to him when I saw Simon, his eyes were filled with envy, anger and hate.
"So, you're coming to my house tonight, aren't you?" Jake asked, I understood what he meant in the hidden lines, I didn't want to, I wanted to refuse, I looked at Simon who was shaking his head hoping thag I'd reject, but, I want to give him a taste ofÂ  what I felt when he dumped me.
"Yeah sure, at 8" I smiled, Jake kissed me then headed to his class, I saw Simon walking toward me so I ran to my class.
.......
I didn't visit Jake, I wasn't stupid enough to get fooled by him, I knew he didn't love anything except my look and body. It hurt me like hell, being forced to kiss him and get along with his stupid and rude friends just to hurt Simon back. But I was also sure that it was more painfull for Simon than it was for me ... But, what if he didn't care? What if he did actually stop loving or caring about me ? Then, I'd just be hurting myself.
Many people started giving me advices, but nobody cared as much as Tom did, he tried his best to convince me to get back the way I was, he got punched many times buy Jake for annoying me and got hut by Connor for stopping in our way ... In the other hand, there was Damon, who only spoke to me with his eyes, sometimes he showed fear, regret, worry and anger but his mouth never said a word.
I kissed Jake every time I saw Simon, even though I was sure that he might have gotten over me.
It's love that hurts us the most and changes us.
Who could ever expect that the religious Leena would ever become this low ?
.....
A week later ...
I still had not seen Molly, I started getting kind of worried, I wanted to ask Simon about her but I didn't, I wasn't ready to hear his voice or look into his gorgeous eyes, I didn't want to fall in his arms again and cry, because I was sure that he stopped caring at all. He stopped giving me the worry and disgust look, he stopped even looking ...
And there I was, hurting myself, I was slowly killing myself, a day after day, I lost a part of my sole, until I became empty ... 100% empty. No feelings at all.
I looked like a lifeless bird, goodlooking, and colourful but dead inside.
What's next ?
"LEENA !" I jumped, "What? Who? Why?" Jake woke me up, I was awake but my mind was taking a rest, a rest from everything, from thinking, from moving and from the huge fight that was going between me and Satan.
A part of me was willing to get back the way I was, but the second part wanted to stay wild and completely free.
"Try this" He smirked.
"WEED !!" I gasped and he covered my mouth.
"SHHHT, yesh it's weed, try it, you'll feel great !" He keot convincing me but I refused.
