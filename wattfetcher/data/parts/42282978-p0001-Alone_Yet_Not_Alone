It's funny how you feel companionless when you're in the middle of a planetary carousel. I guess that's just how depression works. You don't cavort around like normal people who don't have as many problems. After my parents died in an airplane crash, I haven't been the same, even though I'm 18 and I live by myself with all my parents money. As they say: Money can't buy everything, in this case- I can't buy my parents back.As the music palpitated my body, people ran around dancing with the beat which (I swear) shook the ground. I got pretty inattentive really quickly, so I got up and started to walk towards the pool. Just when I wasn't paying attention, I scampered into what felt like a spongy tree. I looked up at the towering figure. I couldn't believe my eyes! It was my classmate, not so Scrawny Shawn. So far, we've made eye contact a couple times in the hallway, but never had a conversation. "Whoa, clam down! No one needs a roamer around here." he said in a barbaric tone, as if he was trying to be Mr. Cool Guy. I guess 'boys' are just at that age now where they try and prove themselves to girls. Honestly, they make them self look stupid. "Oh, I'm so sorry. I-I-I didn't mean to. Yeah, ok. Sorry." I tried not to babble. Since I don't talk to people much, I get shy sometimes. "Yeah, better watch your back!", I couldn't believe he said that! I walked past him and his clique, to the pool side. 25% of me wanted to jump in and join the booming party, but the other 75% of me told me to save my own ego. Seventy-five always beats twenty-five, so I went to one of the pool chairs and sat down. I saw everyone in the pool with wide grin spread across their faces. I watched as if I was green with envy. Why couldn't I be that way? I thought. This world is so empty. Eventually I drowned in my thoughts as I sat there on the pool chair.
