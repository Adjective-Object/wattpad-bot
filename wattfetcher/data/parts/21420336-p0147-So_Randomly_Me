HEY IM ALIVeeeeeeeeeeeeee

*awkward silence*

so guys I had a dream
I saved a tiny dolphin

it was

thissssssssssssssssss big

But like I didnt know where to put it so I dumped it in a fish bowl
and it jumped out and hit my nose

I liked that dream tbh
I think Nico appeared like once
don't remember why though...

Oh well.

As a demigoddolphin I found the dream very touching tbh
