What the hell is amnesia? Amnesia is when you say too much of something? No.
"Hello, strange people who work here, do any of you know what amnesia is?" I shout.
Then a worker, that's what I'm calling them for now says "Amnesia is when don't remember or have lost your memory/memories."
"Ok, also can you tell me and then show me how this box thing works?" I asked the worker politely.
The worker replied "Sure. Ok so this is a phone, something you use to call or text."
After the worker told me what it was and how to to use it. The worker showed me how to use it and all the other apps on my phone as well. Turns out I have a lot of contacts.
"Nikki you will be out of the hospital tomorrow and your sister Lucy will take you home." said a worker who for some reason looked like they were one hundred years old but really they were only forty-nine.
I just nod my head. About two hours later my phone starts making a weird noise. What does this mean, am I going crazy? Wait is this these things called phone calls I was told about.
I quickly answer and say "Who is this stranger I am talking to?"
The stranger "This is Lucy, remember I am your sister."
I replied "Oh yeah, so..um what do you want Lucy?"
"Just making sure you are ok. Also I was wondering how you got amnesia and in the hospital?" said Lucy.
I answered "I have no memory of anything so don't know, sorry."
She then ended the call. Wow, that was my first phone call! I think it was my first phone call but whatever.
My sister Lucy now here walking me out to her car. I'm finally out of the jail, wait I mean hospital. I'm free!
"Nikki school starts in two weeks so I am giving you a makeover just like I promised." said Lucy.
