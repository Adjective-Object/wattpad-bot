ROSS' POV
Dont I always
Why did I feel bad when she said that, I know that I always do stupid things....but I dont always expect her to forgive me. No matter how hard I try to not upset her something always comes up, I dont want her to feel like she has to put up with my shit, but at the same time.....I don't want her to leave me.I walked over to the bed, sat beside her and pulled her into a hug. I expected her to push me away but to my surprise she hugged me back.
Ross - Babe, I'm so sorry
Ariana - Its ok
Ross - Are you sure?
Ariana - Yeah
Ross - Do you like it here?
Ariana - Well..I haven't really been anywhere except for the mall so...
Ross - We could go to the beach tomorrow?
Ariana - What about Riley?
Ross - She's coming of course
Ariana - Ok
Ross - Goodnight....marshmellow
That caused her to laugh
Ariana - Are you serious right now?. I though you stopped calling me that
Ross - Well I didn't
Ariana - Why do you even call me that?
Ross - Well...cause marshmellows are so soft and you're well...
Ariana - I'm not soft!
Ross - Yes you are
Ariana - Whatever, goodnight
Ross - Goodnight
