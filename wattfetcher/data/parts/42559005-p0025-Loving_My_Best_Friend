sooner or later we hear the front door open and people walkinv through the house.
to be honest im really scared , i hate people fighting and yelling, i always have.
"I DONT WANT YOU TWO NEAR MY DAUGHTER AGAIN!" i hear my dad yell. "DONT TALK TO MY DAUGHTER THAT WAY!" miranda's dad yells.
i hear things being thrown and slammed. i flinch, and whimper. "JOHN STOP IT! my mom yells. i hug my knees.
then i just hear yelling.
"baby....you ok?" jack says sitting by me hugging me. i shake my head. "its alright baby girl...everything will be alright" he says rockin me back and forth, with me in his arms.
then i hear footsteps running up the stairs. then someone barges in. "YOU FUCKING BITCH!" cole yells. i flinch.
"YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM HER!" jack yells getting up. "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT!" cole yells.
tristen comes next to me and we hold each other. sammy and jj are telling jack to not start anything.
then cole swings a punch at jack in the face and kicks him making jack fall to the ground. i see jack get pissed and starts getting up, samny and jj are holding him back.
i dont know what got a hold of me but i got fucking pissed instead of scared. i got up and walked up to cole shoving him.
"HEY! YOU FUCKING DICK DONT FUCKING TOUCH HIM!" i say slapping him.
then cole did something so cold hearted....
he slapped me.... hard.i heard tristen gasp and it got quiet.
tears started cascading down my face . it hurt so bad.
"YOU DICK DONT TOUCH MY FRIEND!" tristen yells running towards him. but sammy grabs her and holds her.
"you son of a MOTHER FUCKING BITCH, IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!" jack yells charging towards cole.
jack pushes cole which makes him fall the the floor. cole looked a little scared. jack jumped on him, and started beating the fuck out of him. he is going to kill him!
"HEY YOU BOYS STOP IT!" i hear miranda's mom yell.
even tho i want cole dead, i cant let jack do that, they will arrest him.
i get up and go to the boys. "JACK STOP YOUR GONNA KILL HIM!" i say pulling him but he wont budge. then cole gets a hold of jack and flips them, then cole starts beating jack, and jack is trying to get up.
"MOM DAD HELP!" I scream crying.
i see my dad, meghans dad, and david run and then try to pull the boys apart.
