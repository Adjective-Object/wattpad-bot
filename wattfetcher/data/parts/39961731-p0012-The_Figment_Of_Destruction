Lily was shocked at first, but then started smiling. She walked up to me and pushed me out of her way to get to Shawn. I scoffed and rolled my eyes.
"You really mean that?" She asked.
"Yeah..." Shawn whispered. She started to grin.
"Okay. I'll go out with you." Lily squealed. "Maybe even more!"
"If you want..." Shawn replied. She squealed again. She then jumped onto Shawn. He grinned and spun her around. Then, they kissed. The cafeteria erupted in cheers. I'm not gonna lie, but I enjoyed watching this only because Lily was finally happy with someone.
Once they pulled away from each other, he set her down and hugged her. She obviously hugged back. While the cafeteria was still making noise, they both turned to me.
"Thank you." They both told me.
"You're welcome." I replied as everyone in the cafeteria continued to cheer.

(Hey again beauties!! I know it's weird to have two parts of a chapter but since the first part was long, I wanted to cut it in half to make it easier. And plus Wattpad was being annoying to me so I had to stop there. But I'm done with Chapter 4 so I'll update the next chapter when I have time. I love you all! Baii! And remember to vote and comment!! .xx)
