Natalie's P.O.V---------------------------------After the day I ran off to the park because my mother was doing drugs and she started to beat me so I ran out of the house to the park bench and fell asleep because I was so worn out from running everywhere.
When the boy with dark brown hair and brown eyes came by and slightly shook me to wake me up I was frightened , I thought he was gonna hurt me but I was wrong he had a look of concern and loving in his eyes. I regret running off like that I hope I see him tomorrow.
I fell asleep on the sidewalk in an alley way and I felt someone kicking me when I saw who it was I screamed. It was this jock from my school named Jacob, he bullies me all the time and never leaves me alone. When I looked up he was knocked out on the ground . i wonder who did that?.
