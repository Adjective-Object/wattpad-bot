Last night, my mind was racing, as it always is Thinking enough thoughts to flood hundreds of minds Enough to drive one insane if they lived within flesh and bone Perhaps all ideas rushing and coursing, intermingling and entwining Tangling and confusing, tangled in confusion
My mouth is not capable of speaking eloquently During such times my mind is given permission to overtake my lips The mind, my mind, does not think, it goes It runs, a kite on an endless string, dangling in the sky A kite flying, without a thought, ignorant of care
Words were said; while I was lingering, watching and talking Such verses that set me on edge, alert The walls instantly rebuilt themselves, in a vain attempt to protect Me, you, us.
Informing you of said conversations seemed logical To my overthinking mind, over wired mind, over confidant mind It slipped, seemingly flippant, nearly nonchalant I could nearly taste the distain in your words That sound of hissing breath to draw into an 'Oh' installed dread in my blood I knew that my mind had betrayed me, the walls too highly built Established intimacies already in place, I crushed them, blindly in defense A secret such as ours cannot be known, it simply is not a leisure gifted to us Condemned by society, our minds, the stars Fate, has worn the mask of separating us, yet I have triumphed that fiend That mask is in the possession of my hands, I bring it to my face Hiding flawless, silken skin from the sin that I've labeled us to be Is it not my fault why I carelessly allowed lyrics of my own defense Slip through my teeth, to your ear, piercing your heart My quick genius truly is a matter of impudence, indeed.
Desperately, I long to apologize, only in code may I say so Pride fights in allowing my expression of emotions, many of which I detest I miss the numbness, it was easier, now I have emotion, you, misunderstanding Impulsivity demands I show you physically of my remorse Only to exhale a muttered apology against your lips, you would know then.
