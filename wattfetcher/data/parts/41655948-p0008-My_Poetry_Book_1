I've been cold, so cold.
I've got stories I've never told
About when I used to be bold.
Before the tide crashed in
And it feels like these are the same things I keep sayin'.
It's all about what you can't see.
Between the lines of my poetry
Lies the real me.
I've been living in black and white
And I'm not a very pretty sight.
I've been looking for a little bit of light.
But you know I love the dark, the night.
Dying dreams and empty bottles on the floor
I'm dead right down to my core.
I walk along the beach, the shore.
I can't help but hear the roar
Of silence and I know
I'm the water, the blue, the dark, the sea.
I can't be what you want me to be.
But little do you see,
You are the energy
That moves me.

A/N - I don't know why I write alot of poetry about the ocean (or the sea), the darkness, and the stars. Haha I just now realized that the majority of my poems have something about at least one of those.
