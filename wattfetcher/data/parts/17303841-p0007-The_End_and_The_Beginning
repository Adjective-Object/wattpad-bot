I walked with her to the car then stopped a second. "Lily how would you like to stay with Nana May for a few weeks?" she shook her head frantically. "It will be safe there, you will be safe there" I pleaded. "I need you Nina, please don't leave me, I don't want to lose you too"
"I almost lost you today because of those men and what if there are worse people out there, then what Lily, I stand by and watch you get hurt"
"You have a power use it!"
"I wish it were that simple but I can't, the more the use my power the more power I get, It happened once before, when I first got my power at 8 they pushed me so hard to be strong, I eventually was able to lift ten whales at once, one was heavy enough. I kept on going till it overwhelmed me too much. In my sleep I made every object around me in a 10 mile radius float and I wasn't even aware until I woke then everything dropped, even house were lifted off the ground, I had lost control and I'm not going back to that" Lily hugged me but I made up my mind, I was taking her to nana's were she would be safe. We got in the car and headed back home which by now should be the last place we should be going because of the amount of danger we could be in. I went in alone when we got there and grabbed the essentials then stupid as it was locked the broken front door. Then we left for nanas.
