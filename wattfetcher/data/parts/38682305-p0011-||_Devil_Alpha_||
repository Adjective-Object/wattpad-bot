How can I hear him? He isn't here, right? Or maybe I'm loosing my mind. Yeah that makes more sense. Yeah, I'm just going crazy, why would my own brother take me? Is he even my brother?

My 'brother', went off somewhere."MARIA, MARIA!", the loud voice bounces off the walls, I turn my body as far As I could looking for the voice.Luke. ••• Luke wouldn't let me talk to Michael, but I needed to. If he really is my brother I can't pass up this opportunity, my brother, he thought I was dead!    "You don't even know if he's your brother! He took you away from me, why would he do that if he was your brother!?", Luke asked pushing his brown curls away from his face.             I kicked  a rock and ran to Luke's car, the shiny black door was really hot, so when I touched it I flinched. Luke ran towards me, taking my small hand in his large one he examines the bruise on my hand.    I swatted his hand away from mine, "I'm fine." He nods lightly ignoring the pain in my voice. We drive back home and I loose my only chance to meet someone I'm related to. And it's all Luke's fault.••••|| OKAY THE NExt CHAPTERS ARE FULL OF ROMANCE!!! SORRY ITS SHORT |||
