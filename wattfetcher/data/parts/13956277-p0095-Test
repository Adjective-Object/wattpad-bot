I couldn't be more excited while getting ready for school because I'm willing to see the faces of those who disgust me the most in the school.
"Good morn- Hi ! Who are you?" I saw a beautiful brunett chick, Damn! She looked gorgeous, and I'm a girl though, I shouldn'tÂ  say this.
"I'm Ray, Damon's new girlfriend, I'm also living in the house right beside this one" She smiled and showed her perfect white teeth, "Morning Leena" Damon said and held his girlfriend's hand, I'm not gonna lecture him about this but whatever he aint gonna listen anyway ... "Be careful Ray, he's kind of a jerk" I said then went out with Elina.
"Why are you so happy today? You hate waking up for school !"Elina asked, "You'll see" I laughed out loud as I parked my dear car beside the school. "Robin, ready?" I asked him as we stood waiting for Miley and Conor to open their lockers, "I was born ready babe" I slapped his arm and told him to turn the camera On, "It's gonna be a moment we'll never forget"I smirked, "Elina, come and watch carefully" I pulled her from Lewis' grip, "What's going on?" Lewis asked but me amd Robim shushed him, "5..4...3.....2..." Robin counted, "ONE" We both shouted in sync as Miley and Connor opened their lockers in sync too, "AAAAAHHH" They both shouted, The whole students were laughing as the rats jumped on me enimies' heads, so was I. "You did not-" Simon couldnt complete the sentence because he was to weak to speak beteen the laughs of his, "Yes I did" I managed to say as I was holding my belly whils bursting in laughter, "YOU" Conor shouted while walkimg toward my direction, "I'mma beat the hell out of you" His face was as red as a tomato but I couldn't do anything because I was still out of breath, "YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY" He caught the hem of my blouse and pushed my back to the wall, "Oh shut up" Simon said then punched Conor's face, then I started laughing again but harder than I already was, "I love you Robin" I sighed but Robin was rolling of the floor while laughing, I felt my Hijab falling slowly, then I realized someone was puling it. In a second my head became naked, everyone around me gasped, I looked behind amd saw Molly grinning, "You wanted to play dirty" She said with a smirk then, a pair of huge hands and large chest covered me, "Look away jerks" It was Simon that blocked them from looking at me, "Cover your head, why are you frozen" He said while he was still covering me, "you don't look either" I slapped his cheek, My hijab wasn't on my neck "You cant stay in this position for too long, I actually like this thing, suits my shirt" Molly said as she folded my hijab and stuffed it in her bag, I couldn't run get it from her, and Simom couldn't either because he was the ome covering me, "Oh boy" Simon said as he quickly took of his shirt and put it over me, I looked like an umbrella and couldnt see because he wrapped it quickly over my head barely leaving any whole for my nose to breath, "Who's laughing now?" Conor chuckled as he and Molly went to the bathroom to wash their faces probably. I stood their embarassed with Simon standing beside me shirtless not making the atmosphere any better, plus his shirt over me, "Didn't go the way we thought it would" Robin sighed, "It's fine, I'm not over yet, I'll show them what happens when Leena gets mad" I said angrily, "You look like sushi with this green shirt" Simon laughed and I punched his bare chest, "You've done something nice to me, don't make me hate you again" I said, "Fine" He pretended to look sad with the uncovered side of his face, "Now what?" Elina asked, "I'll think of something".
I went back home after the worst day in school, then to my job.
"Here's your paycheck" My boss gave me my money then dismissed, "Hi" Simon gave me half a smile, "What are you doing here ? Last time you came I was about to get fired" I whispered, "That's how you thank me for giving you a shirtless hug all girls wish for, I'm Simon ! THE Simon, Ladies stand in line for Simon" He said sarcastically, "You see any clue for a lady in me ? NO. What do you want?" I said as I took money from a woman and gave her her bag. "I've been thinking and ...", "Man ! Subhanallah! You were thinking ! Can't believe it" I chuckled, "I'm serious" He said, "No, you're Simon" I laughed at my sense of humour and he sighed and rubbed his face, "let's go to the park" He said, "I ain't going nowhere with you" I raised an eyebrow, "Come on! You now owe me two favors and nobody wanted to go with me " He sighed, "Ladies stand in line for THE SIMON, ha ?" I chuckled, "Come on, plus, you haven't been anywhere but the school and this mall, let me show you the city. It's a good way to have fun after what you've been through today" He explained, "I don't know, I'm not supposed to-", "Come On! Stop this bullsh*the and have fun for a night ! It's not like we're gonna be alone! It's a public place, and it's also not a date, just friends hanging out, no touching no inappropriate words, Just fun. What do you think?" He begged for me to agree, "I think that...", "Please please say yes", "I think that you're right and I should get some fun" I said, "He'll yeah!" He jumped I'm the air, "Be ready in 5", "Got to help you then" He jumped and stood beside me and started helping me like he did last time.
