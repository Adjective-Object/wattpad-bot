A/N: To those of you who like twilight: if you read this you might get fired up with me.To those of you who agree with the meme above read this it is directed towards YOU!WARNING IF YOU LIKE MY BOOKS BUT HATE TWILIGHT DONT BE MAD AT ME ITS ONE OF MY FANDOMS AND YOU JUST NEED TO NOW THIS JUST PLEASE DONT BE MAD.
PEOPLE SEE THE MOVIE TWILIGHT AND DONT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING SO I GET THAT AND THE BOOK IS AVERY GOOD LOVE STORY OKAY. IT HAS SOME ACTION IN IT BUT ITS MAINLY ABOUT LOVE. PEOPLE SEE A MEME OR JOKE ABOUT HOW BAD TWILIGHT IS AND NOT KNOWING A THING ABOUT IT JUST LIKE THE PERSON THEY SAW THE JOKE FROM.
ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO SAY "still a better love story than twilight" SHOULD GO F*** THEMSELVES
THE WORLD NEEDS LESS FOLLOWERS PEOPLE CANT BE LIKE SOMEONE MADE FUN OF TWILIGHT BETTER GO MAKE FUN OF IT IN THE EXACT SAME WAY BECAUSE IM TO RETARTED TO HAVE MY OWN OPINION AND FACE THE FACTS THAT TWILIGHT IS NO WHERE NEARLY AS BAD AS YOU WOUPD THINK!!!!!
SO IF YOUR ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT STOP OR GO READ THE BOOKS. KEYWORD BOOKS. AND IF YOU STILL HATE IT WELL THAN AT LEAST YOU MADE YOUR OWN OPINION YOU WERENT JUST A FOLLOWER.
