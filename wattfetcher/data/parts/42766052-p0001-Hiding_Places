You freaking broke me.
You used your stupid ass phone to do it.
Your phone with the crack in the corner that had spread downwards.
Your phone that has that stupid emoji sticker stuck to the case.
Your phone that played the Stars Wars theme when someone called.
Your phone that you used to break my heart in half.
With three simple damn words.
I hate you.
That is how you ended it.
I wasn't different from the others.
You ended it like that with them too.
Aren't I special?
