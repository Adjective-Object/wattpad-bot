A/N sorry that I have a lot of stories it's just I have so many ideas and inspiration from everything around me.______________________________________
Ember's POV:
I felt the flames engulf my hands, I smiled. I turned to the left to see my friends get shot down one by one. Blossom, a green orb lifting off the ground. Aqua, a blue orb coming from her body. Then Aira, a ball of white appearing."Come to me" I called out before the enemy could. I screamed in pain as each orb connected with my body. The enemy started to shoot but all my powers protected me as I passed out.
Many days later:
I stumbled down the road but stopped abruptly in my path as I passed a TV shop. I spun around."Charles Xaivior has decided to open up a school for 'gifted' children and will welcome anyone. Only mutants will resieve the location" the man annouced before the channel switched to Sports. I smiled and started to walk faster down the streets with a newly found hope. I heard something in my head luring me towards a mansion that was very hidden from the outside world and a sign read, 'X-Mainsion'.I squealed in excitment as I pushed open the gates and rushed towards the doors.
