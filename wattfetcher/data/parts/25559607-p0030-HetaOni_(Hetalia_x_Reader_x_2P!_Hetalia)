Canada was sort of trembling, but managed to get up. "Y-you two... b-b-better run..."
The Thing suddenly attacks Russia.
"R... Russia!!" Canada exclaims.
Russia took a hold of his arm for a while. "... That hurt. The water pipes in this place really are no good at all. Good thing I got one of my own!" He said, smiling.
Canada creased his forehead. "I-it's not use! Even if it's yours, it's just a tap!"
Russia tries to prove the Canadian man wrong by attacking the Thing once more..
"Huuuuuuuh!? How come the pipe turned into a sword!?" China said in a surprised tone.
"Ahah. Actually, this is a sword cane. I asked Japan to make it for me! It's really sharp, isn't it?" Russia says proudly.
Russia attacks the monster once more.
China covers his eyes a little. "Woeeeeh! That's nasty!!"
"But it didn't cause any damage at all..." Canada says in a low voice.
"L-let's give them reinforcements!" England suggests.
China nods. "Right, aru!"
"Yeah!" I said, pumped up for another battle.
England suddenly stops me from taking a step farther. "Uh.. No, love. You stay where you won't get attacked by the monster."
I frown. "W-Wha.."
Then, they all go to Russia and Canada's side and try to battle Steve.
I waved my hand in front of me to check the battle stats.
This monster was one crazy mofo. He didn't even give the four countries time to give one attack. Then they all fell down. Though I know it was part of the game, I was still worried.
"Y-You guys..!" I called out.
"Ts... Aah... Haa..." Canada panted heavily.
Russia started to get up. "Aww, too bad. It didn't work at all."
China turned to the British man beside him. "England, why aren't you doing anything useful?!"
"No, er... Sorry. This place itself is blocking my magic; it looks like I can only use a small part of it..." England apologises.
"What a troublesome place!I have no strength left..." China says as he tries to stand.
Suddenly, Steve charges towards England....
"Er, wait a s-" England stopped and closed his eyes when he realised he was the target.
"England, watch out!!" I shouted.
Japan suddenly appears from above and attacks the monster like a ninja.
"I won't let you lay a hand on my friends." He says.
"EH?! J-Japan?!" England opens his eyes to see his Japanese friend.
I wave my hands frantically to catch Japan's attention. "JAPAN!! You're here!"
He then turns to me. " ____-chan?! There you are! We were looking all over for you."
China looks at Japan. "Japan? You know this girl?"
"I'll explain that later. Let's take care of that Thing first." I said.
Japan nods. "You're right. Ah, but this time..I'll do it on my own."
