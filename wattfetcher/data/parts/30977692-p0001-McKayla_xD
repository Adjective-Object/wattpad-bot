Hi! *waves*
I'm McKayla.
I'm fifteen years old!!
I'm 5'8.
I love One Direction!!
Music is my life, I don't think I could live without it.
I'm single.
I'm straight and a fucking pencil, but I can be persuaded.
I'm quirky as fuck!
If you don't like cussing, then I'm not the person you want to talk to!!
I'm not perfect. Not even close. Please don't be an ass, I don't judge you, don't judge me!!
