Ruby POV
I woke up the next morning by myself. I got up walked around the house and looked for my baby. I couldn't find her so I wallked back to get my phone when I read a text from her
My baby- good morning love, sorry I didn't tell you I left for work this morning but I had to go to work. I get off at 3 so I'll see you when I get home hopefully  .
I smiled and then sighed and got into the shower might as well get comfortable.
Natasha POV

I kissed her neck and rubbed down her sides . She moaned and flipped us pinning my arms down. I looked up at her and grind underneath her

She got off of me pulling me up " come on we have to go." My eyes grew wide " what? But I look terrible." "No you don't. Plus its just my parents. They won't mind come on." She pulled me out the door  here goes nothing.
