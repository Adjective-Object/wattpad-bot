Jacey's POV:
I sat in math class admiring the beautiful girl that sat at the front of the class.
It's my first day of Dacobson High and it sure is different.
*twitch*
I keep quite just to make sure no one notices I'm different from the rest.
I've seen where the 'different' people sit, it isn't nice.
The sit near the dumpsters.
The 'cool' kids pick on them.
*twitch*
I've only been here for half a day and I already know the clicks.
There is the 'different' peoples group.
There is the 'smart' group who I will probably end up sitting with because of my flawless grades.
#gloat.
Then there is the flawless group.
They are actually all flawless.
*twitch*
The boys look like they are a gift directly from god.
And the girls are the most beautiful humans you have ever seen.
But there is this one girl.
I'm not sure of her name but she is beautiful.
*twitch*
Long, thick brown hair. Tanned skin. A sexy mild Spanish accent.
Yes I'm into girls. No judgment.
Every move she makes is like a model at a photo shoot.
*twitch*
"Hey are you okay?" A blonde headed boy asked from beside me.
"Uh yeah why?" I asked
"You keep twitching" he whispered.
*twitch*
"See!" He yelled but not loud enough for anyone to hear.
"I have a twitch" I laughed.
"Ohh that makes sense. Im Tyler Plat." He spoke
"Haha I'm Jacey Wells"
*twitch*
"And we are in the same math class!" He stated.
I laughed.
Tyler was attractive but not in a sexy way.
It was in more of a cute way.
His dark blonde hair all swished to the side in a 'beiber flick'.
His peircing green eyes with dark long eyelashes surrounding them.
His slightly tanned skin adorable and not a blemish in sight.
"Soooo Jacey, wanna sit with my group at lunch today?" He asked *twitch*
"I'd love to! But will they think I'm w-weird?" I stuttered.
He gave me the 'I'm just as weird as you look' and shook his head.
"They'll love you" he replied
I began concentrating on my work and noticed that I had done all of this at my old school.
And was very good at it.
