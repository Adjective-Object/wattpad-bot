"How long will we stay there?" Haruka asked the 1st disciplinarian officer who was still red and dizzy form that hug.

"A normal detention is 8 hours. You'll only stay for four then get the rest of the day off."

"Yes!"

-

"I will regret this day for the rest of my life." Sakura stated as she stood in the doorway, seeing her new 'inmates' for 4 hours.

The room was being supervised by Sir Crocodile and the inmates at the time (yes, inmates because the room was literally a renovated jail cell) were Kid, Killer, Zoro, Sanji, Luffy. Not to mention, the Fire Fist who already found himself there.

"New inmates." Sir Crocodile said.
"Hai, sir."
"We're just scrapegoats for this idiot's idiocy." Sakura stated harshly pointing her finger at Ace.
"I see. The rules are simple." Crocodile stated looking at the slip which had their detention time periods, "Don't go out that door."
"That's it?"
"Yes, take a seat."

Sakura sat on the furthest end of the room by the window.  Aya sat in the second row and Haruka was behind Ace (he probably died from blood loss by now)

"Aya-chwan! You look beautiful today. May I sit next to you!" Sanji exclaimed, his eyes transforming into hearts.
"Go ahead, the world doesn't need you." Zoro stated with a straight face.
"What'd ya say? Marimo!" Sanji exclaimed.
"Who you're calling a Marimo?" Zoro responded, exclaiming with a shocked face. With all this, Aya just sat there and laughed.
"It's okay, Sanji can sit next to me." Aya answered with a small smile, patting the area next to her. Sanji was shocked but no one was as shocked as Zoro. Somebody actually took on Sanji's fantasies!
Whilst Sanji was in shock, his heart beat faster and faster until it became a drumroll. Sanji's face turned red and immediately on the spot, Sanji turned to stone.
"Damn perverted cook."
"Oh my."

Meanwhile, elsewhere..........

Sakura was in corner by by the window. she had headphones in her ears and she was reading a novel. She didn't care much for the mess that happened to the right of her.
She was in her own little world and she liked it.
"Yo Saki-chan." A squeaky male voice sang. Sakura sighed, no other decription needed. She took out her headphones and looked at the idiot staring at her
"What do you want?"
"I'm bored. Play with me!"
"Like hell."
"Why not?"
