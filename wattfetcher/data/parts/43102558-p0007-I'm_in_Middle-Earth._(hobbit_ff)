We arrived at the Blue Mountains. I met Dain, Thorin's cousin. "Stay close to me while we are here." Thorin whispered in my ear. I nodded. Thorin offered me his arm. I held onto his arm in fear. Dain led us to the meeting room. I sat down beside Thorin.
"Will you help us reclaim Erebor and defeat Smaug?" Thorin asked.
"We will not. This mission is yours and yours alone." A dwarf said.
"How come you won't help?! Erebor is your true homeland! You must take it back before anyone else tries to claim it! Thorin is more of a dwarf than any of you! He's not afraid to fight and die for his home unlike all of you! This is pathetic!" I shouted.
"It's alright Michelle. We don't need their help." Thorin spoke in disgust.
I walked with Thorin to my room for the night. "My room is next door if you need me." Thorin sighed. Thorin started to walk away. I closed my door and locked it. I bathed then dressed in a nightgown. I sat down on my bed. I decided to sing 'Since you been gone' by Kelly Clarkson before I went to bed.
"Here's the thingWe started out friendsIt was cool, but it was all pretendYeah, yeahSince you been gone
You're dedicated, you took the timeWasn't long till I called you mineYeah, yeahSince you been gone
And all you'd ever hear me sayIs how I picture me with youThat's all you'd ever hear me say
But since you been goneI can breathe for the first timeI'm so moving onYeah, yeahThanks to youNow I get what I wantSince you been gone
How can I put it? You put me onI even fell for that stupid love songYeah, yeahSince you been gone
How come I've never heard you sayI just want to be with you?Guess you never felt that way
But since you been goneI can breathe for the first timeI'm so moving onYeah, yeahThanks to youNow I get what I wantSince you been gone
You had your chance, you blew itOut of sight, out of mindShut you mouth, I just can't take itAgain and again and again and again
Since you been gone (since you been gone)I can breathe for the first timeI'm moving onYeah, yeahThanks to you (thanks to you)Now I get, I get what I wantSince you been gone
I can breathe for the first timeI'm so moving onYeah, yeahThanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (I get)You should know (you should know)That I getI get what I wantSince you been goneSince you been goneSince you been gone." I sang.
I laid back on my bed and fell asleep.
