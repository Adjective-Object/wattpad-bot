My phone buzzed in my pocket "Nice game with Simon, I'll make sure its the last one. Stay away from him or else ... S.A" What ? What is that supoosed to mean ? How did this stupid admirer kno- He got to be someone from the players, nobody else saw the game except who were playing. Jake, Tom Or Peter .... It cannot be William or Connor since they hate me ... But, what if he wasn't a HE, what if the secret admirer is a SHE ? Maybe it's a prank from Miley, but she wont pay for all of the presents I recieved .... But, why not ? She'd do anything she wants to revenge ... I have to see Robin to check the prank we're gonna do.
"ROBIN" I screamed my laungs out, it was launch time, everybody was talking,eating and laughing.
"Here you are !" He was sitting alone on a table, quiet and sad, "What's wrong ? Why are you sitting alone?" I asked, "I always sit alone" He took a bite from his cake, "Not anymore, from now on, I'll eat with you" I brought my food and sat next to him, "Tell me, where are your friends ?", "I don't have any", my heart ached, having 0 friends isnt easy, "And why is that?", "It's because I'm not cool and red-headed", "Who said you're not cool ? Plus, red-headed people are the hottest, If you were older I would date you", "Really ?", "No, I dont date ... but I mean it! You're good looking and it's weard that I'm saying this to a younger boy" Robin laughed, "It's Okay" he smiled, "Tell me, who are the cool boys here around your age?", "Here they are, they hate me" He pointed at a group of boys sitting together and laughing, "Follow me", "What ? Where ?", "Just obey and follow my steps" I walked to the table where the "cool kids" at. "Hi, can I sit here ?" I asked the one who seemed to be the leader of the grouo, "Yes of course, pretty girls are welcome" He winked, "You do realize that I'm at least 3 years older than you ?" I asked as I sat down, "I'm kidding, My name is Ben"He smiled, "And I'm Leena", "You are the one who got the big boys crazy ?" Ben asked, I burst in laughter "Come on ! Who said so?" I laughed, "Everybody says so", "Whatever, listen, this is my friend, Robin, COME HERE" Robim walked to us slowly, "Robin ? Come on? He's boring ..." one boy said, Robin turned his heels away, "How dare you ? Did you know that this boy here is the pranks master ? He can make you eat worms without realizimg it, he's good in illusion too" I smirked, Robin glared at me, "Are you serious?" Ben asked, "Yes I am, he can prank the biggest brain here" I said, "Then, he's welcome" Robin sat on the table with them and started talking.
"Thanks Leena" Robin said, "Don't forget our prank", "I didn't, Here's what we're going to do", "I'm all ears"...
"At night, we'll sneak into the school, I know a secret door, I'll get the numbers of Miley's and Connor's locker, Im gonna get some worms and rats, you get spray paint and cheese" Robin winked, "It's gonna be nasty, meet you at 8 behind the bushes". IM IN LOVE WITH THIS KID.
After school, I rememberd Nina, the little girl in the orphanage, I promised her to go again but I didn't, now its time to go there.
I was on my way inside my golden Range Rover until my phone rang, I stopped the car, unknown number, "Hello?", "Turn your car and get back home" A man said, "What ? Who are you?" But he hung up, weird, my phone buzzed again, "S.A" He's watching, following and waiting. How did he know where I'm already going ? At least now I know its a HE.
I rang the bell of the orphanage, the scary woman came out, "If you have anything to give, get in, if you dont, get out", "I dont, but I'll only stay for 5 minutes" She mumbled something but let me in, "Ninaaaaaa, Ninaaaaaa" I called her, I saw her angelic face from the little space between the door and its frame, "It's me Leena, remember me?", "Leeenaaaaaaa" she ran out and jumped at me, I saw her big sister glaring at me then she walked down the stairs to the scary woman, "Leena, did you bring any dolls this time ?" She smiled, "I'm sorry darling, I couldn't" I heard screaming and arguments from downstairs, "Nina, why dont you get in your room for a second and play with your dolls until I get back?" And then she started crying, "Whats wrong honey ?" I hugged her tight, "Nothing" she sobbed, "You can tell me anything, I wont tell" I used my hand as a tissue to remove her tears, "That bad woman took all the dolls and clothes" Anger filled me from head to toy, "I'll be right back", "No No you promised me not to tell" She hugged my leg, "I wont tell, I just want to see your sister" She let go of me and I went downstairs, the sound of yellimg was getting louder, "SHE IS YOUNG! STAY AWAY FROM HER ! I TOLD YOU I'LL DO ANYTHING BUT STAY AWAY FROM NINA"Nina's sister was shouting and crying, "For the 17th time, she is not one of them, I don't know her, she's just a teenager, she has nothing to do with our work so shut up before she hears us" The woman said, What work? Who are the "Them" ? .... We know people like youÂ  .. I remembered what Nina's sister told me the time I first came in here ..... We know people like you ... There's something wrong.
