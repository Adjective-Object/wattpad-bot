You're more of a determined, intense person and normal, asinine chitchat bores you, only tolerating it when you have to. And you're not really a phone person. When you want to get a point across, the energy you put into your words makes you pretty convincing. You're more the type to listen to others express their inner or personal thoughts than to divulge them yourself, so you may ask a lot of questions. You know how to keep others in suspense, that's for sure. You just hate to be misunderstood and would rather feel comfortable before "spilling the goods".
