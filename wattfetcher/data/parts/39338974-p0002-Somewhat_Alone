"Here, eat these and we can go get more food today, and maybe find a collar and some rope to keep James safe. How does that sound?"
He didn't answer, she looked over to find him trying to pull the nut out of its shell, his face all scrunched up in concentration. She shook her head and stood up, stretching and then beginning to untie the string surrounding them.
Once she was done she packed it all away and looked over to Charlie, who was now trying to feed the dog a pecan off on his grubby little fingers.
"Ok guys, let's go."
