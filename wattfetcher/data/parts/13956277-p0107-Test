We reached the airport, I saw her pulling herself like a zombie, she tried to carry her bag then she kicked it amd dropped it on the floor, "Calm down, I got this" I pulled her and my bag and got inside, they checked us looking for any suspicious thing, they let me pass quickly, but Leena got stuck for few minutes, they checked every centimetre of her and checked her bag 3 times, It's because she's Muslim, some people don't get that not all Muslims are terrorists and violence. Leena passed and we walked together, "Screw them, they're just idiots" I tried to cheer her up, Leena smiled, "And they call it the country of freedom" She said sarcastically, "It's not that bad" I sighed, "You're right, it's not that bad, at least there are you, Molly, Diana, Hannah,  Helen, Elina and many other friends" Her face lightened up a little bit.
They checked our passports and they gave us out tickets then we got into the plane, "Here are your seats" The hostess guided us to our seats, "Excuse me, but I booked two seats , one in the 1st row and one in the 2nd row, not two seats beside each other" I didn't want Leena to be uncomfortable because of sitting beside me for 12 hours, "I'm sorry but this is the only free seat" She said with a fake smile, "It's fine Simon, I don't mind" Leena said and I felt my legs floating, "But I'll sit beside the window" She said and I nodded.
We were sitting comfortably in our first class seats, Leena was telling me about her parents and childhood, "I'm sorry for interrupting you, but, can you teach me some Arabic so I can communicate with people? I don't want to sound like am idiot staring at people's lips and expressions trying to understand what they're saying" Leena laughed, "Too late, you already look like an idiot" Leena burst in laughter and everybody glared at us, but I didn't care because I was ready to pay do anything just to see her happy again, I removed the imaginary tears away from my face, "I'm sorry, did I hurt you" She frowned, "Kind of" I sighed, "Good" She laughed out loud again and I joined her, people around us gave us deadly glares, but WHO cares ?
"Excuse me sir, but some people complained,  can you please lower your voice?" I nodded and checked her out as she walked away, Leena slapped me playfully, "It's rude to stair at a girl's butt" Leena said, "Sorry" I chuckled, "Listen, I brought cards, want to play?" I asked her, "Okay".
"I GOT 3 HAHAHA I WON AGAIN" I laughed out loud, "Not fair" Leena threw the cards, "I'm the boss. Be right back, got to go to the bathroom" I stood up and accidentally dropped all the cards I was hiding, "Uh um, where did all of these come from?" I tried my best to look innocent, it didn't work, "YOU CHEATAAAAAAAAAAAA" Thank god she had her belt on because she was about to take my eyes off, I laughed, "I really should go now before I leave a surprise for the hostess on the floor" Leena laughed, "Eww".
Leena fell asleep, I kept looking at her, someone poked my shoulder, I turned my head and saw an Old woman about 80 years old, "Are you two together ?" She asked, I smiled at the thought of us being together walking hand in hand, "No, just friends" I smiled at her, "Don't lie, I can recognise love when I see it" She patted my shoulder, "It's kind of complicated" I took a glance at the sleeping beauty, she leaned her head on my shoulder, "Son, love knows no limits or lines, the age doesn't matter, the origins and languages doesn't make a wall in the face of love, so does religion" I smiled at the old lady, "Thank you, but I'm not good enough for her anyway" I frowned, "Believe me, the love in your eyes makes you way more than enough" She said then headed to the bathroom. At the end, there is always a spot of light at the end of the tunnel.
