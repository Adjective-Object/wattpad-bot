Its no secret . . . When you feel you've been wronged, you don't just shrug your shoulders and leave it be. Although your levels of action vary, you always do what you feel you need to do. Some call it seeking revenge but you see it as karma. You're clever too and will wait for the right time. You can be tit-for-tat, rather than vocalizing your hurt. You often feel people will not get where you're coming from.
