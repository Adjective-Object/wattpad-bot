Speeding down the Chicago streets, truck 81, squad 3 and ambulance 61 were on their way to a house fire. The sirens were blazing and the lights flashing, a flood of adrenalin was pumping through the veins of every person in the 51 family. "Let's save some lives boys!" Casey said. As soon as Casey got out of the truck he started shouting orders."Cruz and Otis check the first floor. Herman and Mouch check the basement. I got the second floor.""FIRE DEPARTMENT CALL OUT!" Herman shouted. As he was about to leave, he saw someone in the corner of his eye. "Mouch come help me get this lady out of here!" Herman shouted."Herman you got 2 minutes to get out of there before this house collapse" Chief said into the radio."Chief we got a lady we just got to get her out." Herman said back."Alright. But hurry."Herman and Mouch hurried up, getting her out of there as fast as they could. They finally had reached the door and right after they came out, the house collapsed. "That was close" Mouch said."Yeah, almost too close" Herman responded.Brett and Gabby ran over to the women."I got her." Gabby said. Gabby and Brett took the lady over to the ambulance and checked her out.Herman walked over. "Hey, how is she?" he asked."Looks like shes doing okay. Just some smoke inhalation. We're going to take her to Chicago Med just to make sure." Brett said. Herman nodded and was about to walk away when the lady stopped him. "Thank you" she said."For what?""For saving my life."
