"CHLOE,CHLOE are you up yet " mom was calling me. She must have called my name a million more times before I actually answered.Then she barged in my room opened up all the curtains and then pulled all the blankets off me."I'm up, I'm up mom"."Come on we have to start packing,were leaving in a few hours" mom said."I honestly don't understand why I have to help " I replied getting up."You can just hire moving people, considering you have enough money to move all over the planet" I said angrily."Chloe I understand that this is hard but-" "NO MOM YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, WE ALWAYS ARE MOVING , I WAS FINALLY ENJOYING IT..but you know what, there's no point in talking to you because I'm always the last priority".There was tears starting to come out of my eyes."Sweety,your not my last priority" she acted all innocent."Ok then , shall we. Number one you decided to get divorced without telling me.Number two you date a guy for a whole year without telling me then,when you are engaged decide to tell me ,I get a lazy irresponsible step sister that gets away with everything .Number three you drag me away from my dad for.... How long has it been , oh yeah about five years.Should I go on".Mom just stared at me shocked. I took my clothes and my towel and went to the bathroom to have a shower. I could hear mom slowly walking over to my bed and sitting down, after I left the room everything was silent .
