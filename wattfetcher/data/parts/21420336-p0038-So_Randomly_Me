So one day we were making fun of this lady
Cuz we were at open house and all she talked about was her dam graph paper.
LIKE LOOK OLD LADY NO ONE CARES WHERE THE GRAPH PAPER IS
So when we got home we laughed about it and joked around.
My mom came and said,"Something bad is gonna happen if you keep laughing at her!"
I couldn't help what happened next
I snorted (VERY ATTRACTIVE I KNOW) and said,"Like what? Are we gonna lose our graph paper?"
Later on I needed graph paper and couldn't find it ._.
I blame the lady.
