Natalie's P.O.V--------------------------------My name is Natalie waters I'm 16 years old and my life is pretty rough, my mom does drugs so my dad left her. She kicks me out of the house all the time so I just walk the streets.
In school I get bullied everyday for no reason . I cry in the bathroom everyday and I have no friends I'm also known as a nerd just because I get straight A"s all the time. So I just keep to myself and never talk anybody
That is until I meet my idol shawn mendes on the streets. Can he change my life or do I stay broken?
