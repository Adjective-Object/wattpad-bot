" oh and Justin don't push her into anything she doesn't want to do " her mom added grabbing a heavy pot and tried to carry everything
" here let me " I said taking the pot and then everything else and setting it on the table
" you seem like a nice young man your mom must have gave you a good raisin I knew your mother very well I'm surprised Scott didn't know you when you walked through the door but you look a lot like your father he was a very handsome young man " she said smiling
" you knew my father " I said shocked
" your father loved you very much but he was young and scared of being a father but he will come around" she said
" wow I never knew my father I never knew why he left thank you " I said
" need anymore help " I asked
" uh yeah do you mind setting the table" she asked
" not at all " I said setting the table
" looks like Shannon put him to work" Scott joked
" actually he offered his help" Shannon said
" good job sweetheart you got yourself a worker " Scott said kissing the top of Kylie's head
" thanks dad" she said smiling at me
" all set " I said walking over to the sink
" now go relax I got this " I said passing out drinks to everyone
" thanks Justin " she said down next to Scott
I finished up and joined everyone at the table for grace then sat down to eat
" so Justin what do you do for a living " Scott asked
" I go to high school during the week and then on weekends I do construction but I was off this weekend " I answered honestly
" oh ok that's a good thing to do working on weekends " her mom said
" yeah I guess " I said
After dinner (still Justin POV )
I walked over to the sink and started washin the dishes from dinner
" Justin dear you don't have to wash the dishes I would have done it " Shannon said
" no its fine I got it its the least I can do " I smiled
" can I at least dry them" she asked which made me laugh
" what what's so funny " she asked confused
" kylie asked me the same question when I washing dishes after she made breakfast" I said
" yeah I see how that's funny" she said
" well I'm done now I got to go find kylie"I said walking out the kitchen
" ok " she said
" Kylie what happened with that Thayer guy " Scott said
"I.I .I we aren't together anymore he cheated on me " kylie said softly
" why let me get my gun where does this boy live "He asked
" he cheated on her and I pounded his face in and so no need to get him sir I took care of it " I spoke up
" is that true kylie " her dad asked her
She nodded
" well if justin handled it I don't see why. I should go after then. Thank you Justin" her father said
