Today was the day. I said to myself while holding my bags to the airplane, "Today I'm finally going to New Jersey." My parents wouldn't stop laughing because they new why I was so happy. I'm going to tell you why ...
I was crazy over the Dolan twins, specifically Grayson. I just didn't know why. Haha, his brother Ethan is not so bad, but all my friends tell me he's a bad boy.
. . .
"Chloe ‚ù§Ô∏è sent you a message:"Hey Jona, I'm really gonna miss you and don't forget to say hi to your grandma for me xox
[Me]:I'll miss you too üò≠ and I won't forget I promise :*
. . .
Chloe is my best friend in the entire universe, we knew each other since we were babies. She wouldn't do anything mean to me. Okay, so maybe I'm going to see my grandmother in New Jersey, but this is the first time I go t-here...?
I felt someone staring at me, someone that I knew...? It couldn't be!!! Oh my goodness, ETHAN DOLAN IS ON MY PLANE!
Okay, okay. "Be calm," I said to myself. "what is he doing here?" Ethan right away looks up at me. Shit! I must have said that out loud... (that was awkward.) He looks at me... confused?
[Ethan]:"Hey, I'm Ethan." His beautiful eyes look at me.
[Me]: "Hi, I know who you are... I mean.. Hi I'm Jona, Jona Nira."
I couldn't stop blushing, but I didn't know why. His brother is way better looking, but Ethan is so ridiculously nice, how could he be a fuck boy? I asked him what he likes to do, and of course, said making Vines. I already knew so much about them, but I didn't want to sound like a crazy fan girl haha. I told him a little about me.
[Me]: "I'm 15 and I live in Canada, I love penny boarding and singing... oh and I love pizza!"
I had to add the last part! He started laughing.
[Ethan]: "We have lots in things in common, but not the singing part. I'm horrible at it!" he said, while gazing into my eyes.
. . .
It was 12:41 A.M. When I woke up, I saw Ethan staring at me again.
[Ethan]: "Did you know you're so beautiful?" he told me.
After that he went straight to bed. I was seriously confused. Was he just talking to me or to another girl?
I went on Twitter to see what's up, and saw him post a tweet.
@ethandolan: "A beautiful girl, with green eyes"
Was he talking about me again? "I have green eyes!" I yelled.
"SHHHHH!" a random person yelled at me.
After I see, Grayson tweet:
@graysondolan: "I miss my bro, @ethandolan hurry up I wanna see you!!!"
Okay, so maybe Ethan was on a vacation... in Canada? Who would want to be there? It's fucking cold as hell! I went back to sleep, hoping Ethan wasn't talking about me...
. . . . . . . . . .
A/N: Hey guys, I'm new to this. I hope you guys like it for now. It would be great if you gave me new ideas to continue. Sorry it's so short.
Love you, xox ‚ô•~ Josh (P.S. I'm a girl.) üòÇ
