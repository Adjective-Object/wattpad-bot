"Why did you stab the man with his knife and your cloth of clothing wrapped around the knife?" She asked.
"I did that, because he was going to hurt someone. I also knew he would try to take me had I not injured him."
"He isn't injured, he's dead."
"The only way he'd die would be when someone stabs him in the heart and decapitate him. Trust me. I had injured him like that before. I also had done it to his other arm and leg. He still walked after that."
"You..." Her phone rang and she answered it putting it on speaker. "Kelsey what's going on? The dead guy have anything?"
"The dead guy isn't dead! His body was flat and still. I was at the widow and I saw him move. He's walking around right as we speak! Hurry up and come down!"
Then she screams as a window breaks. I jump up and throw the door open and start running to the sound of screams when I heard it on the second floor. I opened the door and saw him holding her against the wall about to bite her.
"Let her go!" I screamed as I jumped up and kicked his face.
He tumbled back and she fell on the floor. She coughed half hazard-ly. He came towards me, but I tripped him and pinned him to the ground.
"Stay down!" I yelled at him. "Miss, miss are you alright?"
"I'll be fine." She said as she could finally speak. "Who are you?"
"Jaycie, Jaycie Everheart." I replied.
That's when Detective Beckett and other men came and got him and asked Kelsey questions. Then of course I had to go back up stairs in the same room and wait.

*Alexander's POV*
"Oh and the blood on the side of my face is from one of the vampires." I said after I had watched the car drive off.
"Who are you?" He asked not believing me.
I sighed and repeated what I said earlier.
"My name is Alexander Hopper. I am Jaycie and Paul's half-brother and son of Derrick."
"Your lying! Paul would of told me!" He said getting out of my hold.
"Paul doesn't know me. Neither does Jaycie. I just came here to tell Dad my mom isn't with us anymore. She went home." I said.
"What do you mean?"
"I mean my mom is dead and in heaven."
He frowned.
"Don't tell him that. He just lost..."
"He just lost his mate? Yeah I know. I've been told that. She was a great person and I'd chose her over my own mother, because my child hood wasn't the best and she's the one who told me to go and explore. Another reason why I'm here is to pay my respects to her. Also to help my Dad. He had called me and told me about her death. I've been trying to get a flight back here for weeks. I also may have gotten lost my way here. Anyways, you must be Greg. Right? Future Alpha?"
"Yeah... How'd you know?"
"My dad. He told me what you looked like and said that you were Paul's best friend." I said with a smile.
"Umm... Yeah?" He said questionably.
"Alex? Your finally here. Thank Gosh! I thought you were in trouble." Dad said.
