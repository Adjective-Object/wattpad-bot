I just rolled my eyes while me and Andy were looking at some things. They just stared at us. Andy wrapped his arms around my waist resting his head on my shoulder.
"I dont like them staring at me like that, there staring like im there meal." I laughed. "Andy, in this case its the other way around." he chuckled sending vibrations through my body.
We walked somewhere else and the girls just followed us, one of them 'accidentally' dropped something and went to bend down making her skirt come up.
Andy rolled his eyes and turned me around pinning me against the wall not even a second after his lips were on mine I could here the girls scoff and the sound of there heels slowly fading off.
He slowly released and pulled back until our eyes met. I looked at him out of breath, our faces were only centimeters apart.
"Ahem." I heard someone say. We both looked at who did it only to find Bella smirking.
"Yea nothing going on my ass."
We just laughed and he grabbed my hand so we could go pay.
After that we went back to the food court we saw the girls again so I just flipped them off sticking my tongue out at them.
We both burst out laughing at their faces, we saw the guys at the food court and sat down and at chick-fil-a because its motherfucking delicious.
After lunch we all went back home me of course had to stay with at the guys house because we had our first day of training tomorrow and they still had to take 'precautions' with me. Tomorrows going to be hell.
