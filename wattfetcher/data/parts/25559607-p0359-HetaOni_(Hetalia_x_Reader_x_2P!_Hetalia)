"Hmm, I don't think we need to have three groups. We've already looked around the mansion to find the Second Players' base long ago. We're pretty sure they're not in the places we've already been in...but what we're not sure of is if they could be in the annexe." Prussia explained.


Japan nodded. "You're right...There's a great possibility that they could actually be keeping (Name)-chan there, too."


"So that means it'll just be two groups, then? One to go check the annexe and to look for (Name), and the other group to go back to the past and kill the enemy." England said. The others nodded in agreement.


France stepped forward. "Hmm, I think I'll go to the past, then~"


"I can go, too." China said, walking over to France.


Russia smiled and followed after China. "Me, too."


"Oh, then I'm coming with you. What are you going to do, America?"Canada asked, turning to his brother.


America shook his head. "I'll stay. I want to search the annexe."


"All right. Then you four have to stand close to the magic circle." he told France and the others. Turning to the Northern Italian, he spoke, "Italy, give me the journal."

Italy nodded and handed the journal to him. England walked over to Canada  and handed him the journal. "I'll leave this journal with you, once you kill the enemy, you have to open it on the last page. Be careful not to interact with our past selves in any way. You have to do as the journal says, without changing the past. And come back as soon as you kill the enemy." he instructed.


Nodding in understanding, the four went over to the magic circle.


"Yes sir. Well, then, we'll be right back from our killing spree. Take care, guys." France grinned.


Spain waved at his friend. "Yeah, you too!"



In a flash the four were teleported back to the past.


"Well, now...those whose weapons are being fixed should wait here. So should you three who came back from the past." Japan said.
