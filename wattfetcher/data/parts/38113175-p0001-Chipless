No, this wasn't happening. Tears gather in my eyes, my friend Lily's hand touches my shoulder. "It's ok, cry." She says, her voice soothing. I bury my face in her shoulder, crying my eyes out. "Aaron loved you, and he still loves you now."  Aaron is my brother, well, was my brother. He just committed suicide. My eyes burn from crying, Aaron was one of the only people who excepted me after I came out. Now I have no family left, I'm officially an orphan.   I run outside, my eyes swollen and red. I heard someone call from across the street, "I guess he really is a girl!" Jared Massey. A kid who's bullied me sense I was in second grade, maybe even first. Didn't help when he found out I was gay.   He shouldn't mess with me right now. I pick up a rock and hit him right in the face. His friends look at me and then at him and his bleeding face. I don't feel guilty or ashamed. He deserves it. "Anthony!" I turn around and see Lily running towards me. "The cab is here to take you to the orphanage."   "They're gonna have to drag me there if they really want me!" I say under my breath. I start running, fast. I reach the woods after a good ten minutes of running and I don't hesitate to enter.   "ANTHONY!" Lily screams, "ANTHONY COME BACK!" I don't stop. I have no reason to. There is nothing back there that interest me, not even Lily, who's my best friend.   I don't know where I'm going. I'm not even going to guess. All I know is it's better than where I'm coming from in ever way possible.
