I found that picture on Google today and it just really explain alot of how shitty life is. Why is it that the persons that hate you and hurts you have easy access to you while that one person you love is miles and miles away it sucks really really bad. When it comes to people I love I get soft its like no matter what you do I'll still love you and I'd go to the moon and back just for you. Whenever I talk with Michaela I sometimes tell her about how I feel and she always knows the right things to say but whenever I ask her why you can't be here with me are me there with you she always go speechlessness because I guess that's one thing she will never be able to tell me the answer for. I think Michaela gets scared when I tell her if you ever leave I'm leaving with you and she always looks at me with tears in her eyes and I just hug her but I don't tell her I won't do it cause I know if you give up I'm giving up with you.....
