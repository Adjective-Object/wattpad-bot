(Why did they have to come here...? Why...? Even if something happens to me, if my brother is here--)
(No. I've already had too much of the first time and I'm getting confused. I have no idea what I should do.)" Italy started to panic internally.
Romano noticed his brother's silence, "Veneziano?"
"I'm sorry, Romano. I have to go. I'm sorry, but... just go home!" the younger brother told him and walked away.
"Ack! YOU BASTARD!!
Wait!!" Romano exclaimed as he was about to climb down the rope ladder.
Spain stopped him from descending, "Whoa!! No, Romano! I'll try going down the ropes first, and you just wait here, okay?"
"Can you really use this ladder? I can't seethe bottom very well..." Romano said, trying to adjust his eyes to the darkness below them.
"I think it's okay? Though I can't see it very well, either. The boss will go down first, so wait just a moment!" Spain said.
The Spaniard slowly climbs down the rope ladder.
"It's fine. The ropes aren't even rotten..."
He failed to notice the ladder was burnt halfway, causing himself to fall down.
"Spain?! A-are you okay?!" Romano asked after hearing a loud thud.
Spain winced in pain and rubbed his bottom. "Ugh... ow... Oh, no, the ropes are burnt halfway down... I hadn't noticed... Ooh, ow."
"H-hey!!" Romano called out.
"Romano."
"Yeah?"
"I'm so glad Ita is all right." Spain said, smiling.
"... Hn."
The Spaniard then stood up and spoke, "I'll see if I can find something to use instead of the ladder. Wait just a moment."
"All right. Don't take too long, or I'll get down this, anyway. A-and...b-be careful..." Romano said shyly.
Spain grinned upon hearing the Southern Italian's words. "Oh! Are you worried about me? That makes me so happy! I'll be right back, so just wait right there."

"Okay, honey~ We told you want you wanted to know! Now, tell me what fabulous name I've been bestowed?~" 2P! Romano piped up.
"Flavio. Flavio Vargas." I told him, smiling a bit. His character is so drastically different from Romano. His cheery mood's rubbing off on me a little.
"Flavio, hmm?~ It's fantastic! I think it really suits me, hon!~"
Luciano groaned. "Ugh. You fancy bastard, don't act so gay. It's revolting."
"Excuuussee me, voi poco cazzo?! What's his name anyway, honey?" he cussed at his brother then turned to me.
"Luciano Vargas." I replied.
Flavio flicked his hair to the side. "Hmph. His name sounds substandard!"
"Say that again, cazzo cagna?!" Luciano dared Flavio, his temper lost.
As the two Italians bickered, 2P! America went beside me and placed an arm over my shoulders.
"Well, while those two are busy bitching each other, tell me my name!" he told me.
