You want you're relationship to be permanent, which is why you take the necessary precautions to make sure your "mate" is on the same page as you. After a breakup, however, is when certain light bulbs tend to go off for you. You realize just how much you actually loved or enjoyed that person. Throughout the relationship, you tested your partner quite often and they obviously did things right to be kept around. Post breakup, you might talk about your ex a lot or take the hurt away by engaging in unhealthy behaviors (over-eating, self-pity, etc)
