When we got there the first thing I saw was Abby sitting on the front porch. I love her so much. So when I stopped she came over to me and smiled. I love her smile. Then I hoped off of my horse and she kissed me. I felt like sparks were flying. Then we untacked my horse, put him away, and went inside.

He mom had made fried Chicken and it was delicious. Then I said my goodbyes to Abby's family and she walked me out.

"How were my brothers? Did they behave?"

"They were great Abby. I will see you tomorrow."

"See you tomorrow," she tells me and then she hugs me. Then I hope into my car. Knowing that I will keep my promise of seeing her tomorrow.
