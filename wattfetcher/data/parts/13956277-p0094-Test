"Now chemistry, teach me" Simon looked like a happy kid while ordering things from me, "When NA+ and CL- get together, they make one little piece of salt" I said, "You really should get a dictionary and improve your vocabulary ! That's not how chemistry is taught" Molly laughed at her brother's words, Molly went to the bathroom and her mother brought me and Simon 2 plates of chocolate cake, "Thanks" I gave her a warm smile but she glared at me instead and left, Speaking of mad women, what is that ugly woman doing to the girls in the orphanage? Why are they so scared? "Ahh" Simon's gasp and the sound of the broken plate broke my thoughts, "Are you okay?", "I couldn't hold it" He said, the pieces of the plate were sticking in his ankle and the cake was on the floor, "Don't move" I removed the piece of glass from his ankle and cleaned the floor, I looked at him and noticed that his left hand wasn't good either, it was burnt too, that's why the plate fell "Open your mouth" I commanded, "Wh-" I cut him off by putting a spoon full of cake in his mouth, "Thank you" He said, "Do I really need a dictionary ?" I asked as I fed him another piece, "Not much" ...
We kept talking and laughing, I didn't even notice that Molly hadn't turned back. "You know what?", "What?" He asked, "Even if your pretty face doesn't get back like it was, I wont hate you like other girls will, I'll still be your friend" Simon exploaded in laughter, "Does that mean we're friends now ?", "Kind of ..", "Once you burn him then you feed him, weird teenager", "Mom stop it" Simon said, "I have to go now, bye" I took my bag and headed to the door, "It was nice to meet you" I said to his mother, "No, stay!" Simon said but I was already out.
Time to see Robin. I stopped my car away from the school and saw Robin, we got in from a secrer door and went to the lockers, "Ready?" Robin whisoered and I nodd, "On 3. 1....2....3" at the same time we threw worms the a rat in the locker then quickly put the spray. "Done" I said then we both sneaked out of the school while trying our best not to make a noise with out laughs. "I get everything, but what is the spray for?" I asked, "Well, you see my darling, when they open the locker, they'll freak out, when they see the spray they'll use it to kill the rat but it'll get creazy and attack them", "Ma shaa' Allah! Boy, you're genius"
Two updates in less than 24 hours, cool.
