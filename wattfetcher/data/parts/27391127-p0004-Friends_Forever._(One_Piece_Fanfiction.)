"Eh, we're here already?" Sakura asked being totally surprised. As they stepped out of the station, she noticed that she was walking on a funny type of cloud.
"This place is belle!" Sakura exclaimed. Whilst doing that, she noticed that she's been feeling a bit more powerful at least that's what she feels. That feeling has made her feel relaxed in a way.
"Feeling any better?" Ace asked noting her quiet and relaxed demeanour.
"Why, yes act- WHY THE HELL DOES IT CONCERN YOU!" Sakura complained.
"You sure are loud."
"By the way, where is the dorm?"
"Its up there and I can get us there fast."
"Oh really, how?" Sakura asked with a hand on her hip.
Luffy: Gomu Gomu no....
"His hand stretched."
Luffy: Rocket!
Sakura screamed as she was flying through the air hanging onto Luffy's arm for dear life again. Ace on the other hand was just plain shocked.
The journey was soon ended as they landed on the doorstep of Room 356.
"Baka! DON'T DO THAT AGAIN! I THOUGHT I DIED!"
"But you're still alive aren't you?"
"That's not the point!"
"Hey, you're pretty noisy this- oh, Ace and Luffy. You're here. And this must be our new room-mate."
"Why is your hair pink?"
"Do you like it? I can dye yours and make it glittery!" the strange girl asked sweetly fist pumping
"No thank you." Sakura rejected.
"Oi! Aya!" Luffy called.
"Luffy! We don't have meat for you."
"I hate you." Luffy said sulking in a corner growing mushrooms.
"His mood changed quickly." Sakura noted.
"Almost like yours." Ace teased.
"Shut up!"
"Oh, ~Ace-kun~ You're here!" a white haired boy sang spinning out of his bedroom. He had hearts in his eyes and was doing Sanji's famous noodle dance
-_-"
^^
"Is he gay or something?" Sakura asked.
"He's Haruka and yes he is.... sorta." Aya answered, also sweat-dropping. "He's the president of the Ace fan club."
"Great, then I wanna join!" Sakura exclaimed with sparkles.
"What's happening over there." Ace asked.
"Nothing!" Aya and Sakura lied, singing.
"I'm a member too." Luffy said somehow with a piece of meat in his mouth.
"Yes, that's tr- WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT MEAT!" Aya asked.
"In the fridge."
"Get out." Aya commanded pointing to the door.
"Okay." Luffy answered sadly walking out the door. Sakura also commanded Ace to leave much to the horror of Haruka from which Sakura received a scolding later on.
"Don't ever send Ace out the door again!"
