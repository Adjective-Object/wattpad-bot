Resent.It's one of the strongest emotions anyone could feel. And as the years went by my resentment became more and more uncontrollable.
He'll lie and steal, and cheat, and beg you from his kneesMake you think he means it this timeHe'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repairBut I still love him, I don't really care
So I just keep driving, not daring to glance in the rear view mirror. I don't know where I'm going; I don't know where I'll end up.
I've tried doing this before; leaving. Only to return a hour later because I missed him.
But this time was different, this time was real.
When we were young, oh, oh, we did enoughWhen it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled upI can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done
The way he held me when we slept, the way he kissed me before he went upstairs to take a shower after supper, the way his fingers moved along my skin when we danced in the kitchen.
The shade of red his face turned when I ticked him off, the sound of his unsteady breathing as he hit me over and over, the look in his eye when he realized what he was doing.
I wondered if he had figured it out yet or if he was still asleep. I wandered if he had gotten up and brushed his teeth and came downstairs to an empty kitchen. To cold coffee and burn bacon on the stove.
Maybe he was coming after me. But I doubt that since I don't know where I'm going, let along him.
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at allThe opposite of love's indifferenceSo pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming outAnd I won't leave until you come downstairs
Will he miss me long before he gets over it and moves on?
Will I ever move on? Will I ever stop missing him? No.
I'll never stop missing him.
I may forget the shade of eyes, or the sound of his voice but I'll never stop missing the man himself.
Ill never stop missing his presence.
The uneasy feeling I always had when I was with him.
Being with Hayden was exciting. Never a dull moment; he was always ether making me laugh, kissing me, or hurting me.
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at allThe opposite of love's indifferenceSo pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming outAnd I won't leave until you come downstairs
I feel terrible for leaving him with no one but himself and our empty house. But if I stayed I would end up mad. Overtaken with resentment and anger, and I never want to hurt him like he's hurt me for the past 8 years.

After I realized he wasn't coming back i just stopped.
Stopped living.
Stopped breathing.
I don't remember how I did it but now I sit here against the front door feeling the life slip away from me with no interest in catching it.
So keep your head up, keep your loveKeep your head up, my love Keep your head up, keep your love
Who will find me? No one probably.
