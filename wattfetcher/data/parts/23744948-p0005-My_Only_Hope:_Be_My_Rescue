“I’m fine.” I say. “How are you?”
He smiles. “I’m good. I got those books you wanted. They had three like those. They sound pretty good; I might even read them myself.” He laughs.
My eyes widen. I do not want him reading those books. Then he might figure out what I’m up to. If he doesn’t, I know his father will. I still fake a smile. “I thought you didn’t like reading.”
He rubs the back of his head, almost seeming embarrassed. “Yeah, I don’t really.”
“Well, I do!” I say, breaking the awkwardness Danny has seemed to put in our conversation. “So I’ll enjoy them a lot.”
Danny chuckles. “Oh, I know you will. Well, I’ll bring them in with dinner. See you then.” He got up and left. But before closing the door he stole another glance at me. I needed to find out what he was hiding.
