I looked over to where the doctor was and she had called for a nurse and they were doing something to my baby. My eyes felt heavy as a tear slide down my face.
I looked back over to my wife, and her eyes closed. I looked down and saw blood.
"She's bleeding!" I yelled and her eyes shut completely and her hand went limp.
The doctor called out in codes and people began to try and remove me from the room. I couldn't move I was stuck. In one corner my child lays not breathing and so is its mother. I felt myself brake down.
I yelled at the top of my lungs for them to help her. The machines were beeping loudly and I could somehow hear my heartbeat in my ears. Everything was in slow motion as they pushed me back, beat on my babies back and hooked my wife up to numerous things.
What is happening? What just happened?
