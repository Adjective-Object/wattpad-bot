Sakura recognized this song.

And on that day I'll firmly make it loud and clear.

By this time, a tear already rolled down Sakura's face.

My freedom is precious and I'll never let it go.
With hands of great power, I'll move on!

By this time, Sakura was already flowing with tears and the air was becoming moist so she ran to the nearest bathroom.

Haruka saw Sakura run to the bathroom with her hand over her mouth and tears. He quietly followed her to the bathroom.

"I can't cry. I can't cry." She repeatedly told herself.

"What the hell is she doing? An incantation?" Haruka thought to himself.

"Besides, Tiger-san said, it not nice for little girls to cry." Sakura said to herself looking at her reflection in the mirror.
