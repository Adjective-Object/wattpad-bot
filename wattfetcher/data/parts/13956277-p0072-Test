Every time you think that your life is perfect, every time you think that everything is going to work out easily, life surprises you with more ups and downs, but who are we to know what's best for us ? sometimes we choose the wrong direction just because it seems easier and with more pleasures, and we might hate something because it might seem harder, without knowing that this is the best for us. All we can do is trying, trying to choose the right thing and accept what Allah gives us because he -the greatest- only knows what's best for us, that's why we always must say Alhamdu lellah.
I accidentally came into this house, but I said alhamdu lellah.
I faced haters in school, but I said alhamdu lellah.
I was patient, I got great grades, I gained many friend- No, I gained many sisters from other religions, countries and have other beliefs. Alhamdu lellah, Maybe Allah put me here to realize how lucky I am to be a Muslimah, to realize how great and precious my religion is and to Test me, so this secret admirer might be part of the Test.
Elina kept whining and begging but there was no way I was gonna keep the things. Who is he ? What does he want ? How can he get in without being noticed by the huge muscular bodyguards outside ?  Thousands of questions crossed my brain.
But all I know is : If  that boy stalks me and wants me, he'll suffer and pay way much more than he already did.
"And the kitten ?" I looked at the white cute fluffy creature twisting on my carpet, "Meow" Ms.Fluffy caught my leg and rested her head on my toes, I've never seen such a cute thing in me whole life, "Please Leena" Elina begged again, I looked at the kitten who seemed to beg me too by rubbing her head on my leg.
"Okay" I lift the kitten "Can you tell me who bought you ?" , "Meow" That must be a no.
I looked at the little cute pink bracelet on its hand 'Pets and Plants' it said. That's a clue !
"Elina, check the bracelet *pause* do you know that place ?" At last, I'll get to know who my secret admirer is.
"Sure, It's in the mall, I once bought a bird from that place but my brother set it free" Elina cursed Damon under her breath, but he did a nice thing, he set the bird free ... though he just did that to tease his sister.
-Secret Admirer ....
Wallah when I find him I won't let him go with it easily-
"WHAT'S THAT" I said loudly after I saw a shadow cross my window, I ran to it and saw somebody in black clothes running fast and laughing loudly, "I'm not gonna let him go simply" I took a risk and jumped out of the window ignoring the screaming and freaked out girl in my room, I landed on the wet grass and twisted my ankle "OUCH" I shouted in pain, the boy froze and turned around but he was so far that I couldn't recognize his face. He stood in his place looking at me then at the opened gate, it seemed like he was thinking weather to come and check on me or escape, he stepped a bit closer then ...
"Leena are you Okay ?" Elina came running from the back door, she met my Admirer's face "STOP" But he didn't respond for sure and he ran away, Elina followed him until he reached the wooden fence and moved some peaces of wood, he was so fast and she couldn't catch him.
That's how he could get in without being caught ! He has made a secret door in the fence.
"Th-That boy must've been in the Olympics" Elina breathed heavily.
"Don't worry, I'll get him one day" I tried to stand up but failed, besides, who jumps out of a window from the second floor to chase a psycho ?
Cool, opened head and a twisted ankle ... What's next ???
