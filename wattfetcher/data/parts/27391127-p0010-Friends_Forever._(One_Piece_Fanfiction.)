"Yosh. I'm on Aya 's side so Haruka you can die in a hole somehere." Sakura stated hugging Aya.
"Oi! " Haruka shouted drawing his swords.
"Shishishishi. I want to play against Saki-chan."
"I'm not going to even bother. " Sakura whispered.
"Oi. Haruka, you owe me another showdown. " Zoro said smirking.
"Challenge accepted. " Haruka answered smirking back.
"I wanna see Aya -chwan play! "Sanji exclaimed doing his noodle dance.
"Is that the only reason? " Aya asked.
"I wanna play too." Ace asked.
"Ace-kun, you can't play." Nami said in a sweet voice. Ace was just looking at her expecting something to happen. "YOU'LL BURN ALL THE BALLS!!"
A little while later...
"Why the hell am I on the same with you"
"Because Aya put us here."
"True that."
'So guys, we're gonna win!" Aya exclaimed fist-pimping.
"We're gonna lose. The Monster Trio is over there you know." Haruka pointed.
"Good luck!" Chopper shouted as the two teams took their places on either side of the net.
"We need it."
Robin was the umpire and everybody except Kid was watching.
The rules of the game:  There are no rules.
Robin threw the ball for Sanji 's side and Zoro was quick to get it in the air.
Sanji:  Collier Shoot.
With that,  Sanji sent Luffy flying in air then
Luffy:  Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.
And the ball came down with an incredible speed.
"No fair."
"This game has no rules.' Haruka stated.
"The why not say so earlier?" Aya stated. With that, she perfectly stopped the ball with one leg and her upper body balancing vertically ontop the sand with one arm
"So cool.'' Chopper awed. Aya let loose a little sigh and kicked the ball to Haruka.
Haruka moving his hands in an 'z' shape in extreme slow motion sent the ball to the other side in the speed of light and just like that, they scored a point.
"C'est belle no..I mean, YOU GUYS ARE FREAKING MONSTERS!!!!!!!!"
"At least we scored a point didn't we?" Aya said giving a slight chuckle.
"Aya-chwan, you're so beautiful!"
"Damn pervert."
"Shut up!"
"I really wanna see Saki-chan attack.' Luffy stated cracking his knuckles. Sakura blushed a bit before going into deep thought. It just so happened that at that specific moment in time, Kid turned around and finally started looking at the game.
" I would love too but...Y'ALL COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE BALL TO BEGIN WITH!" Sakura shouted pointing to the area where the ball 'supposedly landed'.
"Its true. There's only a black spot." Usopp noted.
