It all started when Beyonce showed up on the bunker's doorstep.
When Dean opened the door, pistol in hand, he didn't even know how to react.
"B-Beyonce?" Dean asked. "What?"
"I believe her name is Be Once, Dean," Beyonce said, very un-Beyonce like.
It took a moment, but it dawned on Dean eventually. "Cas?"
Beyonce - er, Castiel - smiled. "Hello, Dean."
"What. The hell. Is happening."
"I met some very unkind witches," Cas began explaining. "Well, one of them was kind of nice. There were three, and they did something to Jimmy. The nicer one told me that this vessel," he gestured to himself, "would probably be willing."
"Beyonce, Cas? Beyonce is your vessel?"
"Dean, I truly believe her name is Be Once."
Dean sighed.

During the next couple days, Dean realized how much he actually loved Jimmy as Cas' vessel. Beyonce was a terrible vessel for Cas.
For one, he(she?) wouldn't stop saying that her name was Be Once. Beyonce was not the right height and that was bad. She didn't have bright blue eyes, she didn't have dark enough hair, she didn't have a dick. Basically, she wasn't Jimmy Novak.
At least she could sing pretty good.
Turns out, the spell was pretty easy to reverse. They fixed Jimmy, and once Cas was nice and snug inside again, he dropped Be Once off to Jay-Z, and said a simple "no questions asked." Which was only a little creepy.
The very second they were back at the bunker, Dean basically jumped on Cas, kissing every part of him he missed.
Every. Part.

I'm sorry that was short and sucky but once you see Castiel as Beyonce, your mind goes in many different directions and it's a little overwhelming.
