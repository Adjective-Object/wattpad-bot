I try to understand myself from your point of view.
But I can't.
I try to honestly tell myself that you see me differently.
But I can't.
I try to calm myself down.
But I can't.
I try to tell myself I'll be good and mean it.
But I can't.
I can't.
I can't do much.
And this isn't even the best of it yet.
I'd like to go on and explain it all.
But I can't.
