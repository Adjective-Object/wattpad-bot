Bonnie POV
High school wasn't at all fun, in Bonnie's opinion. She only enjoyed one class, English. Mostly because her teacher let the class have 15 minutes of free reading, and every once in a while, let them have a whole class of free write.
Writing is Bonnie's passion, considering her dream of being an author.
She never really thought of anything else but stories. In math, she was always caught for writing story ideas down in the back of her math notebook. In history, Bonnie always took those ideas and spaced out, while writing them in her head as a rough draft.
But Bonnie is a good student. Straight A's and perfect attendance each semester, except for the first semester in freshman year, when she caught the stomach flu from the kid who sat next to her in math, Gregory Danner. She hasn't looked at him the same ever since.
Bonnie also has a weird habit of picking at her eyebrows while she tries to think of a story idea. No, her eyebrows are not gone now, but for some reason, she always comes up with something while doing it.
Bonnie really doesn't have any friends who hang out with her and call her every day, or anything like that. She just maybe has people she sits next to in class and has befriended, but no people who would stick with her until the end of the earth.
In her free time, if she wasn't writing, Bonnie was strumming her guitar. Acoustic or electric, it didn't matter. She could play amazing songs on either. Bonnie said to herself, "If I wasn't so shy, I would do a song for the end of school talent show. But i am shy, so forget about it Bonnie."
If you already thought Bonnie's personality was strange, wait until you hear about her appearance. She has the most mesmerizing mauve eyes, and very strange purple highlights in her dark brown hair, that just grow back if they're cut.
Bonnie's family is big. She has one sister, and two brothers, along with a mom, a dad, and a dog. Her sister is named Luna, her brothers Corey and Jack. And her dog's name is Sparky. ( >:-] )
Now that we've told you about Bonnie the author, let's move into the biggest musical prodigy of the school....
