Why.....
Its always someone of high value. It couldnt be some lonely farm boy who got turned into a werewolf. It had to be the first werewolves son...
Andy had walked ahead of me for a while not saying anything. I had my own time to gather my thoughts and feelings. Paris was still on my mind and the thought of Ashley never finding me ever was an idea of freedom. He stopped and looked back at me.
"You dont have to follow me." He said. I kicked the ground.
"Andy you cant push me away right now." I said approaching him. He looked at the ground. I rolled my eyes and walked away from him. I found a spot to sit down. I heard a snap close by and I started to pick up a different scent. Then a werewolf crepted out of the woods and walked towards me. It roared a loud roar and shook ita hair and bared its teeth. I kept calm and sat there. The werewolf transformed back to its real body.
"Hello." I say softly. He looked at me without a sound.
"Usually our leader doesn't really like us talking to vampires.... You are a vampire right?" He asked me.
"Ive started to avoid them of recent because of my finac√® is different. Im just afraid of what he might do..." I say.
"Oh well if you want you can be safe with me." He said and moved a little closer. I could sense Andy was nearby.
"Theres someone else." I say quickly and stand up. He transformed and started to sniff around. Andy appears in werewolf form and growls. I look at Andy then at the other werewolf.
"Stop its okay." I say to Andy. Both werewolves transform back to human form.
"Whos this?" Andy asks me.
"I'm Kellin and who the hell are u?"
"Andy." He replies with a angry tone. I walk towards Andy.
"We are just passing though." I say grabbing Andys arm. Kellin sighed and looked down.
"Im afraid I have to tell my leader. You can come with me and im sure he would let you pass." Kellin said. I looked at Andy. I could tell he wasnt happy about this.
"How far?" Andy says. Kellin smiles and looks at me.
"Follow me."
