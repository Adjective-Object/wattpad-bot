No Christian
" christian" I whispered again then got grabbed and pulled me into a dark room and I  went to scream  but someone covered my mouth and I brought my knee and kneed  them  and they fell to the floor in pain I turned the light on and  saw a  crying out in help  christian on the floor holding his manhood for dear life
" my god christian you scared me to death " I said trying not to laugh but at the same time I felt bad that I kneed him  I got on my knees beside him and helped him up
" I'm so sorry " I said laughing but trying to be serious he nodded and tried to stand up straight .He walked out the closet  then I came out real fast  and bumped into someone
" hey I'm so sorry" I laughed looking up to see who I bumped into
" oh its you "  I said with a smirk
" yes its only your wonderful boyfriend he said sarcastically looking down at me
" whatever you say " I walked away after patting his chest softly  then leaving him behind me as I searched for christian. I looked around till I found him in a seat with a bag of ice then I just wanted to laugh again .
Airports have ice?
" sorry christian  I .. You scared me " I shuttered laughing a bit
"  Kylie can you walk me to get a snack " he smiled
" babe " justin started to sayput christian grabbed me by the hand and pulled me to the snack machine dropping his ice in the process
" christian " I giggled when he came to a stop
" what " he said pushing money in the coin slot  then scanning the machine for junk food
"   about the other day at the park " I started    then christian grabbed my arm and pulled me to the corner
" continue " he said narrowing his eyes
"  it was a mis..." I started to say but christian cut me out by crashing his lips with mine i surprisingly found myself  kissing back and he pulled me in the room we were in earlier so we could continue this I found my hands pulling and the end of his hair and tugging it slightly  and he deepened the kiss and  making my back hit the wall  behind me I smirked through the kiss . He pulled away from me
" I can't continue this anymore he's my best friend  your his girlfriend and this is wrong  I can't sneak around like this  " he  said gasping for air  I kissed him on the cheek and walked out  .Justin came up to me and christian came up behind him and pushed the b then the 1 then the 2 and a honeybun fell out the bottom he collected it then left to sit down.
Justin turned to me and smiled before pecking me on the lips then he backed up Concern filled my face does he know  oh god then the announcer came  on the intercomand told us to board our plane.
