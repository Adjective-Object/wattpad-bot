"How may I assist you today?" Aya asked nicely, her ears deciding to pop out at that particular moment.
"Yes, I'd like a latte please, if you don't mind." Doflamingo asked looking at the menu quickly even though he already knew what was there.
"Hai!" Aya answered cutely walking towards Sanji and placing the order. Her head dropped to the tile counter and she muttered some words under breath until the order came out and Aya delivered it to him.
As she was about to walk away, Doflamingo stopped her and requested her to stay by his side, to which she unwillingly complied.
"This latte is really good. Give my regards to the chef." Doflamingo said nicely.
"U-Um, I will." She stuttered a bit. Her ears were still there and Doflamingo took advantage of one of her many weak spots. Apparently, there is a specific spot behind her ears where she'd practically lose it.
Doflamingo took advantage of this (as he is the only one to know that exact spot) scratched Aya behind her ear. She became like a cat when you rub underneath its neck and she started to purr...literally and her tail started waving like a dog.
"You gotta be shitting me." Law muttered, seeing his friend's reaction. Poor Sakura and Nami had a hard time holding Sanji as he going to beat the hell outta Doflamingo seeing as he is breaking the number one rule, 'No touching of the maids in any way, shape or form.'
"Fufufu~ Now I want you to give me a massage. My back being killing me this week."
"You gotta be freaking kidding me!" Anything, You'd like Master~" Aya chirped. Doflamingo took off his extravagent coat and allowed Aya to massage his back. (Of course he still had his shirt on)
"You could massages from the maids?" The regualr male customers exclaimed, then died from nosebleeds from the thought of being massaged.
"What pervs."
"That was most enjoyable Aya. Here is my tip and I hope the rest of your day is fine."
"Thank you, Young Master-sama~" Aya sang as Doflamingo walked out of the caf√©.
As soon as he was out of earshot..
"THAT BASTARD!" Aya exclaimed, throwing her tray on the ground. "I wish I could die." She cried, slumping to the floor.

End of this chappy. Damn this was long. 3,982 words. Nice.
Ace: Sakura-chan, your guest is here.
Sakura: Oh thank you Ace. Bring him in. How was this chapter Aya?
Aya:You are so getting glittered.
Haruka: Not that again.
Luffy: What happened?
Sakura: Because of last chapter's events, when +kerriana88 came to school, she got her revenge by glittering me. And +grace9550 didn't know what was going on so she (yes Haruka is a girl in reality) decided to glitter me too and..
Aya: Pfft...
Haruka: Stop laughing, This isn't fucking funny!
Sakura: I ran by the next class and it was windy and +grace9550 sent an entire glitter capsule at me and the wind made the glitter do a 360 degrees turn and all fell on her.
Everyone: *burst out laughing and some rolling on the floor*
