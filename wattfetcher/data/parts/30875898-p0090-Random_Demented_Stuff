Just another razor
Just another drop of blood
Just another pocket knife
Just another red flood
Just another broken heart
Just another endless night
Just another nightmare
Just another scar out of sight
Just another day full of pain
Just another depressed night
Just another reason for the blade
Just another way to get a fright
Just another bitter beer
Just another abyss of fear
Just another salty tear
But you still don't know what I feel
