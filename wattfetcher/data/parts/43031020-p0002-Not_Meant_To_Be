I don't know why, but something about him made my heart speed up and the fox inside me excited. But if he was my mate, it would be forbidden.
I muttered an excuse, something about a period and left my book on the table and walked to the bathroom. I looked at my self in the mirror. I looked the same in the morning, rusty wavy hair, green eyes, pale skin.
I splashed my face with water and looked back up again. Still the same. I consulted my fox.
"What is wrong with me?" I asked her.
"I don't know, but I felt a rush of tingles when we saw Carl," was all my fox could say.
"Do you know why?" I asked.
"Maybe because, I don't know, he's your mate?" She said.
No...

Carl's P.O.V
The Alpha's daughter looked... Pretty. Like not the stunning noticeable pretty. To me she was the quiet pretty.
She sat down next to me and started reading her book. I coughed. "Yes what is it?" She asked, not looking up.
"Uh..." Good start loser "My names Carl and uh..." Get on with it! "I'm the packs Alpha son! And you are..?" Really lame...
"Hazel, Alpha daughter," she replied, looking up this time. She had nice green eyes under her glasses. I smiled widely.
She went back to reading and her face slightly screwed up. "Excuse me I have to go to the bathroom, I think I'm bleeding," she muttered and left.
I shook my head and listened in on my Dads and the fox alphas conversation. "... Well why are your Wolves on my territory?" Hazels dad growled.
"Well why is your territory so big?" My dad asked. "Because it can be? And can you not smell our markers?"
My dad growled. "You got a point there." My eyes slowly drifted out a window, and the only thing that caught my eye was a fox running away.
"Hey um, Hazels dad..." I said. "Yea?" He answered. "Is that your daughter running away there?" I asked.
He looked out the window and cursed. "Please excuse me as I get my daughter," he muttered and left the table. "I'm going to go to the bathroom," I stood up left.
I climbed through the bathroom window outside and instantly my wolf senses kicked in. I followed her scent and shifted into a wolf, running where ever Hazel had gone off too.
What did I do wrong..?
