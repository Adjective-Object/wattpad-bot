"It's the way the cookie crumbles, you both are destined to fall madly in love!" Alexis voice rings in my ears as she ran around my closet looking for something."I am not his mate! He is a monster!", I pull her arm bringing her back into my hold giving her a pleading look, she quickly shakes off her guilt and replaces her frown with a smirk. "A hot monster!", her voice is so cheerful it makes me sick.•••"Maria, no matter what happens tonight you'll always be my little girl!". My moms voice brings me out of my thoughts and I look up at her. She's dressed in her long red dress with matching red shoes, her hair is straight and shiny. I just smile as a response knowing whatever will happen tonight will change everything. Tonight's the night, the night me and Luke finally, officially talk. The day I met Luke was the day my dad left my mom. He didn't tell anyone why he left but he did! I still don't know how you can meet your mate and leave them!     I remember that night like it was yesterday. I felt like I was in a trance everything felt different. My wolf (Monica), was going crazy, and wanted me to go downstairs. I did know whoever was down there was my mate, but once his eyes met mine, I wish I didn't. I regret walking down those stairs every day of my life. He told me he'd be back once I turned twenty. Never once did I think time would fly this fast.       •••        Luke's large figure towers over me. He doesn't say a word and his expression is blank. I moved away from him, leaning back onto the table in the large room.  After I Growled loudly his head shot up in shock.    Oh god. What did I get my self into now?!?
