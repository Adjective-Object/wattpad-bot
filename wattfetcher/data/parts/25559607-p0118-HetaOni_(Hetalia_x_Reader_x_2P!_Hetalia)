He turned to face me with hopeful eyes. "R-Really, poppet?"
"Yes, really." I replied, giving him a sincere smile.
"But...we're in this...situation..." he said sadly.
"...Y-Yeah..."
"______...poppet...if...if this 'game' had a good ending for everyone...or rather...if this game never happened at all, would you accept me as your friend?" he asked me shyly.
My eyes widened at his question. "Actually...we could be friends right now." I told him.
"W-We can? But..but we've been such meanies to you..." he stated.
"....I believe in giving second chances. Beyond the insanity...you're always willing to make the people you care for smile. And you don't swear, which is rare--but good. You guys may think that just because you were banished no one would like you, but I beg to differ. If you promise not to hurt innocent people, it'd make me happy. Would you...like to be friends, Ollie?"
Olivers eyes started welling up as his lips trembled. "Poppet! I'd love to!!", he exclaimed, pulling me into a tight hug.
I patted his back to soothe him. "Ollie...why are you crying..?"
"My apologies, poppet... I just...I'm really happy." he said, sniffling in between his words.
"Well, I'm happy you're happy." I told him. He pulled away from our hug and spoke, "I'd celebrate this moment with cupcakes--but I'm all out of them."
"Cupcakes...AH! T-The others! The others are..!!" I suddenly panicked upon remembering the dangers following Italy and the other 1Ps.
Oliver lowered his head. "I'm sorry, poppet. They're already downstairs... Allen probably gave Steve the cupcake already, too... Once the alien kills the Italian 'First Player'...they'll go after the others who are conveniently locked inside the cell."
"No....I--I have to go there! I have to--help..." I said frantically.
I waved my hand in front of me and saw a screen appear.
///
The screen showed Italy, being ambushed by a monster thrice as large as the usual ones. The Italian was slowly stepping backwards.
"Ts??!!
Oh
...
Ger--ma--"
///
"ITALY!!" I shouted, seriously worried about the man about to get attacked by the alien-like monster.
Oliver placed a hand on my shoulder. "Poppet..."
"Ollie...wh-what...what do I do?? I...I can't just...I-I can't just stay here and do nothing!" I cried.
I rushed towards the door and tried turning the knob, tears were flowing down my cheeks. "I-I need...I need to get o-out...and s--..." I suddenly stopped.
"...._____? Poppet..?" Oliver asked, confused as to why I froze all of a sudden.
"....My....parents..." I muttered.
"Oh..."
"No. No. No! Italy's in danger! The others are in danger! But...but! If I try to help...m-my parents..will...they'll be...." I fell to my knees and sobbed.
I don't know what to do. I'm torn between doing two things that I know I should do. Should I? Should I not? What else can I do? Is there another way? How will I get out? How? What? AH!!!
