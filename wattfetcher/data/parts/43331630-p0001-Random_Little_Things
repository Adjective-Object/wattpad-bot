Hey guys, my name is Ellie. The reason why I decided to create this is because I'm bad at updating other books because I don't feel confident about my writing. I feel like it isn't that great and that it needs work. For now, I'm just going to make something that I'm comfortable with writing. I'm practically writing a journal, this journal will consist of many things; experiences, rants, poetry, short stories and just very random stuff. (: Since I'm not an offensive person (or I try not to be) I will try to make it seem not offensive, but everyone has an opinion on some things which I totally understand. I'm only writing what I enjoy(: Thanks for everything! Xx
