Later that evening I was talking to my friend Maddy and she was obsessing over her new boyfriend Reese. Her and Reese had been a on and off thing for months now and they had just shared there first kiss and Maddy was totally obsessed about him. But anyway I got a face time call from Melissa and she started yelling (again). I finally calmed her down and we started talking about when, where and what Melissa was going to wear. "Omg May I am so happy. So tell me how's Jay?" She said as Melissa winked at me through my phone. Ok so I kinda have a crush on this guy in my English class but I won't bore you with his amazingness. Anyway we talked all though the night and we finally decided what Melissa would wear to her first date!!
