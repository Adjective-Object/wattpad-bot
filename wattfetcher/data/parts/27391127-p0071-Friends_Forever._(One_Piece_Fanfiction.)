"Why the hell is the Marimo here?"
"Hello, the great Captain Usopp, has arrived!
"Yay! The the great Captain Usopp!"
"Yohohoho! Aya-san, Can I see your panties?"
"Now WHY would she do that!"  Nami yelled.
"This is one SUPER  restaurant."
"I hope you enjoy it Franky."
"NO WAY! ALL YOU SHITTY RUFFIANS GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THESE MARVELLOUS- OI!" Sanji started being interrupted by the fact that the 'ruffians' were served.
Aya served Luffy at Table 16. Sakura served Brook at Table 20, Nami served Usopp at Table 17. Vivi served Chopper at Table 3 and Robin served both Zoro and Franky at Tables 11 and 1 respectively.
"More food! More food Aya!"
"Hai, Master." Aya answered sweetly smiling a bit before retrieving more food.
"I swear this is hell all over again." Sanji muttered practically frying 4 pans of pancakes at the same time.
"Ne, Vivi?" Chopper called.
"Hai master. "
"Can you write on the rice for me?"
"Okay." On the rice, Vivi wrote, " You are very cute, Tony-kun."
"Baka, that doesn't make me happy, asshole." Chopper sang dancing.
"What would you like, Master Brook?" Sakura sang.
"Yohoho, maids are the best. But, may I see your panties."
"Um, I wonder what colour I have one today?"
"Ah, you are very bold, Saki-san!"
"This the life." Zoro sighed, drinking sake.
"You're a SUPER maid, Robin."
"Thank you."
"WHY THE HELL ARE THESE RUFFIANS GETTING ROYAL TREATMENT!" Sanji exploded.
A little while later...(Have you ever heard of the Straw Hats leaving in a hurry? Don't answer that.)
The Straw Hat were still enjoying themselves expect for Franky and Brook who left because they had to attend to important business. Customers were coming and caf√© was ten times as busy as it usually is.
"We have a lot of visitors today, Sanji-kun." Nami noted, feeling exhausted from being nice to pervy eyes for the morning.
"Yes it is but its okay as long as my mellorine loves are here~ <3"
"Why is the Ero-Cook the chef? His food tastes like crap."
"Because he really like cooking, Zoro."
"Or that he likes being pervy at the beautiful maids." Zoro said with his eyes closed.
"Thanks for the compliment, Master~" Robin sang. When Zoro realized what he said, his cheeks had some pink dusting it and he turned his head.
"Did Zoro just blush?"
"He lllllllllliiiikkes her~" Sakura teased.
"WHAT THE HELL? I CAN HEAR YOU!" Zoro shouted at the teasing girls. That only made them laugh more. "STOP LAUGHING!"
"Yo!" A certain Flame head called sitting at Table 5.
