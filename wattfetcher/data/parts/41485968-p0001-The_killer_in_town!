Hii my name is jeff the killer. I am a strong independent young man. I am 15 years old. I use to go to Rideway highschool. But I dropped out after Freshman year. I was bullied my whole life and it never ended. so I decided that I was going to make a change in my life. Since I was never happy I decided to carve a smile into my face so I could atleast pretend to be happy. And after that I wanted to get revenge so I started killing people for a living. And then comes Slendar man. Hello my name is Slendar man . I am very tall and slendar of course. I live alone in the woods close to Rideway highschool where my friend Jeff the killer use to go . I am a very smart. And when people trespass my woods/ my home I think it is fun to scare them and sometimes I might even kill them it gives me this kind of thrill when I kill people. When I was younger I use to live in a foster home where my foster parents abused me . And then I excaped and started plotting for revenge.... ( HAHA) And lastley. Hey my name is D.j. I am 14 years old . I am a brillant young girl. I am very creative I love building things and comeing up with new ideas . And I am currently living on the streets of New York. My parents got divorced so they kicked me out of the house and that's how I got here. But no worries I am ok it is better for me to be alone so I don't have to worry about getting hurt again.
