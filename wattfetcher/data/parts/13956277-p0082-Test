I walked to school expecting a huge amount of action and drama especially that 2 people want me dead ... Miley and Conor.
"Hey" Diana appeared out of nowhere, "Goodmorning" I hugged her, "Listen Leena, be careful, Miley is after something, we heared about the fight, Conor it bruised from head to toe" I see that news gets spread in a blink, "And I'm ready".
I stopped when I saw Simon who stumbled when he saw me, "Hi" I said, "Hello, how are you today" He combed his hair with his fingers, "I'm fine alhamdulillah, I just want to thank you for what you did yesterday, I didn't get a chance to thank you" I was lowering my gaze but I knew that he was staring and smiling, "No need, I did what I was supposed to do, Is it better know ? I can check it if you want ne to", "Yes it's bettet and No I'm fine, thanks again, see you around, bye" I left him standing beside his locker when I noticed his sister walking toward us, "Stop Leena, I'm talking to you, don't ignore me", "What ? What do you want ?" I said coldly, "When you saw me and Tom in the room alone, it wasn't like what you think", "What was it then ?" I raised an eyebrow, "It's complicated, I'll tell you later", "You better have a good reason".
I got into math class and saw Miley sitting beside Conor ... WHAT ? "Time to pay back" He whispered to me, this is not good. I put my bag on the floor and sat in my seat but as soon as I became comfortable, it collapsed like Lego ! I fell on the groung and people around me started laughing out loud, "You should lose some weight" Miley mocked, I wanted to punch her face, "Get up" Tom extended his hand offering help, but I ignored him and got up on my own. As soon as I stood up, I felt sharp pain in my leg, I pulled my long skirt a little and saw a piece of wood sticking out of my leg, "Are you hurt dummy ?" Conor laughed, the teacher got in and I asked him for a premission to visit the nurse, I felt my phone viberate in my pocket but I was busy trying to walk without making the sharp piece of wood stick in more.
.....
I went to my locker to get my English books and surprise, my books are drowning in orange juice and half of my things are missing ... Miley and Conor ! Who else could it be ?
I walked to my English class empty handed, "Leena, where are your books ?" The teacher asked, "I'm drying them because someone accidently *glares at Conor* dropped orange juice over them", "You can have mine", "Thanks Jake I can go through this class without books" I kept my eyes on the teacher who started talking right after I became silent.
I walked to my locker but tripped over something and almost fell, it's Conor's leg "Watch were you step" His friends laughed, "Watch where you leave your legs" two seconds after I said this phrase I felt coldness hit me, I was drowning in orange juice, "Astaghferollah" I did my best to hold myself and not break some of his bones, "Want a straw ?" It was Jake, I knew he won't play the 'loverboy' role forever, but what the ?!?!
"Told you before, nobody rejects Jake Mark neither insults him" Everybody started laughing at me, I was going to beat both of these boys hp but they're lucky I was busy running to the bathroom to wash my skirt before it becomes sticky.
"Ghabiy, qaleelol adab" I whispered while I was in the restroom trying to clean myself but it didn't work, my whole outfit became sticked to my body, there was no way I'd get out like this, I get bullied and flirting in my over-sized clothes, what will happen if I get out like this, sticky and sweet ? I do not even want to know the answer.
"Take" A bag was thrown at my face, I couldn't see who threw it because the girl got out quickly. I opened the bag and saw prayer clothes and a praying carpet ! I put the prayer clothes on after I took off my skirt , al hamdulilah the tight pants I wore under it. I was about to close the bag but I found a notebook too, I knew that I wasn't supposed to peek but I was so anxious to know whose bag and things are those, I opened the notebookÂ  'Hannah <3' It said.
