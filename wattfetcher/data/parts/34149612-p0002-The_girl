The day started out as any normal day with my mom stumbling in around 2 o'clock in the morning breaking things and cursing at the table for running into her leg like she does everynight I rush out to help her before she.breaks anything else "mom stop before you break something besides a vase like I don't know your ankle then we'll never be able to pay rent" I say in a huff.

"I love you to mom" I say placing a glass of water and two advils on her desk and walking out
