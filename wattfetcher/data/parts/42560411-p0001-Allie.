I clutched my mothers hand, watching the monitor of her heart beat get slower and slower. I let silent tears fall down my cold cheeks, not wanting to sob in front of her. I watched her face start to pale, and I couldn't help but let out a small sniffle. My mother was dying. The woman who gave me life was fading away into the past.
"My baby.." she whispers, looking over at me. Her brown simple eyes still had the twinkle in them from when I was little. She only had it when she looked at me, and it made me feel so special.
"My beautiful girl" she says, her voice cracking. I didn't care about the doctors, nurses, or any other person in the room, I was only focused on my mother.
"Momma" I can't help but sob.
"How was your date?" she asks, faintly smiling.
I let out a dry laugh "He was full of himself, wasn't my type at all" I blink.
Her eyes start to flutter shut, I started to realize that she had minutes left.
"Please, mom" I whisper, "Don't go, I have nobody else, I'm only 18, with no father or family, I can't do this-I can't do this without you."
"Yes you can" she breathes, "You'll never be without me, I'll always be with you."
"It's not the same" I cry.
"My angel, your not going to be alone forever" she states.
"Yes, you're the only person I've ever loved, I would never love somebody else if this is how love always ends."
I break my gaze from her, looking down at the floor while kneeing against the hospital bed.
"Look at me" she murmurs. I do ask she asks, staring at her strong eyes.
"One day you'll find love, he'll be much better than any guy you've gone out with, he'll make you smile at the littlest things, you'll know he's the one, trust me, Allie."
I stare at her, watching her desperate hope of her words will get to my heart.
"Ok" I finally say.
"I love you" she smiles, her eyes finally shutting, her chest barely moving.
"I love you more" I shake as her body stops moving and her heart completely stops, leaving me completely and utterly shattered.
