Depression is like so many different things. Depression is like a shark, it rips you apart limb by limb only to realize you're not what it thought you were. Depression is like an alligator, it'll lock you in a death roll so you can't kill it. Depression is like a deer, it runs back and forth and back and forth so you can't hunt it down. Depression is like a lion, it's something you don't want to mess with and it can scare everyone with a simple sound. Depression is like so many different things. It's like you, it's like me... Depression is actually like, everyone and everything.
