"Please continue, Ms. Hamilton," he said.
Jane blinked. Holy shit! He knew her name? She cleared her throat. "Yes, of course, sir." She turned and led to the center of the stage. They were as the end of the raised runway when Jane's phone insistently rang. "Sorry, sir," she said apologetically. She turned and hastily turned on the phone. "Hello?"
"Jane, it's me, Sakura."
Jane bit her lip and peeked up at Sebastian. "Where are you? Are you lost or something? Did you get that list from the wardrobe assistant?"
"I did. Where are you? I'm bringing it over."
"I'm in the great hall on the first floor where the show is going to take place. Come quick. I have to get that list to Chris before he kills me."
Jane heard her friend laughed. "It's your fault, Jane. Now who said she's very organized."
"Don't tease me. Not at this time. Please hurry."
"All right. On my way."
Jane sighed and hung up. "Sorry about that, sir. It was work." She gave him another apologetic smile.
Sebastian simply nodded.
Jane phone rang again. She grunted under her breath and. "Sorry, sir," again to Sebastian.
Take your time," he said, walking away from her to inspect the stage.
Jane sighed in relief and turned her attention to her phone. "Yes?"
"Jane? Where the heck are you?"
Jane grunted under her breath. It was Adam Somerville, the backstage manager. She muttered under breath and then said nicely into the phone, "I'm with Mr. Princeton, Adam. What do you want?"
"Showing him around, are you? Why didn't they ask me to show him around instead?"
Jane thought he sounded pissed. So he should be since he just loved to rub shoulders with the rich and famous. She took a bit of delight at the thought that he had missed out. "Did you want me for something?"
"Come backstage for a minute, will you? I need you here."
"Okay. Be there in a sec." She hung up and rushed to Sebastian, who was busy staring up at the lights.
"Sir?"
Sebastian turned to her. "Hum?"
"I have to go backstage for a second. I'll be right back."
"Take your time," he replied, dismissing her.
Jane nodded and rushed away, her feet light on the carpeted floor.
Alone, Sebastian continued to look around him, though his mind was elsewhere.
Sakura! He thought. The music was to be Sakura, Sakura. A song depicting spring and love.
Clung! And then blackness.
Sebastian blinked. What just happened? Why was the whole place suddenly flooded with darkness?
"Oi! What the hell is going on there?" He heard a man shouted.
"Yeah, where's the light?" Another yelled.
"Sorry!" A voice echoed through the speaker phone. "We're just testing the lights. Please be patient. It'll only take a moment."
