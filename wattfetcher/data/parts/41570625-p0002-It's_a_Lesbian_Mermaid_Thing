Erin grinned. "I didn't spend all that time in the closet for nothing."
Yeah, Erin was as gay as the Forth of July. Erin was also the great-great-great grandson of Fredrick Wingston. He's the most popular gay in town. Even if you didn't like it, people respected him for his ancestry. I, however, was second most famous gay in Wingston Harbor. So, as expected as the only two gays in Wingston Harbor, our friendship was pretty awesome. Mom would even let him spend the night sometimes, but we have to sleep on the couch.____________
Everyone at school was talking about the party tonight. The Summer Fuse was for all the high schoolers as a way to kick off the summer. The whole reason we were still even going to school was because this stupid school had to make our exams the last few days to make sure we actually come.
"Are we going to the Summer Fuse?" I asked Erin.
Erin turned to face me, with his eyebrows raised. "I didn't think you wanted to go. Do you?"
"Yeah," I shrugged, "I thought you would want to. It's your big chance to make-out with Devon!"
Erin gave a goofy grin. "That is a very good reason. I guess you know what this means."
"What?"
"We're going to go shopping."
"No!" I groaned.
"Yes!" Erik imitated my voice.
"Why do we have to?"
"Because, you're still wearing bath suits from two years ago."
When I opened my mouth to protest, Erin put his hand over it. I immediately stuck my tongue out, and started to lick his hand. Erin blew air out of his nose, making him sound like an irritated dog.
"Licking my hand does nothing to defeat me. You need new bathing suits and we ARE going shopping for them. Right after school we'll go to the Surf Shop. Okay?"
"Okay," I said, but it came out muffled by his hand.
The bell rang for first period. Erin pulled his hand away and started towards his World History class.
"Good luck!" I yelled.
"See you in the flip side," Erin called over his shoulder.
I smiled and shook my head. Erin was such a loser.
