Hello everyone! Today we will be having grammar lessons.
We will start with you're and your.
You're is short for you are.Your shows that something belongs to "you" or is related to "you" (e.g., your car, your father).
The word your sits before another word (usually a noun or a pronoun) to show that it belongs to "you" (e.g., your car, your arm), is of "you" (e.g., your picture, your photograph) or is related to "you" (e.g., your uncle).
Your is a possessive adjective. (Other possessive adjectives are my, your, his, her, its, our, and their.)
Thanks for tuning in~
