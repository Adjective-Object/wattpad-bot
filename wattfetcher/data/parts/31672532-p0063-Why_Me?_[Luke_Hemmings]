1. I'm sorry this isn't a real update2. I'm sooooo behind I know I haven't started writing yet3. School and work and FFA is making me hella busy right now4. Currently watching Beyonc√© in choir 5. I recommend Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard  you can buy it at B&N or 2nd & Charles or a book store near you! I give it a 4.5/5 6. Next week there will be an update so look forward to that!
