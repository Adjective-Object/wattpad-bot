*ARABELLA'S POV*Today's the day!The day I got adopted, If you're wondering. Yes I live in a foster home. So what. Hi! My name is Arabella, and I'm 14 years old living in a foster home in Los Angeles, California. I don't know who's adopting me, but I quickly changed into a floral crop top, blue skater skirt, and nude heels. I put on a few bracelets, a necklace, and pearl ear rings. I went out into the lobby and waited..."Arabella! The fat slut! Your person to adopt you is here! Thank god!" Said the worst person to own this foster home. Stacy. Ugh. This foster home is a poor foster home. They only feed us three crackers, and on a good day, three and a half. I went to the front lobby and saw a guy about twenty years old. "Hi! I'm Cameron Dallas and I'm your new dad!""Um hi. I'm Arabella!" I said shyly. I looked at my feet and fiddled with my bracelets. I stuck my hand out so he could shake it when he pulled me into a hug. I was scared at first but then I hugged him back. "Let's go!" Said Cameron. "Yes sir." I said to him. I haven't been out of the foster home in such a long time except to go out into the garden and pick the daisies. "You can call me cam, if you want." he said and smiled at me. "Um okay, cam." I said and smiled back at him. We got into the parking lot and I was surprised to see a black SUV? I don't know. I could tell that cam knew I was confused and he said,"its a long story. I'll tell you later." And I said okay....
