Jeff's POV
She kissed me? I mean, not on the lips, but she kissed me. I know I blushed, I feel like such an idiot.
What a pussy thing to do Jeff.
I hear a knock on the door. "Come in."
Lena walks in with sandwich. "Wow, I can see you got this done quickly, hm? " She smiles, looking at the corpse of Joana. Now without skin and dripping with blood.
"I suppose so." I grab the sandwich from her. "Thank you." I thank her before taking a bite. "What is this?"
"Bacon, lettuce, tomato.." She tells me and I spit in back on the plate. "I hate tomato."
"Oh, I'll make another one." She reaches for the plate but I pull away.
"You don't have to, I'll just take them off." I say, taking out the slices of red devil fruit this world calls a tomato."You're boring." I tell her.
"Hey.." She whines and crosses her arms. "Am not."
I chuckle. "Yes you are. You're too nice, it's like you don't have a personality. And it's really confusing considering when you are provoked you turn into a crazed killer."
She takes one of the discarded tomato slices from my plate and eats it. "Well, maybe that is my personality, sweetheart by day and murderer by night." Her small voice giggles and it's the cutest noise I've ever heard. "You don't have to be an asshole to be interesting."
"Do you have any hobbies? Hobbies would make you interesting." I ask her, eating my sandwich.
"Well I liked to draw for a while. I kind of never had time to do it after I got out of school." She tells me.
"What? Drawing doesn't take that long." I take my bloody finger and draw a smiley face on the wall. "See? Not that hard."
She laughs. "I'm kind of a perfectionist." She shrugs. "I like my drawings to be perfect, which means I'd spend hours drawing. I didn't have hours to sit around and draw after I started working."
"I have a couple of sketchbooks in my room." I tell her. "You can have those."
"You liked to draw too?" She asks me.
"I dabble."
She laughs and smiles at me. "Well, thank you."
I nod. "No problem."
"There's something I've been wanting to ask you." She tells me. Oh god, does she fell the same way I do? How relieved would I be if she did.
"Yes?" I ask, hiding my excitement.
"How do you pay for electricity? All a your food and furniture?" She asks me.
Dammit. "Well, I steal my electricity and water from the building on top of us, and I steal my food and furniture."
She looks a bit shocked but I roll my eyes.
"I'm a killer Lena, do you really thing I'm above theft?" I ask her.
"Good point." She nods. I notice a bit of tomato on the side of her lip.
"You have a little tomato.." I point to her face.
"Oh." She tries to get it off but keeps missing it.
"Here, let me." I use my thumb to wipe it off her. I don't know what to do with it, so I wipe it on her shirt.
She looks at her shirt then looks at me. "Really?"
We both burst out in laughter. Her laugh is just so.. entertaining. It's great, I love it.
