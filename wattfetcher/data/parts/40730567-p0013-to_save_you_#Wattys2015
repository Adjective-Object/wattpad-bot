just an author's note, please don't kill me.

so i just wanted to tell you guys that i'm going on a long almost 2.5 months vacation, starting 29 june. and i won't be taking my laptop with me, bc well i am going on a vacation.

so what i'm trying to say is that all my stories are on hold from now on (i might update if i get like an awesome idea or something). all stories, except this one. i will finish this story before i leave though. bc i dont want to keep y'all hangin.

so please don't kill me.

but i am going on a vacation. i'm going to england first, for like a week. thats where i was raised and stuff.

and then my next stop will be dubai, bc i was born there. and bc my dad has to do something related to property over there.

and then lastly, we are going to pakistan for 1.5 months bc there is a wedding. so if you have any questions or want to see pics of me during vacation, pm me for my snapchat.

love
cleo
