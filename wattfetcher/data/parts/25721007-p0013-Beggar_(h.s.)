I dropped my drink in complete shock. Nosy, drunk students all turned their heads in my direction. My cheeks switched to a crimson from embarrassment. Even Harry and Zayn stopped fighting to look my way.
I could either play casual and hang with Zayn again or I could freak out at Harry. The first option seemed best.. for now. I walked over to Zayn and started to slur, "I've been looking for you."
The alcohol was starting to take over my body.
The curly haired boy became tense and Zayn smiled, putting his arm around my shoulders making Harry fume with anger, "Sorry, I was just having a chat with Harry."
"Let's gooo back to the apartment," I blot. Zayn nods then looking back at Harry making him even more tense.
Once we reach the outside, the cold air hits me like a brick. I am relieved when Zayn covers me with his jacket since I'm wearing a dress. It's a cheesy, but nice gesture. I whisper a thank you before entering his truck.
"Good thing I'm more sober than you," he chuckles and I laugh along as we drove to the apartment.
Even though my brain cells were taken over by alcohol. I still had one thing on my mind, Harry. Were they talking about me or some other girl? Thousands of unanswered questions filled my mind. I had to ask.
"Zayn?" I chirped.
"Yeah?" he smiled. I love it how he's always so nice to me unlike someone I know.
"Who were you arguing about with Harry in there?" I spoke and Zayn frowned. He probably didn't expect me to ask.
"You saw the fight?" He asked, dodging my previous question. I looked over at him. He seemed nervous.
"Yes," I answered.
"Oh," he focused his attention back on the road. But, I wasn't done yet. He didn't reply to my question.
"Soo.."
"What?"
"Answer my question I asked earlier,"
"We were talking about you.. okay?" Zayn said. He almost seemed angry?
"You don't have to get all mad about it. It's just a simple question," I huffed in annoyance.
"Well there's just some things you don't need to know," he growled. His actions reminded me of Harry. He turned from sweet to rude all too quickly.
"Okay.." Was all I managed to say.

I haven't spoken to Zayn since his little freak out. As soon as we entered the apartment, I went to Niall's room. I know he probably won't be back tonight, but I really wanted to talk to him.
I pulled out my phone, I bought the other day, and dialed Niall's number.
"Lennon? Are you okay? I heard there was a fight of some sort?" He asked full of worry.
"Yeah I'm fine," I paused, "When are you coming back?"
"Um.. I'm not really sure. Why?"
"Could you please come back? I have to talk to you," I almost pleaded.
"Yeah, I'll be there in ten minutes," he replied on the other side of the line.
We said goodbye and I laid back on the bed. I'm so glad I have Niall to talk to. He's so sweet. He left the party for me.
Sooner than later, Niall was home.
"Hey Lennon," he smiled, his pearl, white teeth showing.
