(3 Years Ago)
"Percy!" I scream as I look over and run only to see my brother on the ground. He was badly injured and dying. "No no no you can't go you can't die!" I yell as I hold his body in my lap. "Alex listen to me you will do great, but you need to let me go." He said to me. "I can't." I said softly with tears running down my face. "Listen, you have too, I love you so much." he said using his last breath. Then there he lay as I start to cry Annabeth comes rushing over with eyes watering and starts to cry. We started back to camp and I thought if I should even go with them. It would be painful to watch his service, and it would be painful to stay so I decided to leave. I told Annabeth and the others then, I just left.
