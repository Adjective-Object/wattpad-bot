"Leena, wake up, we're in Jordan" Leena jumped and her head hit the window, I chuckled, "I'll see how you'll laugh when you understand nothing. We're in Jordan now, so from now on, I'll speak in Arabic, and I don't care if you won't understand me, because in your country I spoke your language, now in my country, I'll speak my language" She raised an eyebrow, "No ! Come on ! Please !" I frowned, "ابتعد قليلا، أريد أن أخرج لأن الطائرة قد هبطت" She said, "What ? Come on ! Please?" I begged,  "You'll do whatever I say and follow my own rules or I'll leave you alone in a place you know nothing about" She warned me, "Okay Okay fine" I put my hands up and surrendered.
We got out the plane and reached the checkpoint, "Rule number one, you don't know me, I don't know you, stay 10 feet away from me and get into another taxi an-", "Hold on ! What's all that for ?" I frowned, "Things are different here, this is not the US, there's no such thing called friendship between a male and a female, there's many things you won't be able to understand and I don't have time to explain everything because I have to go to the hospital immediately, Damon told me the name of the hospital they're staying in".
"Stay in the taxi" She said when we reached the hospital, "No, I want to come with you", "LOOK AT ME, the main reason my parents got into this place was because Damon told my father about you, I don't think it's a good idea for you to come" She left me in the taxi and got into the hospital, I couldn't wait, I just couldn't, I paid for the taxi, took the bags and kept them in the reception and followed her without her knowing it, she spoke to many nurses and of course I understood nothing.
Leena pushed a door and got into a room, I peeked through the door, only one body was there, a man, her father, his eyes widened when he saw her, he extended his hand to hold Leena's hand and told her something then the heart machine beeped, the line on it went straight, his hand dropped Leena hand, nurses rushed into the room, Leena took few steps back until her back bumped into the wall, they used electricity to heal his heart, but the beeping sound didn't stop and the line stayed straight. Leena screamed her laungs out, I ran to her and hugged her, she kept screaming and crying and punching my chest, "ONE SECOND, IF I COME ONE SECOND EARLIER I COULD'VE SEEN MY MOTHER TOO, ONE SECOND SIMON, JUST ONE", "رحمه الله nurse told Leena, I didn't understand what it meant but Leena screamed again and ran to her father, she hugged his no longer living body, I stood in my place watching her crashing and crying, I didn't know what to do, I just stood in the corner with my hands covering face, "ONE SECOND SIMON ! JUST ONE SECOND ! HE SAID HE CAN'T LIVE WITH OUT HER AND SHE SAID THAT THE ONLY THINK THAT CAN HEAL HER WAS ME, ONE SECOND ONLY", "Get up Leena" I tried to pull her away from her father because the nurses had to take him to another room, "أتركني" She said while kicking me, her kicks started getting weaker and weaker, the next thing I saw, was Leena lying on the floor with her eyes closed.
