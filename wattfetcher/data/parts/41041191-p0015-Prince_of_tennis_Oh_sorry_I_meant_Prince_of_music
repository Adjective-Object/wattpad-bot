Where were we oh yeah.

"Oh sorry Its just that Me and the rest of the students who are also in the exchange program are waiting outside and well yeah.Oh and our school is called seigaku"Said Evelyn cheerful. In Japanese or yeah well she is half-Chinese and half-Japanese so she had learned both languages from her parents but she Canadian down to the bone.But is is not good in speaking Japanese nor understanding since her mothers father was also Chinese so she more Chinese then Japanese but still.

"EHHHHHH"Everyone yelled except for  a few such as Fuji, Tezuka, Inui, Kaido, Atobe, Etc you get the point.


As soon as they have received the news all of the seigaku member's ran outside.

Once they have reached near the door they hear lots of chattering. Until..

"SORRY FOR BEING LATE WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE MET UP WITH US FROM INSIDE THE AIRPORT-oh HIIIIII MRS. DRAGONEEL" Yelled Ryuu. Oh yeah the kid knows the school.
