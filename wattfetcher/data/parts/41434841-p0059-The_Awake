I get the quicksand reference along with the gold one. However that doesn't exactly stop what will happen. I shouldn't let you hold on to whatever I've got going on here. I've been lying. A lot. I don't know if you'll read this but if you do, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you what was going on. I'm sorry I played it off like everything was fine. But here's some of the things I didn't tell you. My lawyer lost. I stabbed myself in the leg with a blade, shoved it near all the way in and ripped it out, I gave myself stitches but it got infected. I had a patch of raised scar tissue so I cut it off. I shouldn't have done that. I should've told you about the pills. I didn't overdose but I tried. I should've told you about the fights. I should've told you about so many things I just can't let you know. And I'm sorry. I have my own personal War and Peace of things I should've told you and things you'll probably never know. And it will die with me. Because even if I make it five days I'm not really staying. It was just to please you all. With my death will come pain, anger, and sadness. I could prevent it but I don't want to. Unless you're going to continue to hold on to a carcass you need to let me sink in the quicksand.
I'm sure I won't always feel this way but it's a backseat driver of an emotion. It's going to stick around. I'm sorry you didn't exactly know me for who I was. It's not fair that you didn't get to see me genuinely happy or when I enjoyed life, before all this shit I went through, you would've liked me a whole lot more. I'm sorry.
