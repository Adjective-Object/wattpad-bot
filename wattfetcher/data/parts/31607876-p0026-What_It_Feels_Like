"Once, I tried to commit suicide. My best friend came to visit me in the hospital. She said, 'I don't know what you were thinking, thinking I wasn't there for you. I'm always here for you.' But she wasn't. And I was angry. So I said to her, 'I kept a tally on my arms of all the times I needed you and you weren't there.' And she just started crying."
