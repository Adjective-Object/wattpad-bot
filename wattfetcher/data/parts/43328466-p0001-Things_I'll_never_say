"Carter is soooooo hot. I wish he'd notice me already!" Mady went on about her crush like usual as we paced down the long hall to our class. "I wonder if he's good in bed..." She said with an evil smirk on her face, I couldn't help but burst out in laughter. I was laughing hysterically when I noticed a group of grade sixes were staring at me like a had two heads or something. "dude, that kid is glaring at me." I whispered to Mady. "Ignore her." Mady replied, that just made that one girl look at me with an even meaner face. I didn't think much of it, just another kid...right? My year of grade seven just carried on like normal.
