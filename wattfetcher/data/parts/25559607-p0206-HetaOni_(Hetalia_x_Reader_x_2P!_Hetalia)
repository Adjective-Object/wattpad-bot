"......No....I.....I remember this.....I remember...." I softly muttered, my eyes widening.



This....this dream.....is....a memory...



My hands clenched the edge of the pure white coffin before me. Suddenly, I felt someone tap my shoulder and spoke in a familiar voice, "....(Name), sweetie..."



I closed my eyes and turned around, not wanting to confirm my theory. When I opened my eyes and met that person's gaze, I shivered.


"...You're..."

A few moments later, I woke up, sweat trickling on my forehead. I realised I was already inside the saferoom, lying on one of the comfy beds. After stretching a little, I sat up on the edge of the bed and looked around.
"Oh, (Name)...you're finally awake, that's a relief." a soft voice said. I turned my head to see Canada, handing me a small towel. "Thanks..." I said, using the towel to wipe my face.
The blonde haired Canadian gently placed a hand on my shoulder. "Have you rested well? Is there anything you need?" he asked.
"Yeah, I've gotten the sleep I need, thanks. I'm alright, I don't need anything right now." I told him.
He then pointed over at the tables across the room. The rest of the countries were sitting over there, looking like they were having a discussion of some sort. "Then let's head over there, eh? You're an important part of our meeting." Canada told me. I shifted nervously from my seat.
They were going to ask about so many things, and I'll have to explain mountains of my experiences, encounters, and information....most particularly about the Second Players. Though...there's nothing to be afraid of now. Yeah..... that's right. ....I don't need to hold anything back about the 2Ps anymore...
I clenched my fists and nodded in determination. "Yeah...let's go."
As Canada and I walked towards the others, I started to hear their conversations.
"I'm sorry. I guess I lost more memories than I thought." Italy said, looking down.
Japan shook his head, "No, that was good enough.The rest is our job."
"Still... don't you feel kind of weird to think that you could die?" England asked, creasing his forehead.
France raised an eyebrow. "As if we were the same as humans, you mean? Maybe we exist as humans in this place..."
"You're right. My body doesn't carry the weight of my nation...Even though I don't look any different..." China agreed, scanning his own features.
Their heads suddenly turned to me as they noticed me approach them. There a was a small silence that filled the room, I didn't like it, so I tried to start, "....I uhm....so...how should I start this?...What to say...?"
