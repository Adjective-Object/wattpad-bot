"Uh sure, thanks," I said and handed my clothes to him. We walked downstairs, I went to the kitchen and Matt went to his washing room. All the guys were cleaning the kitchen.
For the rest of the day, we hung out, messed around an did the stupidest stuff, and Nash, Hayes and I left at about 10. (if any of you were wondering where Hayes was, he was hanging out with the rest of the guys before we left for the photo shoot.) When we got home, I went straight to my room, I took a shower, got changed into random pj's, brushed my teeth, went downstairs, said goodnight to everyone before going back to my bedroom. I laid in my bed, and before I fell asleep, my phone buzzed. I checked my phone, and it was a message from Matt.
