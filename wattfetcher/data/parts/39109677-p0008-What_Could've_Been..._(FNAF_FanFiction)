I sat down in second period, slightly pleased with how the day was turning out. I had made friends. FRIENDS. ME.
I mulled over the words in my mind. It makes no sense...I shook myself out of my thoughts as the late bell rung.
History. It was the one class that I went to twice in a day, it was also homeroom. Almost all of my homeroom students went to this period for history, save for about 5.
I wonder if Foxy's going to this period... I doubted it, Mrs. Herna had said that the new students had pretty diverse schedules.
Mrs. Herna walked to the front of the class and announced our assignment. TO go over our notes. AGAIN. We'd been doing that all week...it was getting old.

✨Ten Minute Time Skip Brought to you by Golden Freddy!✨

I sighed and put down my notebook, this. Is. Sucky. I thought, letting sarcasm weave into my mind's voice. It was the only one I used now, and I couldn't even remember what my real voice had sounded like.
I looked up from my desk, She isn't watching... I pulled out my sketchbook and began to sketch a bunny.
Yes, its childish, but they'd always been my favorite animal. They were perfect, fat, fluffy, they got along well regardless of what they looked like. Humans could stand to be more like bunnies...
I looked up as I heard the door squeak, there must be another new student.
Yup, I thought as a guy walked into the classroom. Bingo. Like the others I had seen so far, he was gorgeous. Are all of them from models-vill, USA or something? He had purple hair and red eyes, odd.... but still hot. He was lithe and muscular, and seemed to be trying to show it off. He wore dark denim jeans, a tight-fitting purple shirt, and had purple bunny ears sticking out of his ruffled hair.
"Class," Mrs. Herna announced, "This is Brady Bonright. He'll be joining our class for the remainder of year."
Brady waved, "Yello!" he greeted us, "I'm, as you know now, Brady, but I'm better known as Bonnie."
Some of the guys in our class snickered, Bonnie was a girl name around here.
"You can pick where you want to sit, Mister Bonright, we have a few empty seats in here."
I slunk down in my chair at this comment, please don't sit by me... I tried to make myself as unnoticeable as possible by stuffing my face in my notebook, leaving my sketch facedown on the desk.
Bonnie seemed to notice me, however, and came over to the desk beside mine.
"Hello," he said kindly as he sat down, "You should take your face out of the book, you're really pretty."
I lifted my face up a little bit to look at him, to see if he was joking. He didn't seem like it... his face remained serious.
I flipped to a clean page in my notebook, again.

I don't talk, by choice. EVER. And before you ask why, it's because the people here shun me because I look like a freak and I'm completely ignored. My name is Proxis and, NO, I'm NOT pretty.

Bonnie looked at me with the same look that Freddy and Goldie had given me before they hugged me. Anticipating what was to come, I flinched away, but it was too late.
