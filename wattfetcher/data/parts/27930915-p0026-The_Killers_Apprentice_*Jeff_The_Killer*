"Should I be worried? Should I call the cops?" I pace around the living room as Wyatt watches me.
"No. Why would you call the cops? Isn't he a bad guy?" Wyatt asks me.
"Yes but I-" He's right, what am I thinking? What would I say to the cops? 'Help, my murderer friend is missing'? "You're right, Wyatt. Maybe he has a cell phone? Or like some type of pager? No, that's stupid, people don't use pagers. Maybe if we tie a letter to a pigeon and train it to find-"
"Stop panicking! It makes me very nervous!" Wyatt yells at me. Jeff has been gone for three days now and I don't know how to get him home. I don't know if he's hurt, or even alive.
"Wyatt he said he would be back in a couple of hours and it's Friday!" I shout back.
The second my sentence ends we both hear a crash at the front entrance causing us to jump. We turn to see Jeff, bloodied and limping. I immediately run to him to help him down the stairs. "What happened? Are you okay?" I ask, holding his arm.
"Clockwork.." He groans as I escort him down the hallway and into his room.
"Clockwork? Toby's girlfriend?" I ask him, sitting him down on his bed.
He looks up at my, wiping the blood from his lip. "Yes, Toby's girlfriend. She beat the shit out of me." He tells me.
"Why?" I ask, getting out the first aid kit.
"Because I beat the shit out of Toby and his girlfriend does all his fucking dirty work for him." He explains, wincing as I clean his wounds.
"What a coward.." I remark.
"No shit." He says.
"So she just came at you?" I ask him as I wrap his wrist.
"I was walking out of a bar and she cornered me in the alley. I'll admit she can fight. I barely got a scratch on her." He says.
"You couldn't have stabbed her?" I ask. Anger boils inside me, hearing of someone hurting Jeff makes me more than upset.
"We have this.. rule." He tells me. I finish his bandages and sit beside him on the bed.
"Oh, sorry, I forgot. No one on the bed." I stand back up. "What rule?"
"Killers can't kill each other. It's like a moral code." He explains.
I laugh. "Murderers have a moral code?" I ask. "What happens if you break this code?"
"He comes." Jeff says very seriously.
After a moment I ask; "Who comes?"
"Someone you don't want to meet."
"But you.." I begin. "You were about to kill Toby when he attacked me."
"Yeah, I know." He tells me.
I give him a small smile. "Why were you gone for so long?" I ask him.
"I wanted to make sure I didn't leave a trail for the cops." He tells me.
I nod and touch around his bruised eye.
"That hurts!" He deep voice booms as he slaps my hand away.
"I was checking to see how swollen it was, drama queen." I tell him. "I'm going to go get some ice."
"I can get it." He says harshly then stands up.
"Hey, hey.." I gently push him back down onto his bed. "Let me take care of you, Jeff. It's okay to depend on someone every once and a while. You're not alone anymore, you have me."
