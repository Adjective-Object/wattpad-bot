3 years earlierFagEmo WorthlessWere all the words that went through my head. Me at the age of 15 didn't know what to do. So to help myself cope I cut ,scars all over my thighs pathetic right. For a long time i believed what everyone said about me. I felt worthless, I am emo,and my parents thought i was some satan worshipper.I spent my child hood hiding my face in a book, crying my self to sleep. I did not know what the future held for me. What would my mate think of me? Would I be good enough or another failure for another?
