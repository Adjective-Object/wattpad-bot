I sighed as the class chatted and conversed. Why can't I be like that again? Just for one day.
I heard the whole class draw in their breath, but with my wall, I had no idea why. Must be the new kid. I reluctantly pulled down my wall, I should at least look at him before he started hating me like the rest.
I almost drooled in my seat after looking at him. He was tall, maybe six five, with shaggy red hair that went a couple inches down his back. He had luminescent yellow eyes, and a mischievous look on his face. He wore a deep red boatneck t-shirt and dark denim jeans with holes in the knees. Not to mention how hot he was.
The trademark bad-boy character. I thought as I looked at him. He looked around, met my eyes and I instantly looked down at my desk. But from my peripheral vision I could see him grin.
"Alright..." Mrs. Herna mumbled as she surveyed the class, most likely looking for a place for the new kid to sit. Oh shit... I thought as she glanced at the empty desk next to mine. She wouldn't... Mrs. Herna mumbled to the new kid and he started towards the back of the room.
Please stop there, Please stop there... I prayed as he reached the last empty desk before mine, which was the one closest to the back. Fuck...
The boy didn't stop. He continued. And sat. Right. Next. To. Me.
