I suddenly scratched the back of my head nervously. "...Well, you see...back when you guys plotted against the Second Players, I was really against it...so I thought that I should at least warn (Name) about it and see if she could help me out in talking some sense into you guys. So, when I saw that she left her phone on the bed while she was in the bathroom, I secretly opened the phone case and looked for her sim. It conveniently displayed the phone number there, so I saved it. I was able to text her about your plans earlier because of it."


"...Wow, Canada...that was pretty sly and actually scary if you listen to it...but since it actually came in handy, I'm glad you did it." England said with mixed feelings.


I laughed awkwardly. "Ahaha..yeah. Anyway, I'll try calling her now. It seems like the signal has gotten better all of a sudden, so I think now's a good time."


"Well, I hope for the best." England smiled. He then turned back to the kitchen counter and began...cooking. My stomach felt like it turned a few knots, but I waved it off.


Right now, I need to try calling (Name). I hope she has her phone with her. Pulling out my phone and going through the contacts, I pressed on a certain number. (Name)'s.



"Please, answer. I need to know if you're okay, too." I thought to myself as I heard the line ring.


And ring.



And ring.




....Until eventually, someone picked up.



"Hello?" a familiar voice asked.
