Black spots blur my vision.....

I feel wobbly, and confused. I look at my surrounding.

Creatures come toward me while I'm on the ground. I scream but my mouth is tied.

They come closer and I squirm on the ground.....

"This is all Drake's fault, it started with him..." I thought to myself. Something tightened the binds around my body.

My body started to become cold, something warm flowed out of my head as I laid.

Circulation slowed down and my body became numb....

I laid there not knowing what is going to happen.....
