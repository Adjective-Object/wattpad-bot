"Sounds like a plan," I look at Kelley "ready?"
She nods her head "ready."
About 3 hours later we gathered 98 people exactly. Each with their own unique abilities and names. We gathered them in the mess hall. I stand on a metal table and yell over the chatter of the crowd "HEY!" This shut them up right quick "every single one of us has a unique ability and no memories before this. So I highly doubt that we all are here by mere coincidence. Now this facility had us contained for some reason. If we are going to do anything besides be guinea pigs for some experiment we first need to figure out why we are here."
A face appeared on the opposite side of the room on a screen running the width and half the height "why don't you ask me?"
"Probably because we are just now aware of your existence."
"Ah, I see you are still the smart side of the ass. Now you all are here because you harmed the world and her people. From burglary to genocide because of this we have rid you of your human rights and we have modified your DNA to give you power beyond imagination; however you are criminals so we needed a way to change your ways. Amnesia! Yes, and to make sure you behave we have killed every member of your immediate family and put you in a hibernation like state." This let out a huge gasp by the crowd "you, the people of this facility need to escape it when you do you will be admitted to the military. This is your only option if you try to run you will die tired. So I encourage you to escape and become one of us."
