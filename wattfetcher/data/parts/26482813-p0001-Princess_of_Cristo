I run thoughts the forest. My soft cold feet hitting the rough hard ground. I am surrounded by so many questions. Why? Who? How?....
I looked down at my dress. The white silk fabric stained with blood. Not mine. My brothers. I pushed the thought out of my head. Now was not the time to think of him.
I kept seeing flashes of what happened. My father falling. Blood flowering from his shirt as he told me to run. My mother trying to rush to his side as they pulled her away screaming. My brother..... my brother trying to rush me along the halls.
Trying to get me out of the castle. Trying to keep me safe. Just when i thought we could leave, escape. He was shot.
"Run Anni!" He called "Run!"
"I can't leave you" I had said
"You must" he had replied
The blood poured out of him just like it had my father. Spilling all over my dress. What had we done to deserve this.
I kept running. Just as I had been told. Kept pushing the horrible thoughts out of my mind.
For now I had to keep strong. For I was Annistasia Marie van Brooke.....Princess of Cristo.
