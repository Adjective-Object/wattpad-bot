I put my laptop on my desk and got back in my spot, "I might sleep like this." I said putting the blanket over us, "I have no comment." Hayes said chuckling, I laughed. I leaned up and kissed him, "Good night babe." I said pulling away, "Good night babes love you." he said, "I love you." I said.
"Good night Jake." I said he barked and fell asleep, I cut off my lamp and cuddled towards Hayes.
We soon fell asleep.
