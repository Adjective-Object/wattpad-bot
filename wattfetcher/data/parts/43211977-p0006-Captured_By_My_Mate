I wake up to broken glass I run down stairs to see Ethan kissing some other blonde chick so sexually I am in awe I run upstairs grab my iPhone that was charging on his dock and I grabbed my headphones my house keys and my clothes and my Pradablack handbag
Running down the stairs once more I open the French doors and slam them shut I walk home to find him walking behind me saying "stop! I sorry babe!" I turn around and shout at him "don't call me that!you want to be fucking someone else when I have fucking feelings for you?your just a hoe! I say as I put on my phone and do something I didn't do in a long time
I talked to my brother.
"Mhm yes #1 cherynobyl drive.yep see ya." He now is staring at me with black eyes as I wait for my brother. My brother pulls up with his red Ferrari says "jump in" I do that then I hug and kiss my brother. Ethan then snaps his neck and I see my bleeding brother on the floor I scream as kneel to his bleeding body I sob.
He tries to comfort me by saying "I'm sorry I really didn't mean to he says as he started hugging me" with my strength I harshly push him away and I say "don't fuck me you slut I don't want to talk I say while angrily stamped inside I see her and she pisses me off more then I slam the French doors this time shattering the glass and I stomp upstairs and slam the door again this time cracking it I sob in the bed feeling lonely but this time I feel stronger as I did this.
Time passes by as I lie in my bed not coming out for like 2 days
He enters and jump in bed and grabs me "what the fuck I told you about touching me?"
He frowns as I get out of bed he asks "where the fuck you goin?"I don't reply and I exit the room running into the forest
