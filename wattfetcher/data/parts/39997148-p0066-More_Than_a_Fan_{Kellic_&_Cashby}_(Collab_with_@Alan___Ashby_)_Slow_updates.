"Fine." I grumbled as he started handing me his camera supplies.
"Thank ya baby."
"No problem." I mumbled following him around with all of his equipment as he walked around taking pictures of practically everything. "Why do you take so many?"
"Because I either delete them, keep to edit, give them to you guys, sell them or use them for class assignments." He said looking back at me, "Sorry if I'm boring you."
I shrugged, "It's fine. You're cute when you take pictures, well you're cute all the time but you look so concentrated when you take them and your nose scrunches up a little and it's adorable."
He blushed, "Aw thanks." He said, "I'm all done."
"Awesome!" I said, "Ready to go back to the bus?"
"Yeah."
"Alright let's go." I said taking his hand, "I need a shower and I'm so tired."
"I know you do need a shower."
"Are you telling me I stink?" I asked glaring at him playfully.
"Yes I am. You stink and it's gross."
"Just for that when we get back to the bus I'm gonna give you a big hug and get all of my sweat all over you."
"If you do that I'm never letting you in my bunk ever again."
"Yes you will or else you won't get to cuddle with me."
"I think I'll live."
"No you won't."
"Yeah I will. You're not allowed in my bunk."
"Then I'm  going to get my nasty, stinky sweat all over you."
"No you're not." He said walking on the bus with me. "Now bring my stuff back here."
"Yes I am." I said following him to the bunks.  He took everything from me and put it away carefully before turning back to me.
"Go shower."
"Nope." I said and pulled him into a tight bone crushing bear hug.
"Austin!" He shouted, "This is gross! Let me go!"
"What's wrong babe? I thought you liked hugging me."
"No, this is gross." He whined, "Baby let me go."
"Only if you promise that I'm allowed in your bunk."
"You need to shower before you get in my bunk and now I need a shower."
"If I take a shower will you let me?"
"Yes I'll let you into my bunk."
"Okay then," I said and let go of him.
He looked at me pouting, "Now I'm all gross."
"Oh you'll be fine just take a shower." I told him smiling.
"I didn't need to till you got up in my business and made me all gross with your sweat."
I fake pouted, "Aw poor you."
"Yeah poor me. I'm going to shower now."
"I need a shower much more than you do."
"No you don't." He said glaring, "You are in even more trouble than before."
"No, I'm not. I'll go shower now"
"No you're not going to." He said and pushed me out of the way as he headed to the shower.
