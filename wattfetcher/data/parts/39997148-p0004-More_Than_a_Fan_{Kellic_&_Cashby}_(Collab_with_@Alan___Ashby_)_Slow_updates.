"No, I know you Austin. You think a guy is cute then you hit on him and things go south. Just leave him be." He said, "And good you can help him get settled in."
"You say you don't want me to flirt with him but if you leave me alone with the kid that's exactly what is going to happen."
"Don't. If you do I'm gonna do something or whatever. Just be friendly, not flirty."
I shrugged, "Well we'll just see what happens."
He rolled his eyes and walked off soon be replaced by Alan, "They said you'd help me I guess."
I gave him a flirty smile, "Yeah I can help you."
"Oh well, thanks." Â He said quietly.
"So how old are you?" I asked trying to make conversation.
"I'm nineteen. What about you?"
"I'm twenty two." I told him, "So what got you into photography?"
"I've always liked it. It was kind of my go to thing in high school."
"Oh that's cool."
"Yeah. What got you into music and well this band?"
"I've always had a passion for music." I told him smiling a little.
"That's cool."
"Yeah, so are you excited to do the photography for this?" I asked as we finished everything up.
"Mhm, it's going to be an experience." He said smiling at me, "So you scream? I've only heard a few songs by you guys."
"Yeah I'm the screamer, and you're about to hear a lot of it and probably get tired of hearing me." I told him laughing a little.
He shrugged giggling, "Well it'll be fun doing business with you guys."
"Yes it will be."
"Well thanks for helping me get settled in." He said just as his phone started ringing. He took it out and started smiling, "I have to take this, but thank you again."
I nodded and left him alone to his answer his call.
"You didn't do something did you?" Tino asked when I walked out to them.
"No I didn't do anything. I was being nice and friendly."
"Well your nice and friendly is more flirty"
"I wasn't flirting with him. I don't even know if he's gay but I bet he is."
Everyone groaned and rolled their eyes at me.
"What?"
"He's dating someone. I'm pretty sure he mentioned a boyfriend when I was talking to him in the park." Phil said.
"So I have a chance?"
"No, he's taken."
"I still have a chance, he's too cute to not at least try."
"You're not trying anything Aust."
I smirked at my band mate, "Whatever you say."
"No don't, don't do that. You're not going to fuck this up and try to get into this kids pants or whatever you want to do. You can't and you won't." Aaron said sternly.
"And why not?"
"Because he's our photographer and if something goes down between you two and he gets screwed over then we might not have him anymore. So no and that's final."
