I finally got Â the picture of frunas!!! I got this pic off of google. Look up frunas on google and you cand see more pictures. If there is a latin food market near you, go there and see if they have some. One bite and you'll be addicted (or not. depends on your tastebuds). Anyways thanks for reading and sorry for the suckish update. I just really wanted you guys to see what they looked like. Thanks for reading. BAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!! ( Don't you dare put in the comments that I don't know to spell "bye" correctly because I just spell "bye" ccorrectly) Also, I as I was publishing this I tried to add the photo but when I hit the save and publishe button it said I had problems( as in, with the URL)and I found so frustrating that I decided to not add the picture. Sorry.
