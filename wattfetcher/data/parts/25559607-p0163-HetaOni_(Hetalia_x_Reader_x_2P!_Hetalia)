At the end of the stairs, there was a door. The girl reached up for the knob and opened it.


"You found me!" the person inside the room exclaimed, their back was turned away from the girl.


The girl went inside the room and I followed after her. The room was quite small, I noticed. "Well, this *is* your favourite room!" the little girl said as a matter-of-factly. "You got me there~" the person replied.


"Oh! That big clock is really pretty!" the little girl pointed to the grandfather clock inside the room.



Wait.



What's......that big clock doing there....?



I stepped closer to the little girl and to the person she spoke to. I began becoming curious. What's this? What kind of dream is this?



"Yes. Very. It's very important, too." the person told the little girl, turning around.


When that person turned around....it all slowly started to hit me.




I know that person.



And that girl?




....I know her, too.




Because that little girl...



....that was me.
