Stampy's pov:Recording with Sqaishey is gonna be great! I'm pretty sure that she had never played Minecraft on the xbox before, so she will walk into things alot. It will be really funny! I hope that she does not catch on very quickly, so she will ask for tons of help. Maybe I can even go to her house and teach her there!
I got a text from Sqaishey saying that she is ready to record when I am, so I skyped her after i got all of my equipment together. She is going to post the video on her channel too.
Right when she answered, I hit record.
Sqaishey's pov:
"Hello this is Stampy!" He said right as the call connected. "And I am going to be joined by Â Sqaishey!" "HELLO!" I practically screamed into my microphone. "And today we're going to be playing SKYDEN!" He shouted back. "YAY!" I screamed at him again! "YAY!" He yelled at me. I guess that we are yelling at each other now "I HAVE AN IDEA!" He yelled. "WHAT!?" "HOW ABOUT WE YELL FOR THE WHOLE VIDEO!?" "OK!" "R.I.P. headphone users.
Stampy's pov:
She was so cute when she yelled. Her voice got all high and squeaky. It kept cracking every once in a while. I am so love struck.
After the video, Squid skyped me. "You like her, mate. Admit it." He said. "I do not!" I said, sounding like a six year old. "If you don't like her, then you must love her." I tried to lie again, but I just couldn't keep it up. I stuttered. "No I-I-I..." "You what?" "Fine you got me." "Yes! I knew it!" I didn't say anything back. "Don't be ashamed buddy! I have a girlfriend, and I love her to death!" "Yeah, I know, but I don't want the internet to find out because..." "What?" "I just don't." "I respect that." "Thank you." "Why don't you ask her out?" "I really want to. She is so pretty. And cute. And nice. And funn..." "I get it. Well think about it. I'll call you tomorrow, and we can talk about it." "Sounds good." "Night mate." "Night."
Author's note:

I'm sorry that I haven't written in a while. I was busy with school, I got really sick, I had a dance performance, and my brother had a soccer tournament. I will be updating as much as I can. I am also going on vacation next monday and tuesday, and there is no wi-fi there, so I will be writing, but not updating. I will update as soon as I can. (maybe tomorrow?)
Also, THANK YOU FOR 100 VEIWS!!! I am starting out slow, but I will get better. I promise.

Thanks for reading!
