I run and run, never running out of breath. Never getting tired. Something is driving me, the adrenaline is constant, it seems like a have an infinite amount of stamina. I wasn't even paying attention where I was going by now, I just needed to leave. To get out. Then suddenly, I fall. I realize that I have just bumped into someone.
My bloody knife and clothes fall out of the bag onto the pavement behind me. I shake as I realize that I've been caught red handed. Unless.. I could kill the person?
I scramble for my knife and stand up, ready to attack,but the person grabs my wrist and holds it.
The skin that holds my wrist is pure white and leathery. The figure is holding its head to its feet. It wears a white hoodie and black dress pants.
It slowly picks its head up to reveal a completely white face, and giant round eyes surrounded by rings of black, and I horrifying smile that was clearly carved in. It goes ear to ear.
I tremble as it comes closer to my face. I drop the knife, my mouth open in shock as the creature opens its mouths to say.
"Never fear my friend, for I am just like you."
