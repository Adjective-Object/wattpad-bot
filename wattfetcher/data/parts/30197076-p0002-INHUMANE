3rd Person Point Of View...~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~
Lightning Struck Through The Sky, Followed By Thunder Roaring Loudly As Brianna Struggled To Drive Her Black BMW Through The Muddy Streets Of The Blue Moon Pack Territory.
To Say She Was Furious, Would Be An Understatement.After all, Coming Home Late, nearly Midnight, On Your Sixteenth Birthday With Barely Enough Energy to Party Or React Is Bad Enough.
Thanks To Her Stupid Work At The Pack's Main Hospital And Her Highschool Life Wasnt Making It Much Better.
Yes, She Works At Such Young Age As She Would Be Graduating A Year From Now Anyway.. She Was a Healer..Meaning She Was Created By The Purest Power Of The Moon Goddess..We Wouldnt Say "Born" As Her Demon/Witch Powers Were Instantly Swooped Away The Minuite She Was Out To This Cruel World Right At The Begining Of a New Century..
That's How a Healer Is 'Born'.
At First, She Thought She Was Cursed To Have Her Powers Locked away.. To Be..Different From Her Siblings But Later on, She Learned To Live With it..
She Learned That Power Is Not Everything..Just Like Love..Everyone Is Different But It's How You Decide to Live your Life That Will Make You reach What You Desire To Have and Be.
She Might be Different ..Yes. But At Least Her Family Is Living Fine And Well..Her Pack Is Not Some Corrupted, Ruthless Bastards And Lastly, Her Siblings Arent Disgraceful or Judgemental. They helped her through the Way And Still Do.
Little did She Know..That One Mistake..One Accident Would Change Everything..
After all, Life Isnt All Unicorns And Butterflies, Is It ?.
.

Finally, She Slammed Her Foot On The Car's Brake Stopping It Abruptly Before Placing Her Head On The Steering Wheel Tiredly..
She Was Still Finding It Difficult To Drive A Car at Such Young Age But Hey.. She's Sixteen now Right ? She Can Handle Herself...
She Let Out a Huff Of Annoyance as She Thought Of How Her Daily Routine Would Commence Everyday.
Shrugging The Matter Off For Now, She Pulled Her Head Up Staring At The Darkness Which Surrounded Her As She Thought Quitely, 'Where Is Everyone?'
Clearly Perplexed For Why The Whole Packhouse Lights Would Be Out That Time Made Her Seem..Nervous As She Didnt Think She Was That Late.
Snatching The Keys Out From The Ignition, She Hopped Out Of Her Car, Slamming The Door Loudly Behind Her Before She Flinched Visibly As The Sound Seemed To Slice Through The Howling Wind.
The Sound of Leaves Crunching Beneath her Feet Stood Out The Most Along With The Howls Of The Wind Every Now And Then As She Walked Down The Road Aiming For Her Family Mansion. She wouldnt Call It Quite a House as it Was Expertly Furnished And Decorated luxouriously.
