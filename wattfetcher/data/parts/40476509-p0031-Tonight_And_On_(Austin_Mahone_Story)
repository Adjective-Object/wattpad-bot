Amanda's P.O.V.
*A month later*
Today I decided that I was gonna Skype my family since I haven't seen them in so long. So, I grabbed my phone to call my mom to see if she was able to Skype me. My phone rang three times and then she finally answered.
*Phone call conversation*
Me: Hey mom
Mom: Hey Mamas, how are you doing?
Me: I'm doing good, how are you?
Mom: I'm great. I'm glad that you called me, I miss you so much.
Me: I miss you too, are you busy cause I want to Skype with you.
Mom: No I'm not busy, I'll get on Skype now. I can't wait to see you.
Me: I can't wait to see you too. I'm gonna get my laptop and get on Skype, I'll see you then.
Mom: Ok I'll see you soon bye
*End of phone call*
As I got up to get my laptop I thought about how I didn't tell her about the accident and that I was in a coma. I started to get worried that Austin would tell her when he meets her over Skype today. He had went to the store to buy some food for us and then he would be coming back.
