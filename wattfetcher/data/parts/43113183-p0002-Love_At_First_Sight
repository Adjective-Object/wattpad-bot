Cameron's POV  Ugh school. I am a popular boy but a jock. I hate it. I want to be liked for me not for my looks. Now I am get ready I put on my leather jacket and get my bag. Then went downstairs to eat and get my lunch ready. "Bye mom gonna go to school," I say. I ride my bike to Nash's house then I hang with him for a bit. I knock on his door. Hayes opens. "Sup," I say as He lets me in. "Nash is taking a quick shower," Hayes says. "Cameron," Skylynn comes and jumps up on me. "Woah hello. Ready for school," I ask her. "I don't wanna go," she says I laugh. "Cameron you hungry or thirsty," I hear Nash say. "Maybe a little thirsty," I say. "Okay. You heard that Autumn's step sis is gonna be new at school," Nash said getting me lemonade. "Didn't know and don't care. I hate Autumn she hates me thats life," I said. Nash shrugged. "You all ready to go," Nash asked. He takes Skylynn to elementary. So now Nash takes Hayes to middle school. Now it is me and him going to school. Now we are here at Hismeric High. I see Autumn's neon pink car. I look straight and see a girl right by Autumn. "I think that's her," Nash said patting my back.
