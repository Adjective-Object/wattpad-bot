Mark's POVI see y/n is still sleeping so I get up ever so slowly, and decide to see if tom is up. I walk towards the guest room, and.... tom is asleep. I decide to get ready for my day instead. After an hour of showering and bathroom duties I get a skype call, it was Sean or jack. "Hey what's up buddy" I say still trying to whisper "Hey mark buddy!" Him being his usual self luckily I had headphones on... "what did you need jack?" I ask "ohh! Im moving to L.A. isnt that exciting!" He said literally yelling "oh your neighbors must adore you right now!" We both laugh "but yah thats awesome, where would you be moving?" I ask "well thats the thing... I was hoping I could stay with you until I get a place!" He said putting his finger on his lip and biting his nail as if he were afraid I'd say no... " well, when will you be coming?" I ask him "tomorrow..." well Thomas is leaving tomorrow morning im sure we can plan this... ____After schedule for tomorrow___Y/n's POVI wake up to mark talking on the phone guessing since I'm now living here I will be able to take a shower I did (oh yah... thats the thing you moved out here didnt add that part in when taking to your adoptive parents...) I walk out when both the guys are on the couch talking about food and how I took long showers knowing they were being dramatic... "Fine! where's a place to eat?" Mark was thinking "theres a diner up the street... lets go there!" Me and Thomas just said okay and we left.___another skip and a hop___We all got to know each other more while at the diner and mark told me one of his friends were moving out here to L.A. and he would be staying with us exciting news for mark. We got back home and mark got a phone call I could hear 2 male voices, couldn't make up what was said but knew there was 2 different guys on the line thats when I heard my name... and then mark shout for me, I walk to his office "yes mark..." I say "Wanna play some drunk minecraft?" He asks " I mean you are of age! But that only if you wanna!" He said lifting his arms up spinning his chair around "well hell yah I wanna play some drunk minecraft!" I say "thats the spirit! Wait is that a good thing to say to your.younger sister..." we laugh he points to the screen showing two guys "Thats bob! And thats Wade!" He says pointing to a guy with a purple polo first and another guy with a black shirt. I wave towards the camera he is skyping from "and who is this mark?" Wade says "as I said dumb dumb my sister Y/n!" Mark reply's I laugh "I didnt know you had a sister mark..."the guy im guessing is bob, says "neither did I bob, neither did I..." we played and got totally waisted... well atleast mark did, thinking I was new to this game! We played all night and finally it was time to knock the fuck out...___Next morning___I had awoken and of course started my day by watching tv, I rarely got hangovers which I thought was weird... Mark had awoken half an hour later "is you ready?" He asked me thinking he was still drunk "for what?" I ask confused "to drop off thomas and pick up my friend!" He shouts being dramatic "oh yah sorry forgot" I laugh so does he.____Another frickin time skip cuz how lazy I is___We drove to the airport and walked thomas to his gate "Bye y/n, it was great to finally meet you!" He said, we all said our goodbyes and headed towards marks friends gate... he still never told me his name...  I see a guy about 5 10 approach looking around his 20's. He bro-hugs mark and turns to me his bright blue eyes glistening like wow is he hot "well hello there miss!" He says "Is that the american way?" He turns to mark, I laugh. You can tell he is foreign, his accent was pretty strong... All I knew was he was pretty handsome "My names Sean, but you can also call me jack!" He sounded childish but pretty mature in a way...____A/n____There we are... a part yay, wellp im tired I wrote this at 1:20 am for you people your welcome!!
