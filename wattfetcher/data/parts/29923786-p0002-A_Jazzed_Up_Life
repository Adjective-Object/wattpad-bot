The girls walked out if the Locker room and into the hallway. Cindy saw a friend and left to talk to her. Jazmine went to catch up to Huey. She spotted him at his locker and walked over to him. "Hey Huey." She said walking up to him. He looked at her and nodded. He closed his locker and began to walk outside. They have lunch this period. The food that they feed them 'was exactly what they feed pigs', in the words of Huey Freeman.
They reached the parking lot and stared each other down. "Rock, Paper Scissors?" Jazmine asked. He once again nodded. They quickly began their game, and Jazmine won. Huey scowled. They did this every day to decide whos car to take out to lunch. Jazmine's car is a hot pink Lexus that she got for her 16th birthday. Huey's car is a plain black Lexus.
The two teens hopped into the car and went to the usual place for lunch. There is a place by the highschool called Karen's. The place was both a healthy and fast food restaurant in one. Jazmine placed a pair of stylish sunglasses on. 'It makes her look hot' that's what Cindy said. She drove her way to the place and got out the car in a so called 'sexy' manner. They entered, ate, payed, and left.
They arrived back at the school 10 minutes before the next period. It wouldn't matter anyway because they had a free period after lunch. The two sat in Jazmine's car, the radio was on and the voice of The Weekend singing Wicked Games was coming out of the speakers. Jazmine sang along in a medium voice. She changed the words up so that the lyrics could match her gender.(A/N the bold= lyric change
"I left my boy back home. I don't love him no more, and he will never fucking know that, these fucking eyes that I'm staring at. Let me see your face. Look at all this cash. And I emptied out my cards too."
Her melodious voice rang around the car. Huey sat back in his chair and listened. She new this song by heart, every sing word and every single ooh yeah. As did Huey, he always listens to her beautiful singing. He loves it, he won't admit it unless she asks.
These two are opposite. He is a quiet, easily annoyed, strong, always scowling, revolutionary man, He wont admit things so easy. She is a giddy, smily, caring women. These two fit together like two pieces of a puzzle.
Huey sang along in his head. Listening to an internal duet that only he himself could hear. He watched her beautiful, orange, curly hair bounce as she sang. This was one of the many things Huey Freeman liked about Jazmine. Her beautiful voice.
