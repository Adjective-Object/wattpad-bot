I spun around "Will you quit it!" I whisper yelled she just laughed and flipped me off. Andy and his other friend I think its Ashley were looking at us I just flipped her off and turned around.
"Will you two emo freaks cut it out!" Bitch one whisper yelled at us.
I looked at her and my eyes flashed for a sec before I kicked the shit out of her chair which sent her pretty little ass to the floor.
Me and Bella were trying not to laugh but we ended up laughing our asses off. I could tell that Andy and his friends were to I looked at bitch one and her face was as red as a tomato.
"Mr. Lundy the new girl kicked me out of my chair." she whined.
"Snitch." I grumbled. Bella laughed again.
"Miss Williams!" He yelled.
"My foot slipped." I said and shrugged.
He just sighed and went back to whatever the hell he was doing before.
Finally the bell rung and the two barbie dolls were the first to leave. Now we have a whole period to do whatever.
Bella came running over as I was sitting and about to grab my bag. "You my friend are a goddess!" She dramatically said.
I laughed and just shook my head. "I already know not to mess with you considering you threw a damn brush at me for a wake up call." she said rubbing her head.
"You did it first." "Yea yea, whatever lets go." she said as she dragged me out I just chuckled when I remembered I left my phone on my desk.
"Hey, I'll be back I left my phone in the class." "Okay."
I walked back into the class to see the 5 boys walking to me Andy held his hand out.
"I was going to bring this to you." he said I took it from him and thanked him flashed him a smile and he did the same while I walked back to find Bella.
This is going to be a long day.....
