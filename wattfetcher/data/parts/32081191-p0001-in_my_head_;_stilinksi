So, i gave into writing a teen wolf fanfiction. im deeply sorry for yall who read my coming soon books and then i took them down. honestly i dont know why i did that but i did ao no take backs.... so yeah now that that is out of the way, welcome to in my head
idk when the book will come out, my goal is to have ten chapters before i post the prologue but idk if i will be able to wait that long
if yall couldnt tell by the deadpool above, this fanfiction will take place in season 4 and i must warn you, the chapters probs wont match up to the episodes because i am doing this mostly on memory so yeah
i am probably boring you by now so
kisses, l.
(ps my spelling, grammar and capitalization is not this bad I just type most of my author's notes on my phone)
