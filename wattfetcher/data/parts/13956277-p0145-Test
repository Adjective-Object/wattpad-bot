"It looks good" I smiled, "Told you are an artist" Tom giggled as we were staring at the huge sign he made.
"ASK US ABOUT ISLAM, KNOW THE TRUTH OF ISLAM" The sign said.
"What is that ?" The English teacher asked, "Well, since it's the International day and every student introduces his country, religion and traditions in a corner, we decided to introduce Islam" Molly said.
The teacher checked the table and saw the papers we had printed the day before, the books we brought and the cards, "Whose idea is this?" He smiled, "It's mine" I smiled, "Glad you got back to the old you. Can I have one of these papers?" He smiled at me, "Yeah sure of course, what do you want to know? About our religion generally, about our prophet or about the rules and what to do and what not to do ?" I was excited, my Christian English teacher looking for informations about my religion without hate in his eyes or disgust like others, encouraged me to continue fighting. "I want all of these" He said, "It would be better if you go step by step, here are some informations about the prophet and how Islam started" I gave him a book.
All the students reached the school, there were 7 groups, each of them had a table and a sign. Students gave me, Tom and Molly some glares, then Robin and his friends came. "How are you Robin ? What's going on with the pranks ?" I giggled and he did too, "Everything is fine, I was just telling my friends how fun you are and how awesome and that what they say about you Muslims is wrong, so we came to ask you some questions to figure out what Islam truly is" Robin smiled widely, I felt happiness run through my veins. "Yeah sure ! Come here" Molly took the kids and opened a conversation with them and gave them some papers to read, "Thank you Robin" I gave him one of the chocolate bars I had in my purse, "What are all these for? You feeding the whole school?" Robin chuckled, only if he knew that I was feeding the baby inside me too, I faked a laugh and slapped his arm playfully.
"Hey ! Look what's going on? One day you are wild and free, and the other day you look like a ninja and try to make us convert" Jake mocked, "What's that?" Miley flipped the papers. I saw Simon, he was standing beside Peter, both of them were watching, "Leave her alone, if you are bothered just walk away" Peter said, Simon's eyes were sparkling when he looked at me, when our eyes met, he pulled his phone and pretended to be typing, but I knew he was just acting because the screen of his phone was locked.
"Come here" I heard Simon, I thought he was talking to me, I thought he was going to apologizeÂ  for everything he had done, I thought he was going to tell me that he's ready to handle the consequences with me and become a father. Too bad, when I looked at him, he was pulling Molly, he didn't want her to stand with me and Tom and defend Islam. "I'm not going with you, this is my life, these are my choices and this is my religion. You got nothing to do with it" Molly said, Simon raised his hand in the air, Tom ran to him and caught his hand from slapping Molly, "Leave her. You didn't mind when she was going out half naked, now you mind because she's covering herself ? Read these" Tom put a card and some papers in Simon's pocket, Simon glared at me then started walking towards me, "Stop this, I want my sister back, or else ..." Simon put his hand over my tummy, "Go away" I slapped his hand and went back to the students I was talking to, "Anger isn't good for the baby" Simon whispered in my ear then walked away, I felt pain in my stomach, I ran to the bathroom and vomited. "Is everything Okay ?" I turned my head and saw Simon standing and looking at me with concern in his eyes. "What do you want ?" I dried my hands, "Looks like my son isn't very quiet " He smirked, "What if it tuns out that it's a daughter" I chuckled, for a second, I thought that he came back to the old person he was, I daydreamed about a house with the three of us in. The smile faded from his face and he put the frown back on then left. Why is he doing this ? Why isn't he clear ? Does he want me ? Does he still care about me ? Or what?!
