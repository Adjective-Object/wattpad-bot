I have a plan. It's actually a plan for living believe it or not. If it's up to me it won't work. But it's well structured.
I have my warmup, stretches, and workout. I have a diet.A pill box. Basically everything required for my survival.
I have a schedule and yes, it will work.
My death will happen at any point in this plan.
At least I'll look nice when I go.
