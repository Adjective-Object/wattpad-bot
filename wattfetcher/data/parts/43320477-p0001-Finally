Lela's p.o.v I'm so exited for today I just hope I don't mess up I mean worlds is the biggest day for a cheerleader and if you mess up at worlds it's over for you. Anyways right now I just finished getting ready and let me just say I'm looking on fleek. as I was leaving my hotel room I grabbed everything i needed and out I go. I walked out and headed towards my teams bus when this girl walked past me she looked very familiar , but I couldn't grasp where I saw her , but I had to push that aside as it was time to get on the bus and go to worlds 🌍.
