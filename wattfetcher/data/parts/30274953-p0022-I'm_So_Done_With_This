Okay still ranting about Disney. So everyone knows how Elsa had the gloves on through the first part of the movie. But, I bet you didn't know that gloves usually symbolize that someone is hiding something. So when Elsa removes her gloves her secret is reviled so no more need of da gloves. Moving on.
Now I will shock you all. If you didn't notice Hans wears gloves through almost all of the movie. But when he tells Anna his secret plan he removes his glove. BAM! Just shocked all of y'all. But when he goes to talk to all those kings telling them that Anna had "died" his gloves had mysteriously sneaked back on. Let's just dwell on how sneaky Disney is.
So, what's Mickey Mouse hiding?
