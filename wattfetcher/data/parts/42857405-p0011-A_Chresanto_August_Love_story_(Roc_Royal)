Roc- you having my baby ?
Me- Oh now you care didn't seem to notice me when you was having the time of your life with a thot
Roc- Aye look I'm sorry for that okay baby
Me- you think sorry cuts it! You lucky I'm talking to your dumb ass! I loved you and you  come back and hurt me! What type of ish is that? I was angry and didn't want to speak to him
Roc- Baby please forgive me it won't happen as gain
Me- Roc get out my house
Roc- what?
Me- GET OUT MY HOUSE!
Roc just looked at me with sorryness in his eyes. A tear dropped from his eye and quickly left. I kinda felt sorry for doing that but his presence was annoying me. Prince and Jenna came back in.
Prince- Aye where's roc?
Me- Not here that's for sure, I need space for now
Prince - aiight,  Jenna I'll see later babe
Prince kissed Jenna good nite then left. I explained everything that happened to jenna and she comfort me. We finally not ready for bed and told eachother goodnite. I slide underneath my cover thinking about what happen today. The last thing I need is stress for me and the baby. I fell asleep.
Okay well I will update tomorrow so be here to read and like I said if you want to be in my story message me (only picking two people)Give me feedbacks and leave comments. THANKS❤
