Mikey's POV:
Beautiful. That was one word to describe, I thought to myself. I looked through my telescope to see when Lana and Mouth were coming, mostly Lana. I know I sound like a stalker but, I like her so much. It was our last weekend together and if I didn't tell her how I felt I wouldn't know if she likes me back or not. I smile, seeing Lana walk down the road joking around with Mouth.
"Lana's here isn't she?" Brand asked teasing me, I blush and nod. Then we here the door and me and Brand look at each other he gets up and pushes me which makes me stumble back. He is already half way down the stairs and I begin down the stairs but he already answered the door.
"Hey Lana! Mouth!" Brand said
"Hi?" Lana said
"Did you happen to look up while you were walking? Or any time your walking?" He asked sweetly, oh no. I can not let her find out that I basically stalk her.
"No" she says, Mouth looks impatient
"Well, I would love to tell you that-" but Brand was cut off by me pushing him out of the way.
"Hey guys! Come in!" I say getting out of the way for them
"Hey thanks Mike!" Mouth says walking to the kitchen.
"Thanks Brand was being weird." She says hugging me and sitting on the couch. I followed and sit down, and I rubbed the back of my head
"Hey I heard that!" Brand yelled
"Sorry Brand!" She yelled back laughing
"Yeah. Anyways, how's your day been?" I asked trying to change the subject
"It's been great." She says "better now that I'm with you" I heard her mumble. And that one sentence gave me the power to feel like I could freaking conquer the world.
