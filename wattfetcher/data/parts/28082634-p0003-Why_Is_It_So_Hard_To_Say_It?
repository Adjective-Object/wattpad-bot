He looked that boy straight in the eyes, something i could never do.
"Oh c'mon! This is not of your business!" the boy shouted.
"No, its not, but since i heard it, it is now" said the curly-haired boy.
"Whatever... But ill talk to you later Harry, we will see it soon." the other boy said, turned around and walked away.
Harry looked at me.
"Thank you..." i said.
"Its nothing, dont worry, are you okay?
"Yeah... Thank you, not everyone dares to talk to him like you did" i said as i payed my dad's beer.
"He's an idiot..." a short silence "Oh, by the way, im Harry, Harry Styles" he said as we shook hands
"Oh hi, Im Louis Tomlinson" i said the most normally i could.
There was something in his eyes that made me feel that life was worth living if he was by my side.
We started walking.
"Are you new here?" i asked to make conversation.
"Is that so obvious?" he said giggling.
"Yeah, hahaha you arent scared yet" i said.
"Well, maybe you can teach me to be scared" he said sarcastically.
"Oh i would love to" i said while i blushed but i continued laughing.
"Youre funny Louis... Why do you let people treat you like shit?" he asked.
"Well... I just... I just think i deserve it..." i whispered.
"Well, you dont, you are a good person and you dont deserve being treated like that..."
"You dont understand" i said.
"What? That you are a nice guy who deserves better? Well, yes, i do understand" he said.
I was getting unconfortable with that conversation so i tried to change it so i said "as its obvious that you dont know the city... Would you like me to give you a tour?" .
"Really? Thank you! I really need it" he said.
