So my friends are kind of dramatic. ALL THE TIME. I don't want to use their names so they shall be called Betty, Cat and A.(no I don't watch pretty little liars) NOT THEIR REAL NAMES.
Cat: I'm dying *dramaticly flops on desk*Betty:that's niceCat: THATS NICEA: I will always miss youCat: I won't miss you Me: I'll haunt your dreamsCat: *looks at me strangely*Me: ...Me: I think I need to be in a mental hospital...Wow........ that's all I have to say
