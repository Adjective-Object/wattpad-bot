Hey guys.
Laptop broke down and I had my story there and it was on point.
Sigh.  Should've put it on Wattpad when I had the chance.
Luffy:  Saki -chan,  you're stupid. Me: Look who's talking.
Aya:  So what's gonna happen to the book. Me:  The main story will be on temporary hold and I'll do some fillers instead.
Haruka:  So what's the story so far?Me:  Um, not much really.
All you need yo know that Aya is a Nurse working with Chopper,  Bepo and Law.
Sakura somehow avoided a fight with Kid and that really pissed him off.
That's basically it. I'll post that chapter when the laptop is fixed. Hopefully.
See ya!!!
