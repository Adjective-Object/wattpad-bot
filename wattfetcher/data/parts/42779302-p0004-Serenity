I could tell she was joking but I needed to be stern with her, just so the attitude could stop.
"Fine." She growled.
She got up off the bed, slowly stomping towards me. Now that was my attitude. The stubborn Chris.
"Daddy! The phone." She shouted , cutting me from my thoughts.
"Oh sorry." I apologised handing her the phone.
" Hello, Hi mom." Madison sighed.
Well, While they talk let me make myself comfortable. I ran and jumped on madison's soft bed. Causing her teddy's to fly up.
"YOU SEE MAMA! HE MESSED MY BED!"Madison grabbed her hair like a mad women.
"You need to get back here , and get your husband." Madison acted like my mom.
I couldn't help but laugh, Madison was a comedian without even trying. Although, what made her think we were married? I wasn't ready for all'at. That word in it's self scares me.
"Okay , mama. I love you too." Madison cut the phone.
She ran too the bed and jumped on it landing next to me.
"Mommy said, we both gotta be nice to each other." She smiled kissing my cheek.
"See, Im sorry baby. For not making enough time for you. I promise on the weekend I will make all the time in the world." I played with her curls.
"Okay daddy." Madison smiled.
"Gimme kiss." I puckered my lips.
"eww you look like a fish daddy." Madison gave me a stank face.
"Shut yo breath and give me a kiss or Im gone find another daughter." I rolled my eyes.
"No,No,No I was joking." She quickly kissed me.
"Thats what i thought." I got off her bed. " Now let's go get you bathed."
"Okay daddy." She lifted her arms up for me to carry her.
"You too old for all'at." I eyed her up and down playfully.
"Pleaseeeee." She did her puppy face.
Aww shit , here go the puppyface.
"Ughh, Fine you big ass baby." I carried her.
"Yay! Now to the bathroom butler." Madison tried to do a British accent.
"Now you doing too much." I sucked my teeth.

"Im In Target Tyrell!" I shouted quietly into the phone.
"Then why cant you send me a picture huh? He Protested.
"Because I'm pushing the cart! Gosh, Cant you give me a break." I sighed heavily.
"You know what I'll deal with your stupid ass at home!" Tyrell cut the phone.
Great, when I get home there will be a surprise beating waiting for me at the door.
"You okay mama?" I looked down at Chiara sitting in the cart.
She nodded her head rapidly snickering. She was just a happy baby in General.
