"I'll Fight For You" is part one in a series I have in my head.Somewhere in my head...The first half is about a boy and his girlfriend in a community plagued with indiscipline and gang violence. The boy, Uriel, had anger management issues and could not cope well with it. The Story uses dialectal variation to capture a wider target audience. The target audience is mostly young adults, teens who are just beginning their high school life and college students. This age group can be one of the most violent.		The writers main purposes are to show the trails faced by everyday unsuspecting teenagers, the second purpose is to show how comfortably you can use your Tae kwon-Do skills to your advantage. Lastly it can also be a motivation to anybody who wants to learn how to protect themselves using martial arts.Part two is still jumbled in my head...
