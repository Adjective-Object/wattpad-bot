"Indeed. If all goes well, Germany and Italy should also be able to join us there. Let's put everything in order here and hurry." Japan said.

"Say, ______? Are you okay over there?" England asked.
I waved my hand again and the menu disappeared.
"O-Oh. I'm fine.." I told him nervously.
England looked like he was about to ask something else, but waved it off. "Okay.. By the way, thanks for the biscuits.. Uhm, I think we've had enough rest. Let's go check out the rooms." He then stood up and held his hand out to me. I reached for it and thanked him. Canada stood up as well and brushed off the crumbs on his clothes. After that, we entered the piano room.
=================
In the Piano room...
>England & Canada & _____<
"Okay, we'll examine this room before the others get here." England told us.
Canada nodded. "All right. Um, first, this piano...
It has these numbers, you see."
"I'm not sure what they're supposed to mean.Was there something we needed numbers for?" England asked.
"No." Canada replied.
England then walked over to the shelves and skimmed through the books. "Hmm...."
Canada, on the other hand, began pacing around the room to think. "Numbers... they must be a code for something. Something that uses numbers...
Numbers... puzzles... Security, too.So, security breach... but this house isn't that high-tech, so... a safe, or something..."
"Hey! The books in this room are nothing special, so wait here while I go to the room next door.
There were a lot of books there, so I'll leaf through them." England called out.
Canada turned to him and nodded. "Oh, okay. Just be careful."
England then leaves the room and heads for the other one across the hall. I wanted to check on the the other's progress, and I knew what was going to happen in this room next..so I needed to leave asap. I walked over to the deep-thinking Canadian.
"Uhm, Canada?"
Canada turned to face me. "Yes, ____?"
"I, uh, think I left something outside while I was fixing my bag. I'll just go check if it's still there." I told him, pointing at the door.
"Oh. That's alright. Be careful and return as soon as you can, okay?" He said.
I smiled. "I will. Thanks."
As I turned the knob, I remembered something. I turned to Canada and spoke, "Oh, and...Canada?"
Canada heard me and answered. "Yes?"
"You are the piano." I said, giggling a little.
"What..?" Canada was about to turn to face me, but I quickly dashed through the hall to avoid further questions.
--------------------
While I was out in the hallway, I peeked in the other room to check on England. He was reading some books and leaning on a shelf. I closed the door, unnoticed.
I decided to go up the stairs a little and sat on the steps.
