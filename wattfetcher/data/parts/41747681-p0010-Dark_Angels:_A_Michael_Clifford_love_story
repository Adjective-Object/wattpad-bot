"You said it yourself the first day Jessie enrolled us in this hellhole," Lacey buts in, her voice shaking the slightest bit. She takes a deep breath to calm herself down before continuing on. "You said Griffith University is where all the rejected teenagers go for a college education. If we're such a hassle for you, then why don't you just expel us?"
"Because I know what you've gone through," says Matthers calmly. "And you too, Avery. I know what Jessie's gone through, Gem, Julie, and Jane as well. I know all of your stories. And you know what I have to say about it? It's a damn shame unfortunate things have happened because you really are a great bunch of girls. Troubled kids no doubt, but underneath all that anger and hatred, there's still some good in you all. I'm keeping you enrolled because I want you girls to succeed. The real world sucks, and you need to be prepared for it."
"Believe me," Avery grumbles. "We know."
