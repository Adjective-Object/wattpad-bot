I wrapped my arms around his neck and deepened the kiss then he pulled away and my eyes were widened so were his
" I'm so sorry " he said backing away from me
" same " I said touching my lips
" let's not tell anyone including Justin he would kill me " he said
" agreed " I said staring at him then I kissed him again and he deepened the kiss and I wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck then he sat me down and I pulled away
" I thought" he started to say but I cut him off
" I didn't say I wasn't OK with it but your Justin's bestfriend I dont want to ruin that" I said pecking him on the lips
" let's head back " he smirked and I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his car he opened the door and stopped me from getting in with a kiss which I allowed and replayed the previous events then climbed in the car . He walked around the car and climbed in the driver's seat then grabbed my hand and started driving .
........................................
" babe can you pass me a bra " I asked Justin   facing him he dug through my drawer and threw my black lace bra in my direction I caught it with one hand and smirked  at my amazing catch and threw it in my suitcase then walked over to my closet and grabbed my cr√®me heels and  my black skinny jeans and a  a few singlets along with my most casual clothing . I set everything in my suitcase and shut it  then grabbed Justin's suit case and pulled out  a jumper then pulled my shirt over my head and slid it on then threw my shirt in the laundry  and turned around to see a wide eyed Justin
"Get over it " I smirked  pushing my way past him
" let's go some where  our plane doesn't leave till tomorrow"  I whined  wrapping my arms around my boyfriend you read it right boyfriend we made up and  no I didnt tell him about christian I don't plan on doing it  that's his best friend   I thought touching my lips at the thought of his lips on mine   he was a good kisser wait what
" are you talking about me babe "  Justin said kiissing my cheek I mentally face palmed myself  if I say that out loud what stops me from saying I kissed christian not once but three times. Omg I'm a mess maybe this vacation  will help straighten my head out  . I sighed and nodded to Justin and pecked him on the lips  maybe  the whole christian thing will make it easier for me to leave Justin he will hate  me  and he will move on but until then he's mine .
"I love you" Justin whispered  which made my breath hitch
" your making this hard"  I  sighed letting go of the air I didn't even know I was holding in.
" thats the point "  he smirked grabbing my suitcase and his and walking it out to the car.I dragged my self out the door and sat in the passenger seat and groaned as Justin sat behind the driver seat   and looked over at me with a smirk
" babe I'm gonna win you over " he Smiled wide
"Justin  we have to go " I whined  putting my seat belt  on
He put his on and started the car ........................................@ the airport
