Their jaws dropped, "You-You're beautiful" Diana said
"Thank you, you are way more beautiful than me" I smiled
"No, Really like really beautiful, you're hot, and I'm a girl and shouldn't say that, what would the boys say" Diana said and we All burstedÂ out laughing.
"Hey" another girl walked in
"What are you doing with that B****" She said
"Excuse me" I pulled the door
"Where the heck do you think you're going ? you stole my boyfriend" She pushed me
"WHAT???" I shouted
"Stay away from Jake" She warned me
"Astaghferollaah, Well, tell HIM to stay away from me because I didn't give him any attention, And I already DON'T date or care about any of these stupid childish boys here" I said then walked out like a boss after I left her speechless.
some boys were standing and speaking , two lovers stood behind them, And there were a group of girls glaring at me.
me: It's not my problem that Im hot
mind: shut up you are ugly
me: Not you too mindy eyyhh
I felt a pair of hands on my waist, my eyes got widened, then I was spun around to face who held me.
It was Jake, I pushed him forcefully and took some steps back
"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, THAT'S HARAAM, I SWEAR IF YOU TOUCH ME ONE MORE TIME YOU'LL NEED TO SEE THE DOCTOR"I shouted as loud as I could, people started to gather around us.
"Sorry" He smiled
"Astaghferollah Astaghferollaah Astaghferollah I should've lowered my voice"
I headed to my class .. chemistry.
"Now, In this experiment you should be couples ... Miley with Ashley .... Sara with Ian.... Leena with Jake ..........."
My mouth hung open.
"Come on partner, we need to get started" Jake teased.
"I hate you"
"I can deal with that" he said, we did the experiment, I was amazed, He really knew what to do.
"woah" my eyes got widened
"what" he giggled quietly
"I thought you were one of these stupid popular boys I see on TV. But you're still stupid and I still hate you anyway" I said, He bursted out laughing, the teacher glared at us, so did his girlfriend.
He put his hand over mine and leaned closer to me "You look hot when you're angry, Oh these beautiful eyes" He smirked,
I pulled my hand and slapped his face in a force I didn't think I had, The sound was loud enough for the whole class to hear, Jake gave me an evil smirk after he rubbed his cheek, My eyes started to get teary, I left my seat and walked out.
"LEENA, DETENTION FOR A WEEK" The teacher shouted but I was too angry to care.
"Astaghferok ya rabb" I whispered while I was running and wiping my tears.
I went to the Art room which was empty and pulled my small praying carpet to pray on , It was time for Duhr prayer.
"Allahu Akbar" I said, Then someone opened the door, Thank god the person didn't cut my prayer
