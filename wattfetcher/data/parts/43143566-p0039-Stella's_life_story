As it got darker i took my shower-which was always interupted irritatingly by mother- i hopped out-not literally, i would slip and brake something knowing my luck..-but noticed All my cloths were gone aside from a freaking towel and bra...oh how lovely..
my eye twitched recalling the conversation i had with my mother-when she interupted me showering-
,"do you want me to keep your cloths here?" i clenched my fist trying to controll my anger ,"yes ma..."
1 hour later
there gone...I WONDER WHERE THEY WENT. *F.U.C.K.I.N.G. E.Y.E. T.W.I.T.C.H.*
,"kris?" mother calls out making me silently growl. ,"what." i spat out as i cover myself with a towel and put on my bra-thank god bryan wasn't in his room...-
,"did you brush?" my mouth dropped in disbelief. ,"no,id like to get dressed." there was silence. ,"did you deodorize?" i had to control myself from punching the wall...
,"no." she let out a simple 'oh.' silence.,"love you~" she said with a laugh to me. i gladly would have wanted to say
,"flip off ma~ :)"
