I check the time. 1:50. A couple of more hours? Yeah. I will be fine. *Click click*. Almost finished.  I am creating a song called 'Time lost. Me too'. It's about a man lost in time but when he comes back to face reality. He loses his mind. You know? It's a work in progress. I take a sip of Monster. I take a break from my song and get on Facebook. I have been waiting to see al the useless shiz people put on their page . I call my friend on Skype. *1 hour later* "And  I was all like you can't talk to me like that. You may have the butt  of Nicki Minaj. But girl you got the attitude of Amanda Bynes.".
"Hi to you too." I say
"Oh sorry gurl."
"Mhm."
We both end up laughing. I look at the clock 4:13. I exit out of the Facebook. "Ugh" I say
"Anything interesting?"
"Peter is getting married."
"Again? Aww gurl must be mentally ill."
"It's a boy he's getting married to actually."
"OH. Ewww."
I feel a tear come down my face without realizing my face cam was on. "Wait did you like peter?!"
No "Yes"
"Wow girl."
I am bisexual. "No it's ok."
"Gay... so sad... Poor boy. He will change soon."
"Yeah.... I gotta go."
"Umm ok bye."
I check the time 4:15. The time was going by so slow now. "I'm gay." I repeat over and over again to myself. I started to cry some more. One last time "I'm gay.". My mom walks in.
"You're what sweetie?"
"Hungry I'm hungry." I say in a panic.
"Ok honey." She walks out the room and doesn't close the door. "Ugh" I think as I get up and close it. I sit down at my computer again. I start watching Markiplier. I stop crying. If anyone knows the feeling of sadness and then the stupidest thing makes you feel better. That's how I feel about Markiplier. I couldn't be crying my eyes out literally and he could make it all better. Anyway, I just watch. For hours probably. Then I looked at the time. 7:30. Wow. You can really get stuck in your own mind when it feels like someone else is there. Right?
