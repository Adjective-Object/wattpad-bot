Ella's POV
"Hermione, come here! There's a compartment... that's kinda empty?" I said, pointing at a compartment with a boy and a girl.
Hermione and I slid the door open.
"Hello? Can we sit here?" I asked the girl.
"Sure!" The girl replied.
We sat down across the boy and the girl.
"Hello, I'm Ella Valencia and this is, my dear friend, Hermione Granger" I said. "And you two are?"
"I'm Neville Longbottom" the boy said.
"And I'm Jassmine" the girl said.
"Okay, pleasure to meet you" I said. Why didn't Jassmine say her last name? Oh well, some things are meant to remain secrets.
