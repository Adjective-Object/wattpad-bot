He still sleeps on this side? "Sorry," I turned around the door was closing "Mark wait," the door opened and it reviled him in just boxers, every time he walks through that door he has less clothing on,
"Yeah," he whispered, "you sleep on the same side of the bed?" I smiled at my question, he looked down at his hands, and looked back up our eyes met, "do y, can yo, I," i stuttered, he walked over almost like he read my mind I moved over and he got into the bed, "thanks," he just smiled.
I fell asleep soon after it was different having someone in the bed, it was nice, comforting.

I woke up to an alarm, ALARM, wait what is this, an arm oh god what happened last night, I turned my head to see the face, the light of a new sun rising shone on his face, Mark, why am I here?
What time is it 6 am, what the, I got whacked in the face with marks hand "agh," I screamed which made him jump "what," he shouted and stood up, "are you screaming for?" I laughed I don't know why but I laughed, I was lying on my old bedroom floor laughing with my ex over something that I don't know.
The room got darker and I felt a breeze on my face, I slowly opened my eyes, they met with his and we started to inch closer "I need to get home I have to be some where," I butted in, I grabbed my clothes and tripped over some of his clothes, "shit so do I," he got dressed and I waited in the car, he brought out a suit case and shoved it in the boot, he locked the door and drove me to my house.
"Thanks," I smiled at him and ran up the drive way opening the door to the sound of my aunties 2 month old baby crying, is she even awake, I went upstairs and Xander was in his pram, my auntie was sleeping, I sighed and went to lift Xander out and I nursed him. I made him a bottle and he fell back to sleep,
I woke my auntie up and she started to get dressed for going on our weekend trip, "where's Harley?" I asked the 3 year old devil himself arose from the bed and giggled, "emi!" He screamed and jumped into my arms.
"Harley! How's my boy?" He hugged me and gave me a kiss and pit his thumb up, I sat him on the bed, "I'm away to pack and get dressed," I waved at Harley and walked out to my bedroom.

We were driving to the church where we where getting picked up by the bus, "so there is this boy I want you to meet," oh no, "yeah?" "Yeah, he's so sweet, he will be staying with us, he was dealing with a break up last year so hang low on the girlfriend talk," I looked at her like she was growing a moustache,
"He is still broken, anyway, he's been coming sever since a couple years after you stopped, you'd like him, he was a bit of a bad boy though," she said parking the car.
We got out and I grabbed Xander, "hello baby," he smiled at me with and started laughing, i gave him over to my auntie and grabbed Harley's hand, "Emily?" I looked up, "agh," I screamed "brad I haven't seen you in donkeys," I hugged my old best friend, "how have you been?" I had a massive smile on my face, "Auntie Jen, you didn't tell me brad was coming," she rolled her eyes, "im great what about you? I heard all about the break up last year,"
She told him, well she would tell everyone that's her specialty but brad? Why? "Yeah I'm great, it's hard seeing him in school, last night was crazy aswel-" I cut myself off, fuck.
"Last night?" He said confused, "yeah last night he helped me I was on a date with a rapist and he-" "wait a second you were in a date with a rapist?" "It's a long story," "well we have the time, come on," with that he grabbed my hand and pulled me to the back of the bus where we always used to sit.
