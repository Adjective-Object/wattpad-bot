Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the boy swimming away towards the alcove. No, She would not allow him to steal the treasure of the river. She was the guardian of this river, and he would know it.
She slashed at the boy, which left a giant wound on his left arm, and he grabbed onto his arm in pain. He glared at the girl, with a look of hatred in his eyes then hit her scimitar with the knife, sending it away to fall on the floor. Lethe tried to go grab her scimitar, but she couldn't- pain, pain, pain, more pain, and even more pain, just pain everywhere, and she couldn't think right now. She felt herself floating now.
She looked at the boy , who was trying his best to ply the rock from its entryway. Lethe thought to herself, Yeah, man, it's impossible to pull on that. My magic couldn't just simply let an outsider pull it out.
But then he lifted his arm, the one with the bracelet, and she an explosive flash of dazzling white. A couple of tiny roc debris flew out, some of them scratching Lethe. Last thing Lethe saw, was the Talisman of Dreams in the boy's hands.
No, she thought in vain. And then she blacked out.
