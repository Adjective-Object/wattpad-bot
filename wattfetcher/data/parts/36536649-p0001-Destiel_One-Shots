Mary Ellen Winchester, Dean Winchester's daughter, dragged him along by the hand to the Barnes & Noble nearby.
"Dad, come ON!" Mary screeched.
"He's not gonna be there if we go at your pace, Mr. Molasses!"
"Calm down, he'll be the--"
"DAD. J. Novak, my favorite author in the history of EVER, mind you, is at the local Barnes & Noble. HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS AND WE'RE GONNA MISS HIM!" She cried out.
"Mary," Dean said, reassuringly. "He said he'd be there from 9:00AM to 6:00PM. It's EIGHT. It'll be okay."
"But Dad," she began, but Dean cut her off.
"C'mon, maybe he'll be there early."
At the very thought of this, Mary's eyes lightened up. "Okay!"
And as sure as the TARDIS is blue, J. Novak was there early. And, strange as it was, no word had gotten out that he was there this early, therefore the was no herd of pre-adolescent girls.
"Oh my GOD, Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Look. DON'T LOOK. What are you doing, why aren't you LOOKING?!"
"Mary," Dean said sternly. "Deep breaths. In, out. In, out. Like we rehearsed."
Mary did as she was told. "Thanks Dad."
"Well, he doesn't look too busy. And... he looks familiar..."
"Wow, Dad. I wonder if all those pictures of him I showed you had ANYTHING to do with it. Probably not, right?"
"Yeah, yeah." Dean replied. "It's probably the pictures..." But Dean couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than some pictures his daughter had showed him...
"I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna walk over, and then we can get Heaven And Hell signed, and then we stalk him from afar."
"And then we what now?"
"And then we go home."
Dean and Mary walked over to the table Mr. Novak was at. He noticed them approaching and smiled at them.
"I guess you want your book signed?"
"Um... Uh... Y-yes."
"Oh, which one? No, no, lemme guess. Hmm... It's either King Of The Damned or Heaven And Hell..."
"You're right!" Mary said with enthusiasm. A little too much enthusiasm. She cleared her throat and said, "I mean, um, yeah, Heaven And Hell is my favorite book."
Dean couldn't help but giggle, and Mary kicked him, and thankfully, Novak didn't notice.
"So, what's your name?"
"Mary Ellen Winchester. Oh crap, you didn't need to know all that."
Dean was definitely laughing now.
"Winchester, huh? I used to know a Winchester..."
And finally, it clicked.
"Cas?"
Castiel's head snapped up from the autograph he was writing.
"Dean?"
Mary Ellen was astonished, but didn't say anything.
"Cas, it's been so long. I can't believe it."
"Dean, you have no idea how many letters I wrote."
Now Dean was surprised.
"Cas. I wrote exactly 377 letters and never sent one. I should apologize."
