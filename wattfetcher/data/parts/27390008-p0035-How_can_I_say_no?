"These are amazing! I love them!" I said. Johnny smiled.

"I'm glad. Believe me when I say it took me weeks to figure out which shirts to get you." Johnny said. I ran my fingers over the picture of Peter pan. "So what do you want to do all day?" Johnny asked. I shrugged.

"I was thinking maybe just lounging around the house today and going out for dinner." I said. Johnny nodded.

"Or I can cook, we get dressed up and I give you a good reason tonight." Johnny suggested. I smiled and nodded.

"Sounds good. But you will need to be very creative. I'm not just gonna do that with you for the sake of doing it." I said as I stood. I trailed my finger over Johnny's shoulders as I walked past him.

"Where you going?" He asked.

"Taking a shower." I said and walked into the bathroom. Johnny looked at me with longing. I was tempted to as if he wanted to join me but if I did that, I wouldn't be able to stand my ground about waiting. "I'll be out soon." I promised and, true to my word, was out ten minutes later. I walked out and saw Johnny on the phone.

"Yeah yeah yeah. But it's gonna be done right? It better be. Whatever. Yeah I'll see you later. Bye." Johnny hung up and turned around. He saw me in the doorway. I wouldn't have said anything if Johnny hadn't looked guilty.

"Who was that?" I asked. Johnny turned around and busier himself with cleaning off the bed. "Johnny, answer me. Who was that and why are you gonna  see them later?" Johnny sighed and stood with his back to me.

"A friend. That's all you need to know for now. I'll explain later." Johnny said. Confusion and betrayal rose in me.

"Johnny....." I started. He cut me off.

"I said later!" He yelled. I was taken back. A thought passed through my head. I didn't want to ask. But I did anyway.

"Are you cheating on me?" I whispered. Johnny turned to me.

"What?" He asked. His tone was one of shock and disbelief. Like he couldn't believe I was asking him that.

"Are you cheating on me?" I asked again, louder than before. Johnny started toward me but I stepped away from him. Johnny stopped and stood where he was. I watched what he did. And I hated every second of it. I was watching the man I loved break and fall apart. It tore me apart inside but he still hadn't answered me. Tears started to appear in my eyes. I fought the instinct to run to him and have him comfort me. He was the reason for my tears. "I guess that's my answer." I said, taking his silence as a yes. I turned and walked out of the room. I didn't know where to go, but I knew I'd find somewhere. Johnny hadn't taken me to the Hollywood sign but I'd found a way there. I'd go there. I went right through the house and opened the front door. Johnny appeared at the stairs.

"Samantha!" Johnny yelled. "Samantha! Please don't go! Don't leave me!" His voice cracked and I knew. I just knew he'd been crying. I forced myself to go out the door. I headed toward my sanctuary without looking back. "Samantha! Please! I love you! Don't go! Please! I need you!" I started to run. Tears blurred my vision and I wanted to turn back so bad. But I never did. I ran until I reacted the sign and I found the little park empty. I sat down under a tree and wept freely.
