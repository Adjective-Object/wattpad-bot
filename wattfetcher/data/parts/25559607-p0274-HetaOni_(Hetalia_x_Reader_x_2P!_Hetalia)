///Third Person PoV///




"Italy! Hey! Italy!! Wake up!"




The brown haired, Northern Italian began to stir and awaken. Once he opened his amber eyes, he saw his muscular German friend.
Germany breathed a sigh of relief. "Oh, you're awake. Are you all right?"



"Ve?! wh-what happened to me?" Italy sat up, looking around the room to figure out where he was.


Germany placed a hand on Italy's shoulder. "Are you hurt?"


"I'm not...Um, my journal went awry all of a sudden, and then, um...?" he paused, trying to recollect the past event.


Germany shook his head. "Sorry, I don't get it, either. I remember being surrounded by a lot of enemies, but not...the journal going awry?"


"What?! You don't remember, Germany? After I shouted, 'Make me disappear somewhere!' you ran to me with all your might." Italy told him, hoping he'd remember.


Germany creased his forehead. "What? Wait a minute. Did you say...'Make me disappear somewhere?'..."


"Oh, don't get me wrong! I didn't mean I wanted to die. Besides, you see, the fact that we're here means that we did disappear from there, right?" Italy smiled.


Humming a little, Germany spoke, "Mm. Well...you do have a point, but...my memories of being surrounded by the enemies are very hazy...Where are the others?"



"Oh, th-that's right! what are we going to do?! The others must still be fighting!" Italy exclaimed frantically.


Germany straightened his uniform and turned to the door. "All right, let's go back. If we make sure they have a way out, they should be able to retreat. The enemies were in their way before."


The two walked down the hall cautiously, but then stopped when they saw a shocking sight. There was another set of countries that were there by the front door. They froze as they witnessed the happening at a distance. What they do not know that time, was that it was their past selves that they were seeing.
