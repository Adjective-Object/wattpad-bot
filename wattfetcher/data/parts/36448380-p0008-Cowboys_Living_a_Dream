Ben's P.O.V.
I can't believe that today I am graduating. I am going to miss high school so much though. Football is a big part of me. I don't know how I am going to let that go. But I have more important things to look forward to this summer. I am going to be working on the Schurr's farm. I know it is going to be hard work because Abby's brothers keep reminding me. I love how they are always teasing me. I love the fact that they really care about their sister.
"Ben, are you ready?" My mother says walking into my room.
"Yeah mom. I will be down in one second," I reply.
"Ok."
Before I go downstairs, I grab my robe then walk to my dresser. I open the top drawer is a promise ring for Abby. I wanted to get he something special for a graduation present. I hope she likes it. It is just a simple white gold band with small diamonds around it and a bigger diamond in the middle
When we get to the school, the first thing I do is go to the class room where all of the seniors are meeting before we graduate. I am so excited to see everybody. We all look so grown up. I have been with these guys since day one of Kindergarden. Most of us have been together since Kindergarden, but some came in middle school.
I find my ears are fixed on Abby. She doesn't usually wear a whole lot of makeup or do her hair other than a pony tail, but today she has her hair curled and down. She just look beautiful. But she looks beautiful every day.
"You look amazing," I say when I walk up to her.
"You don't look to bad yourself," she replies laughing. We just smile at each other because I don't want to mess up her makeup. We then go find her group of friends and talk to then until we have to go into the auditorium.

"Benjamin Tyler Borden." My principal calls my name. Now it is my turn to get my diploma.
A few names later and now it is Abby's turn.
"Abigail Leigh Schurr." At the sound of her name her whole family starts shouting. I think it is awesome. I start laughing a little bit because they are so enthusiastic. A little while later all of the names have been called and everyone has their diploma in hand. Then the Valedictorian gave a speech.
"That's it guys. We did it!" Are the last words that the Valedictorian, Jennifer one of Abby and I's very close friends, says. Then we all go crazy and throw our hats in the air. We all start running out of the building. Me at the front with the rest of the football team. All of us were shouting, "2015!!!!" in our football team voices. After we are out of the high school, I find Abby. She runs up to me.
"I have been waiting to do this all night," She says and I didn't know what that meant until she kissed me. I feel like sparks flew.
"I love you," I say.
"I love you too."
