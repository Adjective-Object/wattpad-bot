I'm not a professional on this topic I really suck! But I always wanted to try making these points. Be aware these points may suck terribly and might not totally be true and that's because there coming from out of my head which is um pretty shitty so anyways... point 1: when you look at the person or think of em you have to smile Point 2: Just seeing that person with another girl/ boy can make you super jealousPoint 3: Whenever he/she talks to you get butterflies!!!Point 4: Your too shy to keep eye contactPoint 5: The first person you think of when your awake is him/herPoint 6: You always try to sneak a glance at themPoint 7: if that person text you first it literally makes your whole day!!Point 8: That person can make you wanna change everything about you just for him/herPoint 9: You try to look your best just to impress him/herPoint 10: You would do any and every thing for that person you'd give up your whole life for em!!!!!
So those were 10 points that prove your inlove I know they sucked haha what can I say I'm just a 13 yr old with no experience *shrugs and walk away*~Jeneilia X
