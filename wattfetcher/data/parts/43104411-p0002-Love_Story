I walk in the door and my dad was home early and I knew I was in trouble he told me to unpack yesterday and I forgot and I was going to unpack today after school. I was so lucky he hadn't seen my room yet and I went straight up to my room and turned on some music texted dillion and got to unpacking and I got it all through before dinner and I had a little time before dinner so I texted dillion I said "hey" he said "wassup" I said "want to hang at the park tomorrow" he said "yeah sure that sounds fun." When we was eating dinner I was silent and mom said "did u meet any new friends" I said "Yea and I was wondering if I could go to the park with this friend tomorrow" dad said "sure but be home by six in time for dinner" I said "ok."*next day*I was walking and here comes dillion running up to me he said "hey wassup" I said "hey"*after school*We was walking to his house to get his car and then we headed to the park he had a picnic set up.
