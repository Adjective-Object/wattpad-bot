Prologue
"Maureen!" my step-dad yells from downstairs. I pause my music, what now! He can't ever leave me alone, he's always yelling at me for something. Ever since my father died, my life's been a living hell. My mom said he died of a freak wolf attack while hunting, I never got any other details. My mom and me were distant for years, he was her everything, with him gone she was always depressed and snappy, working 24/7. Then my mom met Mitchel. He was rich and quickly swept her off her feet, she was happier than ever. Making me even more miserable. "Maureen! I said get down here now!"He yells once more. "Ugh! Fine! I'm coming!" I yell. I get downstairs to see an irate looking step parent. "What. What's so important you need to bug me about?" I snap. He becomes angrier. "Don't you dare use that tone with me Maureen!" he says in a dangerous voice. "I am your father and-" I cut him off."MY FATHER!!!" I yell, to emphasize I'm pissed off. "YOU. ARE NOT. MY FATHER! YOU... YOU... UGH!" I say my voice pitching to a near scream."I was made your legal guardian when I married your mother! So I AM your father!" he yells, these screaming fights are often, I should be used to them. "God Minx! You need to grow up and start acting your age! You can't keep throwing these baby fits of yours!" he says trying to calm down."No. I won't act my age. I'm going to make your life a living hell like you've made mine! I didn't ever want you in our life! All you are is a rich snob, I don't even care if your rich! I didn't want a random guy to come along and try to replace my father." I say looking him straight in the eye. I see the muscles in his jaw twitching. He has no idea what to say. Good cause I'm not really looking for an answer, just looking for a sign I've wont this fight. "And dont you ever call me Minx, Cause your not my dad." I say as i back up to the door fore my ultimate escape.
