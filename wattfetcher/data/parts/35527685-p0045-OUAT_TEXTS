RobinInDaHood : Hey Regina, how's Zelena doing?
YourMajesty: Still got the baby still not dead.
RobinInDaHood : I'm sorry I let this happen
YourMajesty : It's the witches fault, not yours
RobinInDaHood : Thank you for not taking out your anger on me or Zelena.
YourMajesty : I'm the better person. I will not stoop down to Zelenas level.
RobinInDaHood: I'm so proud of you!
TruestBeliever : Me too!
RobinInDaHood : And maybe one day you and I could have a child.
TruestBeliever : EWWWWWW
TruestBeliever has logged off
RobinInDaHood : Now that it's just the two of us...
YourMajesty : I have to tell you something.
RobinInDaHood : Are you breaking up with me?!?
YourMajesty: Noooo! But I can't have children.
RobinInDaHood : we will still have Roland and Henry. I love you no matter what.
Snow: Awwwww THE FEELS!
