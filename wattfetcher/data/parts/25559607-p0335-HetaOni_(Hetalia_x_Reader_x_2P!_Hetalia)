Clicking his tongue, Japan spoke, "How could we be sure?!"



Before anything could even be solved, they started attacking each other again. "No! Stop fighting! Hey!" I tried calling out, but they still kept going.



I don't understand what's going on anymore.



Were the 2Ps really going to kill me? Or did they want to send me back home?

Did the 1Ps really start this fight? Or did they get attacked in the first place?






The insanity.



The insanity just increases with every moment in this mansion, huh?




I don't know what I should do. How will I be able to stop this now? Giving a shaky sigh, I took a step back. As I did so, my heel bumped into something.




Little did I know that the insanity was going to reach it's peak...and I was its prey.




I turned around to see what it was that I bumped into. My eyes widened when I did.







It was a large sack.





It was the same sack that I saw Luciano carry with him not too long ago. I thought it would be my parents in here, but I was wrong. Now that I can see it up close, I don't think it was big enough for two people. But what was inside it, then?
