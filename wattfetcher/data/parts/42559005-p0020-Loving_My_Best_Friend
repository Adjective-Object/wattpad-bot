i smile and start cooking.i grab the pan and turn the stove on, and put the meat on. while its cooking i start cutting the tomatoes , and tear up the lettuce.
while i was cutting the tomatoes my phone start ringing, looked over and then.....cut my damn finger.
"MOTHER FUCKER!" i yell. I run to the sink and put my finger under the water, i see the cut and its not that bad, not that deep where i need stitches.....thank god.
i run upstairs and get the first aid kit and put a bandaid on it.
"we have arrived!" i hear sammy yell. i giggle. i walk downstairs and see them putting the groceries up.
"thank you baby" i say kissing him. "no problem" he says winking.
"dinner is almost ready, i just need to finish cutting the tomatoes " i say.
i finish, and put the tomatoes, lettuce, and meat each in its own bowl, and put the taco shells on big platter.
"hey johnson!" i yell. "what" he says walking up to me. "help me set the table?" i say "sure"."thanks, just get the plates ,silverware and cups, while i take the food and stuff" he nods.
we set the table and call everyone to dinner.
after everyone ate we made sundaes and watched movies._________________"i feel like this is going to be a good summer" i tell jack who was bringing me the dishes and cleaning up.
"yeah me too, especially now that we're together" he says kissing my cheek. i smile.
