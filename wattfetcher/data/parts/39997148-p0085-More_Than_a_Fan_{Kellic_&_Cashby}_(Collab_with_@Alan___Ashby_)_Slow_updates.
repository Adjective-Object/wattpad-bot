"So were we." Austin said.
"Let's just all eat together then." Kellin said.
"Sounds good."
"Where should we go?" I asked as we all started walking.
"How does IHOP sound?"
"Sounds good to me."  I said and looked over at Kellin, "What do you say babe?"
"Food sounds great."
"True." Alan said.
"Then lets go."
"So how'd it happen? Did you just ask him out of nowhere or was it really sweet?" Alan asked as we walked.
"It was out of no where." Kellin said, "Completely caught me off guard."
"Really?"
"Yeah but it's whatever. It was a little spontaneous if you ask me."
"And he loved it." I said laughing.
"But the best part was when he tried to kiss me." Kellin giggled.
"Don't tell them that."
"He knocked foreheads with me."
Alan laughed, "Are you serious? That's great."
"You had one job Vic.One." Austin said laughing.
"I was in shock okay? I was freaking out that he said yes and I didn't know what to do!"
"Wow. Kellin, he's a keeper."
"I am."
"We'll see."
"What's that supposed to mean?" I asked.
"Nothing just nothing."
"No, don't do that." I whined, "Tell me."
"Just hush up."
"Jeez okay fine." I said and crossed my arms. We all kept talking before we finally got to IHOP.
We were seated quickly and a waitress took our order.
"Oh Vic. You or one of the guys should stop by the bus. I have pictures for you guys." Alan said.
"Alright, I'll have to do it after my interview but I'll be by to check them out."
"Awesome. I have a  few up on my website too."
"Awesome, so are you having fun on tour so far?" I asked as the waitress brought us our drinks and I gave Kellin a look as he took a sip of his coffee.
"Its something. I have to get a new phone today because certain people, but it's alright."
"It was not my fault." Austin said, "You're the one who jinxxed it."
"I didn't jinx anything." He said, "You tipped the boat and we fell in."
"Oh my." Kellin said but they ignored him.
Austin shook his head, "Nope you jinxxed it when you said it was like that little mermaid scene."
"That doesn't mean anything."
"Yes it does and you're not the only who has to get a new phone."
"Wait you tipped a boat?" I asked getting confused.
"Yes Austin tipped a boat. He took me on our first date yesterday and then we went on a small row boat he ended up tipping it over."
