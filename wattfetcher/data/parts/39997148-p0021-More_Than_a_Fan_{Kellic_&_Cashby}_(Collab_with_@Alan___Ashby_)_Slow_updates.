I looked down at the picture, "Oh it makes everything look round." I said.
"Yeah, but it's one of my favorite lenses."
"It looks really cool." I said as he started taking other pictures.  Another half hour and we had to head back towards the stage. I had to talk with the guys about our set and he had to do camera stuff. The rest of the band was sitting around with the guys from Pierce.
"Hey guys." I said waving to them.
"Hey man." Tino said as I sat down.
"What are you guys doing?"
"Just talking." Phil said kicking his feet up on the small table.
"That's boring."
"How was hanging out Alan talking most likely things you didn't even know."
"It was cool I learned a couple of things." I said smiling.
"Uh huh, like what?"
"Like Alan's favorite lense to use is the fisheye lense." I said smugly.
"Oh wow. That's something."
"Yes it is."
We sat around talking for awhile before Pierce had to up and go play.
"Have fun guys!" I called as they ran onto stage.
"What song are we starting with?" Tino asked, "Was it The Calm or something else?"
"Yeah it's The Calm." I told him.
He nodded, "Alright."
"I'm gonna go watch Pierce." I told them getting up and walking to side stage.
I leaned against the side and watched the guys perform and they were absolutely killing it.  I sang along softly to myself as they jumped around and played a great show like always.I also watched Alan take pictures of the whole time, the look on his face was absolutely adorable. He looks so concentrated.
Man he was really fucking cute.
Once Pierces set was finished the guys all ran off stage, "Good job guys."
"Thanks." They said.
"Kill it." Vic said patting my back.
"We will don't worry." I said as the guys all got up.
It took about fifteen minutes for our crew to set all our stuff up.
"First show of the tour guys! Let's kill it!" I shouted.
"It's going to be epic!" Phil yelled right before we ran out on stage.
Our set went by quicker than I liked it to. I felt like it was too soon for me to be thanking the fans for coming out.  I felt rushed but it was a hell of a show for the first night.
"That was an amazing way to start off the tour." I said falling back onto the couch in the bus.
"Hell yeah it was." Phil said fallin next to me.
"Let's just hope the rest of the tour goes this way." Aaron said sitting down.
"It will, it always goes fucking amazing."
A couple of minutes later the rest of the band and Alan came walking in and sat down.
"Hey." He said not looking up from his camera.
"Hey, did you get any good pictures?" I asked.
