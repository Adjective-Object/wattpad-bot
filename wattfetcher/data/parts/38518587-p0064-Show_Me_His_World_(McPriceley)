"Thomas?" Kevin said, shaking the smaller man's shoulders. "Wake up buddy."
Thomas raised his head out of the the crook of his elbow and blinked in the fluorescent lights.
"Go home Thomas." Kevin said gently as Thomas arched his back and yawned. He rubbed his eyes and licked his lips before straightening his tie with a determined expression. "No, I've got to finish editing." He said gruffly.
Kevin rolled his eyes, but internally he glowed with pride. To Kevin, Thomas was like a publishing protégé and he wanted to groom the younger man into something incredible. Maybe one day, when Kevin was ready to retire to his Florida beach house, he'd leave the magazine to Thomas.
"Let me get you some of my secret weapon." Kevin said before leaving the office. When he returned he had a bottle of whiskey in one hand and two glasses in the other. He placed the cups on the table and filled each with a charitable amount of alcohol. "Drink with me Poptarts." Kevin said in a French accent.
Thomas took a cup and downed it in one go before slamming it back onto the desk with a drowsy grin. Kevin watched him with wide eyes. For an hour they drank together, Kevin trying to one-up Thomas unsuccessfully. Thomas beat Kevin every time they raced to finish a fresh glass and Kevin couldn't comprehend where Thomas was keeping all of that whiskey in his compact body.
Kevin rubbed his hands together excitedly, ready to educate young Thomas on how to conduct business while chugging whiskey. Together, they got through the editing process in a third of the time it would've taken one person.
