Once there was a girl, a young girl, hardly a teen. Yet, she had experienced so much already. She was a faller, as I call them. She fell for certain people, yet always turned out to be the wrong people. They weren't necessarily bad people or players, although there were a few. No, these people were different. They were her perfect definition of a boyfriend, in that time. They were mostly good people that could really make a difference and really made a difference in her life. But there was one in particular, one she could never forget, he was classified as Â the Song Theif.
