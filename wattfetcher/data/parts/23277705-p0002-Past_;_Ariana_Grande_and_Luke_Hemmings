"So whatcha doing out here, if you don't mind me asking?" He questions, turning his body so facing me. He's so polite.
"Um... Well I needed air, cold air, it always make feel like I'm still here alive, right now," I explain, actually feeling relieved to let that out.
"Oh..... You're that type of gal, huh?" He states, smirking. At first he sounds sad but then try's to forget about it.
"What's that supposed to mean?" I gasp, trying not to giggle at his comment.
"You're the type of gal who likes the cold air, that's what I meant," He chuckles, moving his feet in the snow.
"To be honest I wasn't, i just started liking it a few weeks ago," I flip my hair back, and glancing at the scenery as I think about the boy I loved that left.
"Oh, cool," He nods, rubbing his hands together, since he didn't have on gloves on like muah. "Hey, can I get your name?"
"It's Ariana," I answer him, not looking towards him. I hope we don't get to close cause this gal is not trying to be more heart broken then she already is.
"Mines Luke," He answers proudly.
"Luke," I repeat, finding myself smiling for some odd reason.

A/N:
Hello beautiful people, this is the new Lariana book of mine.
For some reason I feel like I shouldn't say Lariana cause when I searched up Lariana books on here I saw some Luke Brooks and Ariana Grande stories, so I not really sure.
But anyway I know you're probably wondering if I'm ever gonna update the other Luke Hemmings and Ariana Grande stories and my other stories, yes I am but if haven't noticed I do go to school so that stresses me, so I'm not able to write and update. I will soon I promise that.
:D
Hope you like this,
