Andy took me back to the house with Kellin. He stormed up to the room and began to pack spare clothes that his pack had gave him. I nodded at Kellin and entered the room. Clothes were on the bed and in suitcases. I walked to the center of the room and saw Andy in the drawers. He turned, looked at me and went back to packing without a word. I crossed my arms and looked at him while he packed.
"Kellins going to sent a Cab to take us to the airport." He said to me. I sat down on the bed and looked at my hand as it began to shake. I havent eaten anything in days.  Andy looked up at me and saw my hand. He walked over to the Fridge and pulled a blood pack out. He threw across the room and it landed at my feet.
"I dont need it." I say rejecting it. I hated the taste of packaged blood.
"You sure? Its been a few days since you've last ate something." I shake my head and pick up a bag.We head towards the door and leave the house. A cab was waiting for us. We got inside and it took off.
"So how will we be getting to our destination." I ask. I shuffle in the seat and look at the driver.
"He's a part of another pack and he won't say anything"
"Its just something feels wrong." I say getting a feeling again. Andy raised an eyebrow.
"What do you mean?"
"My finac√®. Hes close by." Andy closed his eyes to focus. I get nervous as his prescence gets closer.
He hit the back of the seat.
"Stop the cab." As the cab stopped another car speeds towards us and hits us, flipping the cab.
Andy grabbed me and keep me safe from harm but the glass shattered and got stuck in my skin and I started to bleed. Glass covered Andys back and his face as the cab stops moving. He looked around and growled before looking at me. I look down to see the deep cut on my stomach as it continues to bleeding.Andy bit his wrist and quickly pulled the glass out and dripped blood into my wound and it healed slowly.
"Please stay with me. I can't survive with out you..." He sobbed and held me.
