I can remember the snowy days of winter, Watching The Hunger Games And talking to my best friend via Twitter. I can remember listening to acoustic songs, And not eating very much- Stuck in the mindset that not eating would make me forget, But two months later, I still thought of you. You were the ghost haunting my every move, Even after 6 months of not contacting you. I can remember listening to Touch (by Troye Sivan), While writing my book. I thought of you alot. But now, I realize that I have moved on, It didn't just happen at once, I slowly began to forget your sweet words, Piece back together my walls you broke down, And I have found someone- Well she found me- Who gives me feelings that can't compare to the flimsy promises you gave me. So keep your memories in your ash tray, Because I've spent enough time dwelling on it. - (m.m)
