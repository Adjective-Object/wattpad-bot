I'm going to start out with saying that I love crackers. and this graphic adventure. this pic makes logic. of course you need crackers, but not if your cracklackin. but think. that could mean you are amazing, or that you are actually lacking crackers. Which would be sad. but the fact that Jen is wearing sunglasses seals the deal. she just looks so professional, and then the dude is just like "Jen do we have any crackers?" And she just appears around the corner and totally rocks her answer- "Nah. we cracklackin." oh. so heart warmingFound on: the funny pics app. ðŸ˜€
