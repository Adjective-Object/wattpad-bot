I sat here watching TV when the commercial came on! My name is Kira. I'm a girl, and I'm looking for a job. Luckily I've always liked Freddy Fazbears's Pizza. It's the best place ever!! I decided to sign up for the night watch. It'll be fun to look through the cameras and see my favorite bear! But I mostly liked Foxy. He's funny to me! I went to the restaurant at midday and talked to the manager.
"So your name is Kira, and you are in high school still? I believe in 10th grade and how's it going there" The manager explained and asked. I nodded.
"Yeah I'm ok, I guess. It's kind of hard with math, but I think I'm going to do great here" I said excited.
"Ok then let's get you started" the manager said excited. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So what did you guys think about this?!?! It was so awesome right?! So yeah the first chapter! Please do enjoy this book!!!! ^â€¢^
