So guys
Most of my real life friends see my and this is how they describe me
"Always fricking happy."
But the weird thing is if I get like a paper cut they will think wrong and threaten me like
"Look, I swear I will put hand sanitizer on a rock and rub it on tht cut if you do It again."
So I just smile and get up and put hand sanitizer on it myself
XD the look on their faces is priceless
Anyways
DONT YOU HATE IT WHEN TEACHERS SAY"I didn't even give you a lot of homework."
Homework:-write a five page essay about one moment of your life-write another essay on a book-write another essay on food
I'm just like"Saying you didn't give us a lot of homework is like saying,'Sandy isn't obsessed with Nico.'"
It'sLike
You don't just lie to me like that
No, never
Then I don't do the homework and I do it in the morning
And then
I die of boredom.
Guys I haven't had Nutella in a month, I'm sooooooo depressed
It's like;-; whyyyyyyyyy
I haven't ate skittles either
:(
Oh well
MOVING ON
so I wanna have a fight with my friends where it goes like this
(What I say is in bold)
"Nerd"
"Jerk"
"Idiot."
"Buttface!"
"Gay!"
"And proud!" *sticks tongue out defiantly*
And then we just stare at each other awkwardly
