I think it was later in the fall. The lights were out. Adele and I were in bed when one of our many fights broke out. I had too many of the covers, she was too far over on my side, or she was trying to keep me from sucking my thumb? We argued.

Mother came tearing into the bedroom, belt in hand. She lashed at the bed screaming, "Annalyn, I'll teach you to keep us up all hours of the night." With another slap of the belt, she demanded, "Get yourself out of that bed, right now young lady. I'll teach you...."

As usual I held my arms and hands up trying to protect my face as I sled down off the side of that high bed onto the cold hard wood floor.

She lashed at my legs, screaming, "You know your daddy has to get up at five each morning and you carrying on just...." There was a rhythm to her beating. I got a lick with each word.

I pleaded, "Mummy please stop, pease — pease — stop — I...." I begged, as I danced to the biting and stinging of the back of my thighs and calves, my little buttocks burned.

Like always, her one hand held me by my shoulder and she beat me with the belt with the other. Threatening, "Annalyn if you run, you'll get more."

I cried, hopping from one leg to the other, "Please Mummy—  pease stop — I'll be good — promise — I'm sorry — sorry — I promise I won't do it anymore — I won't...." I couldn't hold back the tears and sobs.

She yelled and continued whipping. As she got tired, I got a hit with each phrase, "Stop that crying." Whack. "Or you'll get more." Whack. "Your daddy can't sleep." Another whack. "With all that crying and carryings on."

I held my breath and my body rigid. One last lash. She stopped, exhausted. Sobs heaved out of me.

Now, out of breath, she ordered me into the large walk in closet where all the family clothes hung, "Get yourself in that closet so we can't hear all that carryings on — and you get yourself together." The door slammed behind me.

Inside, in the dark, somewhere a big wicker clothes basket sat under the long dresses and suits. I stumbled over Daddy's shoes, big enough to put both of my feet in. I tripped over Mummy's high heels; poking the arches of my tiny bare feet. I felt my way along big, scratchy wool suits, and Mother's long fine wool, soft silk, and gabardine dresses. I smelled a sachet of Mother's sweet perfume, Daddy's spicy aftershave, wool, and moth balls permeating the air. My nose was running, sobbing tears flowed down my cheeks, my backside was on fire. I found the basket, and crawled into it sucking my thumb and crying—   and crying — and — crying. I couldn't stop crying. Then I couldn't get my breath and I started hyperventilating. I got hysterical.

Mother called Dr. Brice. When she hung up the phone, she told Daddy, "Dr. Brice said go get her, put her in bed between us, and hold her, she'll stop, she'll be all right." Daddy grumbled. She came.

That's when I learned the pattern. Get beat. Get comfort.
