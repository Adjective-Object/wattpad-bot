"Mikey," was all Billie could manage as a thank you. Mike rubbed Billie Joe's back in slow large circles and held him close.
After getting Billie settled down, Mike slowly changed him in some of his old clothes. He tried to find things that were too small for him, but even those didn't fit Billie Joe. He was dressed in a baggy t shirt and pants that went past his feet. Mike couldn't help but smile at how adorable he looked.
Billie fell asleep before Mike could ask him if he wanted water. He sighed hoping that the man wouldn't get dehydrated. Gently, Mike laid Billie down on the bed and covered him in the large blankets. He brushed Billie Joe's hair off his forehead and planted a friendly kiss.
He looked back at Billie snoring lightly before he left the room. A single tear left his eye just watching the poor man sleep. Mike turned the light off leaving on a sad note.
He made his way to his bedroom, forgetting all about the dinner that he never got to eat.
