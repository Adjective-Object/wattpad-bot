"No. Morse get out of the car. You two get out as well. You guys aren't leaving the school or my sight." I said.
"Look kid. I need you to back up before I run you over. They haven't answered police questions so they are going to." The guy said.
"Greg, calm down. I promise to get it over with soon." Morse said.
I hadn't voluntarily moved. I was pulled back by someone and the guy just drove off. I felt something wrong though. I looked up to see a man. His scent. It wasn't right though. It was off. It smells like he was just in a fight. It also looked like it. His face had a smudge of blood on the side. I could faintly smell it or see it.
"Hey kid. You need to be careful of who you're talking to like that."
"Who do you think you are? You can't tell me what to do. Also why is there blood on your face?" I felt stupid for saying the last part, I didn't even mean to as well.
