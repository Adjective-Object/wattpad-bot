When I was done direction Ashton on the way to my apartment, I leaned back in the backseat and closed my eyes.The drive was about 20 minutes, so why not take a nap? Ashton and Michael's conversation quickly became distant, like listening ti then through a wall. Soon enough their voices disappeared completely and I drifted into a deep sleep.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was standing in the middle of a street, cold wind was thrown in my face like a punch. There was people everywhere, but they didn't seem to notice me as they walked straight past me. I looked around, trying to figure out where I was. I felt a slight relief as I saw Michael's house. At least I was somewhere familiar. I looked around more, before peaking over at the streetlight across his house. And there he was.The boy with black eyes. He stood there staring at me. I backed away as he started making his was towards me. I started running to Michael's house, almost falling over several times. I swung the door open practically fell inside, slamming and locking the door shut behind me.
I got up on my feet again, panting. I turned around, expecting to see the cozy hallway, but no. I was in a cafe. Not just some random cafe. I was in the cafe I met Calum at. The room was empty of people, except for someone sitting in the corner. The lights were dim and flickering. I felt my pulse increase. The place was completely trashed. "This isn't right" I mumbled, and almost jumped out of my own skin when the person in the corner spoke up. "Oh, yes it is." I recognized the voice right away. It was Calum. I looked over at him, to see him balancing some weird looking knife on his middle finger. "What's going on?" I stuttered, barely loud enough for myself to hear. "That's a very good question, darling." I stepped closer to him, wanting to catch a glance of his face, which I couldn't. "I'm dreaming, aren't I? Why am I here?" to my surprise, Calum just chuckled darkly before standing up, now holding the knife properly.
"As if you don't know." he accused me, making me furrow my eyebrows. He walked closer, standing right in front of me. "What the hell are you-" I couldn't finish my sentence before feeling a sharp pain in my chest. I looked down and saw the knife in my chest with a pool of blood taking form at my feet. I looked back up at Calum, who smiled wickedly at me as his eyes turned black. He pulled out the knife and was about to stab me again when-
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I jumped up screaming, shaking and crying. "Hey, hey, hey! It's alright!" It was Ashton who was shaking me awake. We were in my driveway, parked safe & sound. I exhaled a breath I didn't know I was holding and embraced Ashton in a hard hug. He seemed taken back by my gesture, but hugged back quickly. "Bad dream?" he asked soothingly. I nodded and sobbed into his chest. "The worst." He stroke my hair, calming me down. Ashton pulled away and wiped away some tears from my face. "You're alright. Whatever you were dreaming about, it wasn't real. You're safe now." I nodded and smiled at him through the tears. "Where's Michael?" I asked as i noticed his absence. "I dropped him off at the store down the street, said he had to pick up some stuff." Ashton explained. "OK," I replied before trying to step out of the car. Once my feet made contact with the cold and wet concrete, I felt a shiver go up my spine.
"Come on, let's go inside." I said as I turned towards the apartmentbuildning. "Which level do you live on?" Ashton asked, looking up at the tall construction. "13th" I answered as we entered the main door. "Is it OK if we take the elevator?" I asked, pushing the button. "Yeah, s'alright" Ashton smiled before stepping into the elevator with me. "Can I push the button?! Pleeeeease!" he begged, making me giggle. "Yeah, sure." I answered and his face lit up. "Yay!" he cheered before pressing the button. I looked at my self in the elevator-mirror. I looked disgusting. I leaned closer and rubbed my sore eyes. I looked down at my lip, to see something red in the corner of my mouth. I touched it and hissed in pain. I probably bit myself while having the nightmare. When I looked back up I saw someone standing behind me. It was Calum, with coal-black eyes. He was grinning. I shrieked and turned around, only to see a confused Ashton. "Hey, what's wrong?" he looked concerned. "Oh, um, nothing. Just thought I saw a spider." I nervously chuckled. He rolled his eyes and huffed. "Girls" I hit his shoulder, and he faked a hurt face. "C'mon, were here." I said as the elevator dinged and the doors opened.
