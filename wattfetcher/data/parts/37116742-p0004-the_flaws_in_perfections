Is it happiness to cry in an unfamiliar bathroom, surrounded by an unsettling white tone?
Or to lay helplessly on the shower floor, pretending to be ignorant of all the potential health hazards?
The feelings of anger sadness and deceit circle around like a tornado in the mind. This isn't how people should live.
Used, left deflated and empty on a hotel floor with hard cheap carpet leaving imprints on the backs of legs and the sides of cheeks.
They come and they go.
An inability to entertain anyone long enough or thoroughly enough to have what would be called a friend.
Leeches suck what they can and leave with full stomachs.
Cruel to create a sick, false sense of acceptance that has yet to be true. Only to make a sudden departure of fate.
Loneliness is the only thing that is guaranteed to return.
Time after time. For always.
