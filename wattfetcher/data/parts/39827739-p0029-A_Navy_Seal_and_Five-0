"Thanks Max" I said and walked over to Kylie who was leaning against the Camaro watching our vic be put in Max's truck. She looked close to tears and I wouldn't blame her. No one her age should die like our vic.
"Hey" I told her and she looked at me and gave me one of her little smiles.
"Hey" Kylie said and returned her gaze to the Medical Examiner's truck.
"You okay?"
"No, why would someone kill someone, no an innocent teenager, like that?" she asked and a tear started rolling down her cheek. I pulled her into a hug because I knew she needed one.
"I don't know, Kylie but we will find who killed her. If you don't want to I won't make you work this case" I told her. She looked up with determination in her eyes. I knew that look, it was the look that said she wanted to help or do something and no one could stop her.
"I want to help catch the person who did that to her. She's deserves to rest in peace" she told me and I smiled because this was the Kylie I knew, the determined little girl who solves puzzles and won't rest until all of the puzzle pieces fit.
