Flail ending (HECK YES SECOND BROKEN CAMERA TODAY!)Note: this is Phone Guy again. Marionette's stinky farts caused everyone to pass out except for BB, Purple Guy, and Mangle, who has no sense of smell whatsoever. And Buttons. She's a doll( literally) so she can't smell. So now she's airing the place out. Remember to do dares, requests, truths and other randomness. Asta la Pasta!~
