"We never knew you sing!" Fumiko, Chieko, and Hiroki exclaimed.
Kazu laughed nervously and rubbed the back of his head. "Was I bad?" he asked.
"No, you were terrible," Isamu said, playfully smiling.
Chieko elbowed Isamu.
"Thanks," Kazu said. "Now, as a reward, I would like a group hug!"
"You don't have to ask me twice!" Hiroki said, practically tackling Kazu. Fumiko and Chieko joined in afterwards.
"Come now, Isamu," Kazu said. "You were the one that forced me into it."
"Hugs will just ruin my complexion," Isamu answered.
Fumiko pulled Isamu in anyways. He scowled at them afterwards, but they secretly knew that he liked it. The rest of their time at he festival was filled with fun. When it was finally midnight, they all retired to theirs beds.
