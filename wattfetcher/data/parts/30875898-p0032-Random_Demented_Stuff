A/N- This isn't the best but I wanted to put it up anyway.
All I need is for someone to not walk away
All I need is for someone to actually stay
All I need is someone to except me for who I am
All I need is someone to give a damn
All I need is a person to not kick me down
All I need is a person to not walk by me and frown
All I need is the person that doesn't make me depressed
All I need is my razor to put me to rest
