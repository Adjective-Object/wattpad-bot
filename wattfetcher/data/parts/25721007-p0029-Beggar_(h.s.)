Harry's POV
Tonight I was planning to have the best time of my life. I finally have the girl I've been desperately wanting for three years. Our date turned into the worst night of my life when she came running out of the bathroom telling me bad news.
The two words, I'm pregnant, keep repeating in my mind as I look at her in complete shock. I know exactly who is the cause of this mess. The first thing I'm going to do is beat his ass for getting her knocked up and then ruining our perfect date.
"Harry," Lennon chirps, "Please say something, anything."
The problem is, I'm speechless at the moment. Without telling her, I dart to my car and she quickly tries to follow behind me. We both get in the vehicle and I zoom to the prison he was sent to.
"Where are we going?" She asks with worry in her gorgeous eyes. I'm not sure if it's because of my driving or my loss of words.
"I'm going to beat the shit out of Brock for doing this to us," I growl. All the sudden, every car stops in front of me. Of course I'm stuck at a damn red light.
"First of all, he's in jail, Harry. Second, I think you mean me because you don't have to actually deal with the fact of being raped by the person you hate the most then getting pregnant because of it," she states making a good point.
"You're right Lennon but, I do have to deal with it in some way. I have to see the girl I love get hurt by my bastard of a stepfather," I tell her, turning my head to face hers.
"I.. I'm so scared Harry. I don't know what I'm going to do," she starts to cry. I feel completely bad for her. This must be the worst feeling in the world.
"Baby, it'll be alright. I'll be here by your side no matter what you choose to do about the situation. Okay?" I assure her and hold on to her shaky hand.
"Okay," she agrees.
The light finally turns green again and my head is consumed with thoughts. I really don't know what we're going to do about the baby. I'm not sure if she would ever be comfortable with having an abortion. The other option is to carrying the thing until she has it then give it up for adoption. In the worst case scenario, she would keep the child, raising it as her own. I'd feel sick to my stomach if she didn't at least give the baby away. It would be Brock's actual child and her's.
New York City Police Department is carved on the building standing next to my parked car. Before I get out, I say, "Stay in here while I deal with this please."
"This is my choice too. My child," she argues and I let her win. We both hop out of the black vehicle.
Hand in hand, we walk up the steps of the department and enter the building. I can tell she's as nervous as I am by her shaky movements. To let her know I'm by her side, I give her hand a light squeeze.
"I'm here to visit Brock Styles," I inform the man at the front desk. He gives me a look I can't read then calls someone on the phone.
"Follow them," the officer gestures to the two guards standing behind us. Lennon gulps out of nothing but fear. My poor girl.
We trot behind the two buff men, watching their every move then doing the same. They lead us down a hallway full of prison cells. Creepy prison men whistle our way obviously to Lennon. I pull her closer to me, wrapping my hand around her waist showing her she's safe.
Lennon's POV
I am beyond scared at the moment. Waking down the hallways during eight thirty at night in a prison is not the most comforting feeling. The criminals whistle and shout perverted words as we walk by their cells. Harry pulls me closer to him assuring me I'm safe in his arms.
