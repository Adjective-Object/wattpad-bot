Hannah's POV:
And I wrap you up, wanna kiss your lips. I wanna make you feel wanted. Hunter Hayes blares out of my phone. That means it could only be Daddy! I answer and forget all about my shoes. "Hey, daddy! " I answer happily. "Hey, sweetie." He says back. "So, what's going on?" I ask. "Well, I have 2 more meetings then I'm coming home !" He exclaims surprising me. "Yay!! And it's my senior skip day today! " I say now putting on my shoes. "Yes, but I have to drive. Yknow how long it takes to get from Toronto. 15 hours and 26 minutes. " he says as I gasp loudly. "You also have to rest and eat." I say grabbing my stuff abd going out the bedroom door. "Yes, so it'll take 2 days, and from then and untill June 1st I'm off." He says as I turn down the music. "Yay! I'm sorry daddy, but I gotta do babysit." I say sadly. "Okay pumpkin. I'll see you later. I love you." He says as Kayla comes in. "I love you too, bye." I say hanging up. "Oh, was that Paul or Benson?" Kayla says as Tessa and Ryan come down. "Neither, it was my dad,." I say. "Okay, before we go, I have 1 rule. Tasha and the others will tell you more about their own." Tessa says seriously. We nod and sit down. "You haven't met Malaki yet, have you?" She asks as Lady Geek comes and sits in her lap. We shake our heads no. "Don't stare at Malaki." She says seriously. 'Why?" Kayla asks. "Well, he has a walker, and he can't walk without it. He will crawl, and that's okay. He's pretty skinny and bony." She says pushing her hair into her signature ponytail. We all nod, as she stands up and gets her keys. We get up and grab our stuff and go outside. "So, Ryan and I'll be taking his car and you and Kayla will be taking hers?" Tessa asks as Ryan locks up the house. I  nod and go the car. "Follow us. We're going to the county." Tessa says getting in the car with Ryan.

As we, started driving on the dirt road. Kayla put on Eminem's Berserk, and tried to rap to hit but horribly failed. We laugh and focus on the road. "So does Ashton have everything ?" I ask as pass a cow farm. "Yes. So we agreed on Saturday at 3pm right ?." She says. I nod and push my hair back. "Do you think he'll like it?" She asks worryingly. "Of course, he will." I say as we pull up to see a couple of kids playing soccer, some more playing baseball, and Florida Georgia Line blaring outta the house. "That must be Malaki, Izic, and Zoii." Kayla saying pointing out them. "And that must be Marissa, Emily, and Bridgett." I say also pointing them out. " That's Tyler, Mae, and Naomi." We both say together and laugh. We park on the grass, ans the kids start running over. Tessa and Ryan get out of the car, and Tessa gets attacked by hugs and questions. A door opens and closes. Here comes TJ, Elijah, and Seth. "Look,daddy it's Aunty Tessa !" Naomi yells. The men all try and get the kids off of Tessa. TJ is the first to hug Tessa and she hugs him back too. Then Seth,  then Elijah. "So, where are my sisters?" Tessa asks happily as she just reintroduced us. "Being women." TJ says as he pushes his hair back. Tessa fake punches him and puts her hands in her pockets. The kids go off to play, and we go inside.
