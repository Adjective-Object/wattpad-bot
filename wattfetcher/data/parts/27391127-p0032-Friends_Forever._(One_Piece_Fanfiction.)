Hello minna! Today, depending on what I feel like this may be a double or triple update. Haruka, Aya and Sakura might not appear during these chapters.

As I said, might. As author, I have the right to control whatever happens in the book. *evil smirk*

Picture is young Twilight.

Well, onto the story!

Sayo and Gemi just bowed. What were mere children in the eyes of the World Government?

Saint Jean had his rifle pointed at the poor girl whilst mumbling some stuff about him being a descendant of being one of the 20 kings.... poor Millie was there shaking.

At that time, Queen Miriam and King Leon came running in and they knew they couldn't do anything.

Just as Saint Jean was about to pull the trigger, his sister, Saint Marie pulled it away from him.

"Aniki dear, you can't hurt this poor child." St.Marie said. She was about the same height as him with the same suit and hairstyle expect for the fact that her hair was blonde.

"She's such a cute little girl, pun-pun."

"Dumb blonde." Everyone muttered under their breaths.

"But she'll make an excellent slave."

"S-Slave?" Millie stuttered.

"Bring the branding iron!"

"YOU CAN'T DO THAT!" Sayo yelled.

"YEAH. LEAVE OUR SISTER ALONE!" Gemi agreed.

"Gemi-nee. Sayo-nee."

"Pardon me." King leo pardoned whilst making his children bow down again.

"You must be that shitty king who were supposed to meet us." St.Jean stated rather coldly.

"Yes and the one you are trying to make a slave is my daughter." The King stated, bravely standing up to the Noble.

He something that only the insane dare to do as this may occur the wrath of a Marine Admiral....and nobody wants to mess with those guys.

St.Jean, feeling so offended, shot the King in his shoulders. Loud gasps and cries were heard as the entire kingdom was scared to lose their monarch.

"Otou-san!" Millie cried. St.Marie then appeared next to the King, who already lost more blood than he should.
