"When am I not safe thunder?" I glared at her. She called me that because I was extremely loud and scary. "Hey, you started it." We laughed it off "And I will explain everything one day. Love you sis." She smiled.
"Good." I smiled "And hey just call Chrissy like you used to ok?" I asked.
"As long as you call me Anna." She smirked. I hated to call her Anna instead Id always call her Annie or Ann.
"Fine" we laughed and shook our heads. "Now go get my boyfri- Charlie." I covered horribly. I shoved my face into my hand and peeked at savannah through my fingers only to find her smirking again. "Go." I dropped my hand into my lap and shot her a death stare. She shook her head and grabbed her leather jacket and left. I heard her start her bike and drive away until the sound vanished.
I took a hot shower and changed into a tank top and shorts. I started humming some song I heard awhile ago and went to my bed. I grabbed my laptop from inside the nightstand drawer and laid down on my stomach with the laptop in front of me. I held myself up by my elbows while I went on YouTube and looked for funny videos until I got tired. I put my iPod in the dock and put the music up to a volume where it was audible but not loud enough for you to hear from a far distance. My music always drifts me to sleep and that's what it did once again.
