I feel anger bubble up inside of me at the thought of my love being hurt by her own sister.
Sirius speaks up as he opens a chocolate frog, "Shouldn't you two be at a prefect meeting?"
We look at each other and rush out of the compartment and down to corridor. "Remus, can we talk after the meeting?" I ask.
"Of course, Prongs."
We reach the Head's compartment and slip inside. Remus goes to sit next to the other prefects while I walk towards Lily, who I'm guessing is Head Girl. Lily turns around to look at me. I give her a small smile.
"You're Head Boy, Potter?!" She says, surprise written all over her face. She turns away and mutters something that sounds quite like "Has Dumbledore gone mad?"
I sit down next to her and pull out some parchments, "Lily," I say to get her attention.
"No, I won't go out with you, Potter," she says emotionless, not even looking up from her parchment.
"I wasn't going to ask you out, Lily. I was going to show you the patrol schedule I made," I hand her the parchment.
She turns a bit red, "Oh! Um... this looks just fine. It's usable."
The next hour Lily and I take turns discussing all of the prefect rules and explaining the patrols and whatnot to the prefects. We hand out the schedules and Lily hastily walks away. Remus walks over and sits down where Lily sat.
I begin to talk, "So, the plan for me to get Lily-"
Remus cuts me off, "Prongs, I've told you this over the summer. Use magic only for class and sensible entertainment. Don't ask Lily out every chance you get. Lastly, try being her friend before anything else."
I nod, "Thanks, Moony."
He smiles at me and stands up, clapping my shoulder, "Now, how about we go back to the compartment and feast on chocolate frogs while Sirius gushes about Marlene."
I chuckle and stand up. We head back to our compartment and I sit down thinking this year is going to be a whole lot different.
