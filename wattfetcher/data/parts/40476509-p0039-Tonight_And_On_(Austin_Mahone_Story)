Amanda's P.O.V.
I was on my phone just sitting on the couch, I had asked Quadira if she want to come over 10 minutes ago and she said "yeah". I told her she could bring Sam if she wanted, "Yeah I'll bring him we'll be there in about 10 minutes.
*9 minutes later*
Then Austin came downstairs.
Austin: Hey Babe, come here please.
I got up and walked half way to him. Then the doorbell rang.
Me: Hold on one second, I'm gonna get that.
I opened the door and saw Quadira and Sam outside.
Me: Hey, come on in.
Quadira: Hey
Austin: Hey guys what's up?
Sam: Hey man what's going' on?
Austin: Nothin' much bro, just gotta talk to Amanda in private real quick then we can hang out.
Sam: Alright man.
Austin: We'll be right back.
He grabbed my hand after I closed the door and locked. He brong me to the bathroom that was under the staircase and closed the door behind us.
Me: What's up Babe?
Austin: Um, I just wanted to see if you still had any bruises or cuts.
