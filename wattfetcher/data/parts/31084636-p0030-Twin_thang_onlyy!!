Chynah POV
Are you ready to go Siah asked me. Sure I say. He gave the waitress a tip and got the receipt and we left out. Omg its raining I say. Mannn dis some shit right here he says as we start running towards his car. Don't fall and bust your stuff and them red bottom heels he told me smirking. Hahahahaha very funny I said. Once we made it to his car he quickly opened the doors. Look at mi dress I em soaking wet I say mad. Jassiah laughed and said you're not the only one his shirt was also soaking wet. Soaking wet that I cud see through it and see all the tatoos on his chest. I'm not gon lie it was a nice view. Then I noticed he was staring at me, cuz now my dress was see thru due to the rain. I felt a little awkward cuz now he can see the type of bra I have on. My face turned red because I was embarrassed and blushing at the same time. Aw my bad he says looking at me. Its OK I say still embarrassed. I'm not even thinking about that look at mi hare I said. It had gotten into wet waves. He cut on the heat in the car and took off his shirt. Omg the more I looked the more sexier he looked it just turned me on. U see something u like he asked me smirking. Ummm nn-nooo I say stuttering, he laughed. Well I do he says smiling at me, showing those pretty ass dimples. I blushed because I felt my cheeks getting hot. Ummmm thanks I say. Then he leaned over and kisses me. I wrapped my arms around him as he held my waist. We was still parked in the restaurants parking lot. And I felt the sparks through our bodies. We felt each others heart beats its just felt so amazing so rite, u know. Once we pulled away we gazed at each other. Nay I have to tell you something Siah says to me. Yea I say still dazed about wat just happened, with my arms still wrapped around his neck. Nayy I don't know how to put it but I really like u and have mad feelings for you I've been feeling dis way for a while now I just didn't know how to tell u Siah tells me. U have, me too I've been liking u for a while too but I just didn't know how to admit it I say. Aw well dats coo he says showing his dimples u kno dey say thugs can't love, they think of us as hit it and quit it, but Chynah there's something about you you're different from these other gurls I just feel like you're the right one you're smart, pretty,cool like there's so many things about you I can't even explain, so will u be my gurr he asks me.
