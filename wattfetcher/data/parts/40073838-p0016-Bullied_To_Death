Mallory:I was turned around so I looked up to see Ellis. I immediately hugged him, crying. He hugged back and we walked away, leaving River. "It-it was his fault." I cried. "His and Corey's."
"I know, I know." Ellis whispered. I nodded and walked all the way to Ellis' house. "Can I stay the night?" I asked.
"Yeah, sure." He smiled and we walked in. I was then greeted by Ellis' younger brothers, Cole and Jack (Ellis' real brothers). "Hey guys!" I laughed as they tackled me to the floor. I was like their sister. We were all close.
We chased each other up the stairs and went to the loft. I saw that they all grew old of comic books, and now they're into music, Guitar Hero, and karaoke and stuff like that.
I smiled and sat on the drums chair as Ellis and Jack were singing karaoke and Ellis was doing Guitar Hero. I decided to join in. I chose a Green Day song and we played successfully.
I forgot all about Corey, Wil, and River. With my best friends, I can let go and forget. All the pain and suffering, gone. That is until I go home.
Corey:Mallory was gone, probably with her friends. I decided to call up River and Wil to search for her. "Hey Wil." I said into the phone.
"What's up?"
"Let's go get Mallory. Meet me by the park at 10." I smirked and hung up. I called River and he agreed to it.
I got my jacket and ran to the park. It took me about 10 minutes, but I made it. As soon as I got there, I saw River already there. We waited for Wil. His house is the farthest from the park than ours.
"Okay, here's the plan." I said as Wil got here. They nodded. "Wil will knock on the door as River sneaks around the back door, which is always unlocked. I will go with River and distract Ellis' siblings while you guys beat her." I explained and they both looked at each other and nodded.
We broke from our conversation, standing up, and made our way to Ellis' house. Project Takedown Mallory is now in play.
