I woke up to the smell of pancakes and tea. I rolled over and slowly opened my eyes, shielding them from the brightness of the Sun. Johnny stood next to the bed with a tray. On it were the pancakes and tea I had smelt.

"Good morning beautiful." Johnny said. I blushed and sat up.

"Morning. Happy anniversary." I said. Johnny smiled and placed the tray over my legs.

"Happy anniversary." Johnny said and gave me a quick kiss. I smiled and started to eat. Soon I had finished and had helped Johnny with the dishes. We were up in our room again and I had his painting wrapped and sitting on my knee. Johnny was opening his guitar. I bit my lip as he lifted the lid. I watched as Johnny's face lit up. He looked at me wide eyed and I couldn't help but laugh at his expression.

"How did you get this? I couldn't find it anywhere for years! Oh my God, you've out done yourself." Johnny said as he lifted the guitar out of the case. I smiled as I looked at the guitar again. It truly was beautiful (http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/14/18945000/ngbbs49e18e45202b0.jpg) showing off one of our favorite songs, people are strange by the doors. Johnny ran his hand over the body.

"I looked online for it and found a custom shop and had it made." I shrugged. Johnny got up and took my hand. He led me to his music room and instantly found a spot for it. He smiled at me and quickly kissed me. We went back to our room and Johnny handed me a small box.

"Sorry it's nothing as grand as a guitar but I think you'll love it." Johnny said. I unwrapped the box and opened it to reveal a ring with what looks like a snowflake on it (http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/TheBradfordExchangeOnline/01_21179_001_nca?$450$). I smiled when I read the inscription. It read let it go. I smiled at Johnny and put the ring on. I couldn't help myself anymore. I threw my arms around Johnny's neck and held onto him. Johnny laughed and returned my hug.

"Thank you. It's so beautiful." I said. I pulled away and handed him the painting. I bit my lip as he opened it. I watched his face light up as he saw what it was.

"Where did you get this? It's amazing." Johnny said. His eyes met mine and I blushed.

"I actually painted it." I muttered.

"Seriously? It's so cool. It's perfect. Thank you. Everything you've gotten me makes my presents look like nothing." Johnny said. I smiled and shook my head.

"I'm perfectly content with things that don't cost a ton of money." I said. Johnny blushed as he handed me my next gift. "This is kinda embarrassing now after everything you've gotten me." He said. I smiled and opened the box. Inside, I found three shirts. I pulled out the first one and laughed. Johnny remembered my favorite scene from Peter pan and found a shirt with it on it (http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/c0/42/f4/c042f4bde39f02ec589d4fb0cf6267a5.jpg). I smiled as I pulled out the second. Once again it was Peter pan. This time Wendy was trying to kiss him (http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/6f/1e/a8/6f1ea8c32ea6e504291a34791ffcad35.jpg). I blushed when I pulled out the last one. Instead of Peter pan, it was Alice in wonderland. I laughed as I saw the mad hatter and pointed it out to johnny.
