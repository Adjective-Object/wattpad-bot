Tears begin to prick my eyes as I fen for the touch of my little angle.
"I- I- miss her." I choke out trying not too cry.
Christiana stopped all Movement with trying to get me up and sat on the edge of my bed watching me as I fall apart in front of her.My body shifts ae she quickly pulls me into a tight hug.
"I know baby. I know it's hard but I have faith she'll come back." She tells me as I cry into her arms.I haven't cried since I've said goodbye to Ema. I've just been numb.
"W- w- what if she d- doesn't ." I choke out. I hear Christiana sigh but doesn't say anything. She doesn't know this feeling.
"She's my only reason for living!" I cry harder into her arms. She really is my only reason for living. Without her, there's basically no reason.
"why would he do such a thing to me?" I yell tightening the hug a bit.
She pulled away and stared into my weak eyes that have no life inside if them.
"We're going out tonight. We're going to get you drunk and were going to make you feel somewhat better okay? I can't stand to see my best fiend like this. It hurts my heart."
I nod my head slowly as she walks away to my bathroom. Maybe going out and getting completely wasted isn't such a bad idea.
I hear the water turn on and Christiana exits the bathroom. "Now before we do anything, shower. Because you stink like hell since you haven't showered in basically two weeks."
(Harry's POV)
I run into the kitchen to grab Emas bottle of milk out the fridge. "Please Ema ... Stop crying for daddy. Please." I take her from Nialls arms to feed her. But she keeps jerking her head away from the bottle.
"What's wrong with her?!" I yell at the boys who are trying there best to help.
"We don't know Harry, we've tried everything. Feeding her, changing her diaper, pacifier, berping her, playing with her, putting her too sleep but none of it seems to work!" Niall says as I move her up in down to try to calm her.
She hasn't talk at all since she got here. I would have to force her too eat and sleep. I just don't know what's wrong with her.
"Please ema! Tell daddy what's wrong. I'm begging you." I plead to my daughter. I never learned how to deal with a baby who keeps crying non stop. "Do you think she's sick or something?" Niall adds getting fidgety from all the crying.
"wahhhh!!!" She cried loudly once again.
"Please ema, tell daddy's what's wrong. I need to know how I can help you!" I was on the verge of tears. It's a sick feeling when your child is crying and all you want to do is help them but you can't. It hurts so much.
I walk into the bedroom where me and Ema are alone. I lay on the bed and lay her on my stomach where she faces me.
"Please Ema. I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you want or need and I'll give it too you! Please Ema I love you so much and it hurts me too see you cry. Just tell me. Please."
I watch as her tears calm down as her beautiful eyes lock onto mine. "mama." She whispers enough for me to hear.
I was dreading she would ever say that but she did. "What did you say Ema?" I move closer to her in attempt to make sure I didn't hear what I just did.
"Mama. I want mama."
