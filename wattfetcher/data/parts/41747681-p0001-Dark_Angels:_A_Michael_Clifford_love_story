Lacey Williams was abandoned by her family two days after her tenth birthday. After wandering the small continent of Australia for three years, she meets a shy, fourteen year old, only child named Michael. After listening to Lacey's shocking story, Michael convinces his parents to take Lacey in, and soon the pair become best friends. Until Michael gets his big break...

Michael Clifford and his three best friends Luke, Calum, and Ashton get their chance to prove to the world just how great of a band they really are when One Direction asks them to be their opening act. The only problem is, 5 Seconds of Summer won't be performing in Australia. They'll be in the United States.

Lacey is torn. Michael was the boy who found her and saved her life. She's angry, hurt, and feels completely betrayed. So what does she do? She runs and never looks back.

Now, at age 18 Lacey has been taken in by a group of women delinquents that have been disowned by their own families. Lacey is finally being accepted once again, but she will never be the same girl she was a few years ago. And more importantly, she'll never believe in love. Why? Because the only person she truly loved, left.
