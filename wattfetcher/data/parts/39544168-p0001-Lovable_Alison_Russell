Alison Russell had always loved the beautiful London with its amazing buildings. It was a place where she felt happy.
She was a lovable, brave, artist with blonde hair and green-ish eyes. Her friends saw her as a happy, green animal lover. Once, she had even helped a shivering kitten cross the road. That's the sort of woman she was.
Alison walked over to the window and reflected on her pretty surroundings. The clouds danced like loving puppies.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Chloe Johnson. Chloe was a giving writer with brunette hair and dark brown eyes.
Alison gulped. She was not prepared for Chloe.
As Alison stepped outside and Chloe came closer, she could see the testy glint in her eye.
Chloe gazed with the affection of 2201 charming heavy hamsters. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you..."           Alison looked back, even more happy. "Chloe..." she replied, smiling and not knowing how to respond.
They looked at each other with sparkly feelings, like two creepy, crowded cats dancing at a very wild Valentine's meal.
Alison regarded Chloe's beautiful, dark brown eyes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Alison with a delighted grin.
Chloe looked active, her emotions blushing like a brainy, good book.
Then Chloe came inside for a nice mug of cocoa and to talk about their feelings for each other.
