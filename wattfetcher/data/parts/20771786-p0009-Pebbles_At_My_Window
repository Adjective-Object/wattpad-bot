Did Marcus just say "wanna kiss?"
"Excuse me?" my voice squeaked.
He held out his hand in a fist and I was afraid that it would be a bomb to kill everyone. Or a knife to slit my throat. I watch too many movies, I know.
"Want a kiss?" he says again which makes me shudder. He opens his fist and there sits about 10... Hershey kisses?
What the hell?
"Yes," my voice squeaks again.
He smirks at my voice change. I carefully take 2 afraid that it might be a trap. He watches my every move too which makes me sweat and redden rapidly.
"Wanna meet that guy?" I change the subject before it gets awkward.
"No, we'll meet him sooner or later. I want to stay with you." He says not taking his eyes off the big movie screen.
Did that sex scene make him get all mushy? What is happening to my movie life? This isn't in the script! Script rewrite!
