Franny and Gabby was fighting over the bathroom mirror. Danni was on her bed rubbing her temples. She was dressed and ready. Gabby was her ride.
"Aye want a ride?" I ask Danni.
She smiles and gets up. "Thanks."
"No problem."
I drop her off at school and go to my school. It wasnt far. I park in MY parking spot. Front and center. I hop out. My nigga James runs up to me.
"Aye." He says giving me dap.
"Wassup." I say looking around.
I fucked half the girls at this school.
"There's this new girl." James says. "She is bad as fuck."
"Sure." I say not believing him. "I bet I can fuck her by next week. Every girl got a little rachet in them."
"Bet then. 20 bucks." He says putting his hand out.
I shake it. "Now where this hoe at?"
He points in the direction. Dayum. She was brown skinned thick and pretty. She look like she got an attitude already but all she need is a tamer.
I walk up to her as she talks to these girls that I've fucked before.
"Hey beautiful." I say biting my lip.
She rolls her eyes. "The fuck you want hoe?"
"Hoe?" I ask laughing. "Im the hoe?"
"Yes." She says with a straight face. "You look and act like a hoe. Im just bein real witchu boy."
"Its all good ma." I say.
This bitch gone get fucked up by me.
"My name aint ma. Nigga its Laurie." She says.
"My names EJ." I say taking her hand.
I step closer.
"Maybe we can.. talk a little more later. If you catch my drift."
She starts laughing.
"What's funny?" I ask confused.
That usually works.
"You think I'm like that?" She asks with a straight face. "Well let me tell you some playboy. I am not a hoe. I dont fuck niggas who whisper 'sexy things' in my ear. You aint even cute my nigga. So if you would bag back and give me some space, we might become friends. But you need to respect me and yourself."
She looks at me one more time and walks away. My mouth hangs open. Damn shawty had a mouth on her. She short too which makes it sexy.
"Nigga." James says laughing. "She put yo ass in check."
"Its all a front." I say. "She aint for real. She tryna play hard to get."
"Sure." He says laughing. "But she from Cali so she aint playin games. But you'll get a girl at the part I'm throwing tonight."
"Alright but, Damn. A Cali girl. They hard but I can get her." I say grinning.
I cant get her. Cali girls are too hard. They carry they selves so high above people they barely see you. I might of met my match.***********
