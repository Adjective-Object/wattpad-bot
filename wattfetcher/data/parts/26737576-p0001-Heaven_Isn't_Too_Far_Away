My life three years ago was nothing short of interesting. I'd been just a freshman at St. Louis University, living with my aunt and my younger brother in Monroe County, Illinois. I had a whole future ahead of me. I was studying to be a cardiologist to help people with heart defects and cardiac issues. My mom had died from a heart defect when I was just five. Needless to say, it scarred me for life. But I moved on just like everyone eventually does.
Then I met a girl. Now, meeting a girl and making her my girlfriend was actually the last thing on my list three years ago. I had absolutely no desire to be serious in a relationship. At least, I'd planned that up until I'd met Reagan Kelly. As infuriating as she is, I love her to death. Unfortunately, we'd found out that we were expecting a baby towards the end of our freshman year. Something neither of us ever planned on, but it happened.
Reagan and I stuck with school while Thomas babysat whenever he could. Everyone got their share of babysitting which really helped out Reagan and me. I'd gotten another job in addition to working at Schnucks. Reagan offered to get another job, but I decided against it. I made her a promise that I would take care of her and I did. Granted, I lost a lot of sleep, but it was worth it.
Now three years later, Reagan is a Clinical Psychologist in the city--which is a nice twenty minutes from Reagan's condo-- and I'm a Cardiologist in training. The scholarships and grants that we both had applied for seemed to really help because neither of us were in any debt for school. Somehow, we'd managed to have jobs, a baby, and graduate college. The odds were definitely in our favor and I was glad they were.
But sometimes I still think about what could've been had I not gotten Reagan pregnant. Don't get me wrong, I love Heaven more than my own life, but still. Maybe I could've gotten more sleep and actually been able to live my life with friends. I'll always love Reagan in the end, but there are days when it gets extremely hard to keep going. Some days you just want to pack a bag and never look back. Especially on the days when you have an argument. Those are the worst. It's even more frustrating when you're married to a woman that never gives up in an argument. But aside from arguing and all of that, I'm happy with the way my life turned out. I'd do anything for Heaven and Reagan and she'd do anything for me. Just the way I want it.
