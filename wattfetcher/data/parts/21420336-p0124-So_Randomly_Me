I have been reading the fairy tail manga and
asdfghjkl
Im in 300 chapter I think
Im doing an essay for hw rn
after that I do a summary
than 5 questions
fml its 10 pm
XD
someone drew a napkin to represent me when I didnt go to school and on it they wrote
"Nico, MCR, Gay Pride"
That is literally me in a nutshell
and someone was going to throw it away in the trash
and when I heard that I told my friend he shouldve said
"NO DONT YOU KNOW SANDY HATES BEING WITH HER KIND"
I basically called myself garbage
Thats okay though because I found it funny B)
OH MY GODS
I HAVE THIS IDEA
SO AU WHERE A DAUGHTER OF NEMISIS IS FIGHTING A MONSTER RIGHT
AND SHE ENDS UP UNCONCIOUS
AND LIKE PERCY AND THE SEVEN FIND HER SO THEY JUST BRING HER ON THE SHIP
AND EVERYONE IS LIKE "WUT ARE YOU DOING"
AND SHES LIKE "NONE OF YOUR BEESWAX" AND SHES LIKE 14 AND SHE BECOMES BEST FRIENDS WITH HAZEL BECAUSE LIKE HAZEL IS SO SWEET AND SHE UNDERSTANDS HER
AND LIKE THEN SHE MEETS NICO AND THEY HAVE THIS MUTUAL AGREEMENT TO NOT BOTHER EACH OTHER
AND THEY LIKE MEET UP A LOT TO JUST LOOK AT THE SKY
BUT NO NO NO NEITHER OF THEM ACTUALLY LIKE EACH OTHER THAT WAY
WANNA KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THE DAUGHTER OF NEMISIS IS LESBIAN
AND NICOS GAY
SO THEN WHEN SHE COMES OUT TO HIM THEY SHARE STORIES ABOUT HOW FUNNY IT WAS WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE STRAIGHT
AND LIKE PERCY FEELS REALLY BAD BECAUSE OF ETHAN NAKUMURA BECAUSE ETHAN AND HER WERE STEP SIBLINGS SO DOES HE THINK BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY FULL SIBLINGS
AND SHE DIES AT THE END
PROTECTING ONE OF THE SEVEN BECAUSE SHE NEVER HAD MANY FRIENDS SINCE ETHAN HAD TOLD HER THAT THEY DIDNT HAVE A PLACE FOR HER AT CHB
AND SHE DIDNT KNOW UNTIL NOW
THOUGHTS??
