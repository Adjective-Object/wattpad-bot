Riri's P.O.V"RIRI WAKE UP PRINCESS ITS TIME FOR SCHOOL!" Yelled my mom.
"Alright I'm up!"
Another day being me and people wonder why I don't smoke drugs it's because my life makes me high enough!
I showered and then ran downstairs because I was trying to be fashionably late not extremely late.
"Hey Baby, how are you?" Said my mom.
"I'm good I guess wished I could of slept a couple of more minutes though!"
"Now Riri you know you have your exams today?"
"Yeah whatever! I said, trying to finish my breakfast."
"Okay I'm gone!"
"Bye!" My mom said.
As I'm in my 2015 Mercedes Benz, I adjust my mirrors, but only to get a better view of myself. I'm 16 so technically I'm not supposed to be driving without an adult but who cares! I mean as long as I don't get caught, which I never do, then I'm good!
I pulled up to my school RidgeWood High and threw on my stunner shades as usual. I see my bff and bf together their friends so it's not weird.
"Heyy Tracie!" Hey Brian!" I say as I get out of my car.
"Heyy Riri!" Tracie says."Heyyy Booo!!" Brian says
I sped walk to catch up with them.
"Omg guys our exams are today, can you believe it?"
"Ugh don't remind me!" Tracie said
"Well unlike you girls I have a game plan." Brian said.
"Ohh really what is it?"
"You know that dork Miranda." Brian said.
"Yeah why?"
"She's your ticket to passing the exams?" Tracie asked.
"Yupp she sure is! I think I'll use the I've always loved you line!" Brian said
"Lmao I won't be the least bit jealous!"
"Babe you don't have any reason to be! Like have you seen her?" Brian said
"Yeah the girl needs a makeover desperately!" Tracie agreed.
"I almost fell to the floor laughing at my two favorite people!"
