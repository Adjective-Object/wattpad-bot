Life is too short for me to live a lie.
So I stop holding myself back
Wondering how stupid I must look.
I'm sure I do look stupid
But I am me.
And I honestly don't give a shit what you have to say.
I am breaking the chains holding me in place;
I am running wild and free
And most importantly me
Through the galaxy.
I am not living a lie.
Not anymore- at least.
Change is good.
