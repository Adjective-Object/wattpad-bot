"It's alright Louis." Louis didn't listen he just kept crying.
Liam went down on his knees to be eye level or close to eye level with Louis. "Hey, Louis. Look at me, Niall is fine. Do you want to here the story of what Niall went through at the hospital." Louis nodded. "Niall had to have surgery on his leg yesterday. He broke his leg in for different places. His ankle, part of his thigh bone, and Tibia and Fibula. He also dislocated his knee and tore some ligaments. But, Louis the best part of it was when he woke up right before the Orange part of his cast went on. He was a laughing ball of Niall. And he is going to be alright." Right then and there Niall started to cry because he wanted someone to come and see him. "But, he will be alright. Now go and see Ni, while we go talk to Haz."

"Alright." Then they walked to Harry's room.

"Hey Haz. Louis told us what happened yesterday with Niall and how to took the toy that he was playing with."

"Yeah."

"Now you know that was wrong didn't you?" Harry nodded. "Now go and apologize to Ni. Then sit in the time out chair." After Zayn and Liam talked to Harry they went down stairs to make breakfast. Zayn went to cook. Liam went to take Niall form Louis. But, Louis wouldn't let him. So, Liam just gave up trying to Niall from Louis, and just decided to let Louis carry him downstairs.
"Hey, Lou. What are you doing?"

"Nothing."

But before Liam could say some thing zayn called from the kitchen "Guys come eat."
"Coming" Liam shouted back. Then they went to eat.

10 months later

"Louis, Harry, lets go to!" Zayn shouted to his two other kids.

"Coming Papa." Harry and Louis called in unison.

When they got to the hospital they waited in the waiting room for about 20 minutes.

"Niall Horan?"

"Yes, Lets go boys." Half an our later the Payne-Malik family were on their way home. With baby Niall in Zayn's arms. They would perfectly fine. Even Niall.
