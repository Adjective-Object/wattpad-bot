I'm not going to school tomorrow because today was just too much for me.
I asked my mom if I could stay home and she said I could.
I didn't tell her anything about.....yeah. So.... I might not be on much this week. Yeah....
I'm closing my text so don't try and text me anyone.Or inbox me. just one certain person I'll be talking to because she means a lot to me and I know she's going to need me this week.You know who you are.
