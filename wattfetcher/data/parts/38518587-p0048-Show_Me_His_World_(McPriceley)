"Nobody is too busy for some ice skating before Christmas!" Connor exclaimed, grabbing Kevin's hands and yanking him forward.
After they'd had their fill of the rink, they returned their skates as the sun began to set.
"Want to get dinner?" Kevin asked.
"Sure, where?"
"Let's go to Tavern on the Green."
"Kevin no, I can't afford that and I'm not letting you pay for me to eat there."
"You got me a drink earlier by performing in front of fifty people, now it's my turn to show my talent, buying expensive things."
Connor begrudgingly agreed, secretly excited to be eating at the classy restaurant. They walked into Central Park and proceeded to the restaurant that was located in Central Park West.
Never in his life had Connor eaten such amazing food, it was truly worth every penny.
After dinner, Kevin walked Connor to his apartment and said goodbye at the door. "Don't forget to bring me my gloves tomorrow." He reminded him. Connor nodded and patted Kevin's arm awkwardly. "I had fun today, thanks for hanging out with me. I really needed it."
"No problem, Con." Kevin said before turning around and walking away.
Connor watched him go, then watched the spot where Kevin had been, long after he had left. A few minutes later he walked into his apartment and closed the door.
As he slipped off Kevin's gloves, Connor felt a fluttering sort of feeling in his chest that comforted and warmed him. He put the gloves on the counter and walked into his little bathroom.
Watching himself in the mirror, Connor pulled off the sweater and frowned at his reflection. It was much worse than he had thought.
