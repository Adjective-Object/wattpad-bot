Dedicated to chloe158EmmaIsSavior : Henry, Regina and I have something very important to ask you.
TruestBeliever : Yes?
YourMajesty : Who's your favorite Mom?
TruestBeliever : I love you both equally.
EmmaIsSaviour : But if you had to choose...
TruestBeliever : Idk
YourMajesty : I raised you!
EmmaIsSavior : I gave birth to you!
YourMajesty : Yeah in Prison...
EmmaIsSaviour : Shut up Regina
YourMajesty : Never!
EmmaIsSavior : She's the evil queen!
YourMajesty : Was! And she IS the dark one!
EmmaIsSaviour : Only because I saved you from the darkness!
YourMajesty: Well Henry I saved you from getting stabbed!
EmmaIsSavior : I saved you after Regina poisoned you!
YourMajesty: It was meant for you!
EmmaIsSavior : THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER!
YourMajesty: URG so Henry?????
TruestBeliever : I don't have a favorite mom!
EmmaIsSavior : What if Regina and I were both hanging off a cliff and you could only save one of us. Who would you save?
TruestBeliever : I would save Emma because Regina is better at magic.
EmmaIsSaviour : HA in yo face! Wait what?!?
YourMajesty : Our child speaks the truth!
EmmaIsSavior : Does not!
YourMajesty : Puhlease, I taught you everything you know.
EmmaIsSaviour : Whatever.

EmmaIsSavior : Fine. I'll stop when she stops
YourMajesty: I'll stop when she stops!
