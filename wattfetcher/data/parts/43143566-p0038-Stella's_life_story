welp,school is over now...i have like 19 storys posted on wattpad?idk, all i know is that im so happy that people are actually reading the stuff that i right.
i was actually starting to feel like writing was just some hobbie that was for nothing since nobody like me for being the book worm that i am.im really happy that i have a lot of reads, even if it IS just 100 or something.
i want to reach 1k but i know that is just some far away day dream hope.who knows..maybe..maybe I could reach that...
