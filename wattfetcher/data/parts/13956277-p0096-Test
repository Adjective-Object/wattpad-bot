"Stay 9 feet away from me so they don't think we came together, Okay?" I said through the loud music in the park, "Why don't I go home instead ? It's a better Idea" He mocked and I laughed out loud, "OK, 4 feet then?" I smiled, "Fine",then my eyes layed down on the roller coaster, "Let's get in this" I sounded so childish yet excited, I didn't mind the fact that he sat beside me, we were having fun, I was actually having fun for the first time in ages...
"You ready ? Don't scream in my ears or while your nose with my shirt when it slides down" Simon warned me as the roller coaster started moving and I giggled, "Don't use my hijab to stop your mouth from screaming and don't wipe your eyes with it" We reached the top then it slid down in speed of light, we both were screaming, I turned my face toward his and screamed in his ear in happiness as he screamed louder while laughing.
"Buy me popcorn" I demanded, "Buy yourself popcorn, you got money" He said as he took a sip from his Pepsi, "Hey! You got me here so you gotta feed me before I eat your perfect silky hair because I'm a girl with a huge appetite" I threatened, "OKAY ! Just stay away from the gorgeous  hair" He said as he went to get me what I wanted, "EXTRA LARGE PLEASE" I shouted, Simon sighed in disappointment, but he brought it tho!
"Want to play this?" I pointed at the game where you use a gun to shoot bottles to win stuffed bears, "I don't play easy things" He removed the imaginary dust over his shoulder, "I'll play for the tickets  It's a challenge Mr.Handsome" I raised an eyebrow, "It's on then, Ms.Hot" He winked as he took the pulled the gun. Simon hit 4 bottles, "You can't beat that" He said in a challenging tone, "Seriously? Man! I'm Arab !" I grinned then snpped the gun from him, "Oh, Oh no ! Show me what you got you Arab chick" He chuckled, "Back off" 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 I shot all the bottles on the shelf and left the man that runs the place with his mouth wide open, I looked at Simon with a huge smile on my face while his was in complete shock, "Hi how do why b-" He couldn't say a complete sentence, I watched him trying to untie is tongue, "My uncle taught me when I was 6, weird right? I mean, who lets a little girl hold a gun" I laughed, "Here's your prize" The man gave me the biggest bear he had, his face said he was still in shock tho.
"I let you win because I hate watching babies crying" Simon said as we were walking and eating candy, "Oh seriously? Stop lying, I know, you know, and that poor scared man knows that I'm professional and nailed it while your hands were shaking" I laughed.
We continued talking and walking around while laughing, I couldn't ever imagine that someday I'd stay out late with a guy friend in a park ... A hot guy friend who keeps me safe and defends me and does all he can just to make me happy, and who's non - Muslim also. It was not 100% correct the thing I was doing, but the thing for sure was that Simon gained himself  some chapters in my life. That's why I was happy  but feeling guilty.
