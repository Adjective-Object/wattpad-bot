Chapter 9
Shea's P.O.V
I layed there in my bed thinking about what happened with me and Seth over the weekend. He called me a slut. How could he do that? I pondered the thought of actually going through with giving Casper a chance. He didn't call me a slut...
"Shea?" I heared Seths voice through the door.
"What?" I said in a crule tone.
"Its time to go to school lets go" He said back with no emotion.
I looked at myself one last time in the mirror. I was satisfied. I looked cute. I grabbed my bag and books and walked out into the hallway.
I reached the kitchen and stopped dead in my tracks when I saw Seth. Gosh I almost forgot how freaking sexy he- No Shea hes and asshole.
"She-"
"Shut up Seth, lets just go" I continued to walk out the door, I felt Seth grab ahold of my hand and I stopped.
"Shea please Im sorry" I wripped my hand away from the warmth of his and continued to walk. I made m way to the car and got in the passenger side slamming the door behind me.
Seth followed the saddest pain on his face. He started the car and drove us to school. Not one word said no sound made.
~IN SCHOOL~
I walked down the hallway trying to find this stupid classroom. I kept walking when my phone buzzed. I started walking and searching for my phone. I finally found it when I bummped into a hard chest.
"Woah why don't you watch-" I looked up seeing Casper face looking down at me with a frown. "Casper" I said in a whisper.
"Why don't you watch were your going" He said then started walking away.
"Casper wait!" I said chasing after him.
"What" He said angrily and stopping.
"I want to give you a chance" I said. He turned around and looked at me confused.
"What?" He asked with a confused look and walking towards me.
"I want to try us" I said in a quiet voice and looking down at the ground.
I felt his finger go under my chin and lift my eyes to meet his.
"You really want to?" He asked looking into my eyes.
I bite my lip and looked into his beautiful eyes. "Yes" I said simply. A smile formed on his lips and he slowly closed his eyes and leaned in kissing me softly. I didn't close my eyes because I didn't feel anything but I wanted this to be believeable. So I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him back. Stupid I know.
He pulled away and rested his forehead against mine and gave me an eskimo kiss... Just like Seth used too... Tears started forming in my eyes. I missed him, but he hurt me. This is payback. If he wants to call me a slut. I'll show him one.
I looked up seeing Seth staring at me and Casper. A tear fell down his cheek. This is what he gets.
But Shea remember what he told you It kills him when he sees you in Caspers arms
I don't care he deserves this after what he did.
