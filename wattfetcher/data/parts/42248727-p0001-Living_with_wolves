Renee Sanders meets the guys that would live with her for the next few months and her life just gets interesting. But what would really blow her mind away is when she finds out the boys' deepest secret by accident. As the months pass and days count, new friendship, promises, and maybe even love begins to approach in Renee's life and that's all that would matter. But what if not only these boys in her life are dangerously charming, but could also bring trouble.

This book and characters all came from my own imagination. Haters back off (Miranda's voice). Those who are here to check this book out, thank you for taking your time to click on this story and read my rant. Oh and this idea literally came to me a few years ago and it's only now that I had the guts to share it in public. Also, there would be some unedited chapters and mistakes so just bare with it until I have the time to edit.
