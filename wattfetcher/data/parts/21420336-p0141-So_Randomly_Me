NO I Need AMERICA TO CALL ENGLAND BIG BROTHER

ACCIDENTALLY
AND THEN THEY WILL JUST GET REALLY AWKWARDLY SILENT

AND AMERICA EXCUSES HIMSELF FROM THE ROOM AS ENGLAND SADLY LOOKS AT HIM

BECAUSE THE BOND THEY HAD CREATED BEFORE AMERICA CHOSE TO BE INDEPENDENT IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT JUST VANISH

AND I NEED AMERICA TO TREAT JAPAN LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER BECUASE JAPAN IS SO RESERVED AND SHY AND AMERICA IS SO LOUD AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL

AND RUSSIA IS SO ADORABLEEEEEE
