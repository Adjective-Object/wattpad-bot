"I don't think you bought me a scroll or paper when we went to the market yesterday," Lethe said, trying to remember her day at the market. Gosh, it seemed so blurry now.

"Just  little farther," Theo told Alodia, who seemed quite impatient to get to the town already. "I say some signs that said that we were just a bit far from town. It should come into our view any minute right..."
A stone gate could be seen in the distance.
"Now."
"Wow," Lethe couldn't help but remark. "You are very good at timing your words and knowing when these events will happen, don't you?"
