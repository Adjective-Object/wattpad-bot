"It looks amazing! It totally suits you!"
" Oh my god, Channy! Shut up and dance with me!"
He gets a hold of my arm and drags me towards the dance floor, where we dance like complete lunatics, although we were both really good at dancing. Gabby delicately hold my finger and spins me around as if we are doing a freestyle disco dance. Gabby slowly leans in to my ears to whisper something,
"Chantel, let's have a party. We'll invite your pants to come down." He whispers in his signature seductive voice. My eyes widen, putting my index finger on his chest and push him back a bit, making him chuckle that's knees-falling worthy.
" You really need to work on your pick up lines. Just like 3 years ago, your still no good."
" Oh, I've missed you so much, Channy!" Gabe embraces me into a another hug.
I squeeze my eyes shut, rest my head on his shoulders and wrapped my arms around his torso, swaying completely out of tune with the music. As I opened them, my gaze fall on someone I haven't expected to see at an event like this. Our gaze locked and I could see a spark in his green eye which all changes as it gets devoured by envy and discomfort.
