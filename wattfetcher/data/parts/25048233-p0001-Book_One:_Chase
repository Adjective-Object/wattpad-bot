CHAPTER ONE: THE TRUTH

“Kyaaa! That’s Chase! He’s super cool! OMG, I need to take a picture of him before the class starts!”
“Chase! Look here, Chase!”
“OMG, it’s Chase!”
“He looked at me! Chase looked at me!”
Several girls were gathered around Archcross High School’s main gate while shouting my name. It seemed as if they were waiting for me to arrive. I know I’m handsome and all but I never thought I’d be this popular. I mean, I don’t only have the looks and the brains but I’m also pretty much gifted down there. Heh heh.
Middle School was a pain for me. Being the top of the class did not really give me immunity to the bullies that invaded the school I am in. It’s not their fault though - I never really cared about how I looked back then. I prioritized studying which is why I forgot to take care of my poor self. At least, I learned that a balance between the looks and the brains is needed to live a successful student life.
Enough reminiscing the past! It’s time to move forward and drown in the compliments I’m receiving from these girls. This is the life I’ve always wanted to live!
I was about to receive one of the girls’ gifts when their tone suddenly shifted. I’m not hearing “Chase” anymore - it has been replaced with “Ice”. Damn you Ice! Why’d you have to show up today? Can’t I savor my popularity first before you steal the spotlight away from me?
“Kyaaa! Ice! Number One!”
Geez. You need not slap that to my face. Sigh. Yes, it’s true. I’m Number Two when it comes to studies. I just can’t seem to beat him no matter how hard I try. There’s one thing that keeps bugging me though – I don’t understand how these girls seem to be drooling over him when I have the better looks. The only thing outstanding that I see in him is the overly-sized glasses he is sporting. To be honest, it makes him really nerdy. It also doesn’t seem to hide his sad eyes even if he tries his best to cover it. Why is he sad anyway? He is the most popular person in the campus! He should be proud of it!
He looks my way and sees me staring at him. He gives me this faintest smile that even a normal person won’t see. Why the fuck is this guy smiling at me? It’s not like I’m checking him out or something. I’m not freaking gay!

==========================================================
“Hey Chase! Chase! Wait up!”
I was on my way to class when I heard a familiar voice calling me. I knew it! I need to run away from this annoying girl. I’m not gonna’ allow her to touch me ever again – over my dead body. I’m talking about the school’s Newspaper Club president, Pearl. The last time I met her left me wounded and bleeding. Well, that was kinda’ exaggerated but still it was a pretty bad experience for me!
“Damn you Chase! You haven’t seen the last of me!”
Let me tell you the vivid memories I’ve had the last time I talked to her. It was Lunch time when this girl suddenly grabbed my hand and dragged me to this seemingly abandoned room. She handcuffed me to one of these dusty chairs and forced me to sit on it. She closed the door and locked it. I wasn’t able to do anything as I was too shocked on what was happening. What the fuck? Who is this motherfucking psycho? No one fucking dares to mess with my clothes! Yes, I cuss a lot. Sorry.
“Who the fuck are you? Miss Psycho?!” I managed to shout at her despite the dust that has covered the air. Damn, it’s making it hard for me to breathe. *Cough cough*
