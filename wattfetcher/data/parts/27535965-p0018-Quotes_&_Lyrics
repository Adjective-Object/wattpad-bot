"...and I want you all to remember -- that you must not dream yourselves back to the times before the war, but dream for you all, young and old, must be to create an ideal of human decency, not a narrow-minded and prejudiced one. That is the great gift our country hungers for, something every little peasant boy can look forward to, and with pleasure feel he is a part of -- something he can work and fight for."
~Kim Malthe-Bruun | via. a letter to his mother a day before his execution.
Day of death: April 6, 1945 (21 years old)
I love this quote so much. I found it while reading Number The Stars by Lois Lowry just less than an hour ago. I was so mesmerized by it, that I had to share it with you guys.
BY THE WAY, picture above IS Kim.
