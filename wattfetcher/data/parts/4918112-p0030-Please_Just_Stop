But no. This was a WHOLE different environment.
Two weeks in, I find my first bully. It happened by accident. She was picking on a friend, so I stood up for them. And then she turned on me. She kept bugging me. When no one wanted to sit with me, she and her lackies would come up and tell me how ugly and stupid and worthless I was. How much of a loser and a freak I was. I tried councillors. I tried talking to the principal. It didn't work. And being entirely new to society, I had no clue how to stand up for myself. I couldn't just tell myself that she was wrong, because I hadn't (and still have not) learned to not let words affect me. There was one time she pushed a kid in the hall and I was afraid that I was going to be next.
She moved to another school after that year. But then a friend told me that she would be coming back for high school. You wouldn't believe how terrified I was. I still haven't seen her, though, and hope I never have to.
To this day, I still believe everything she ever told me... She really fucked me up. Even my thoughts echo those fucking mantras she instilled in me. And everyone else has taken her place, even if I haven't seen her yet. It's because of her that I'm the way I am, but that's another story for another day, and only for people who want to hear it.
There's another girl I know, *name withheld*, who had people worse than this. She had an old Wattpad account that she had to remove, as well as several blogs meant to vent, because they forced her to. And they.... they just did a lot to her. But if you're reading this, I love you girlie :)
But yeah... What about you guys?
