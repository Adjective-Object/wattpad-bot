As soon as I walked in the garage Chase was climbing out of his car. "Hey mom, looks like second round of practice is cancelled.""Yes, but at four is the Sprint Cup practice. So they'll probably postpone that until the track is dry""So do it think they'll postpone XFinity practice until four-ish or just cancel it?""Probably just cancel it" Another voice said, Chase and I turned and looked to see Taylor standing in the garage soaking wet. "Sweetheart, we got to get you a towel!" I said as I walked over to where the crew had stuff set up and grabbed a clean and folded blue towel with the NAPA logo embroidered on one of the ends - actually it was quite fancy for a towel to dry of things in the garage. But every week we get new ones.
