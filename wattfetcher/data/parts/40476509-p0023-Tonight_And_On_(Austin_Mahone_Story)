"Can you point me to where the room is at?" I asked. "Yes. You go straight down, make a left, then make a right, and it'll be the last door on your right" he answered. "Ok thank you" I said and walked away. I walked to her room and once I got there I walked in and left the door open. I saw a chair in the corner, so I sat and waited.
Amanda's P.O.V.
I sat in the operating room for over 3 hours and I did't want to sit there anymore. I saw a doctor walk to the door and opened it. He walked in and then I walked out. I made my way to the front desk and then I saw Riya and the girls. They were all crying which made me cry. I walked over to Quadira since she was walking to the front desk. "Excuse me, can you tell me where room #345 is at, we're here for Amanda Quevedo" Quadira said to the man at the front desk.
"Of course, you go straight down, make a left, then make a right, and it'll be the last door on your right" he answered. "Ok thank you" she replied and walked away. "Come on, let's go" Quadira said to the girls. She lead the way to my room and I followed until I saw the doctors taking my body to my room. They all stood aside to let them bring me in. One doctor stood behind talking to Austin while the rest of them left.
"How is she doctor?" He asked concerned. "She is in a coma, she may be able to wake up but its a 50-50% chance that she will make it" he answered. Everyone started to cry and I even cried. I just thought to myself, "this is a life or death situation". It made me very even more.
