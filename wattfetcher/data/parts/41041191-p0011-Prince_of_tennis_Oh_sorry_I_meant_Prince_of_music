Atobe was mad until Oshitari came up to him and told him to calm down, which Atobe did.

"Well ignore that, Let me explain the rules to you  Since I am pretty sure you do not know"Said Atobe.

"Who said that. I know the rules."Said Ryuu smirking."Well I am going to tell them"Said Atobe clearly really pissed with the freshmen.
