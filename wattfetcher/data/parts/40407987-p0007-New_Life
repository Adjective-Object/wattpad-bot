"Someone who doesn't have the time to deal with your shit," I heard Blaine snicker behind me, and I feel happy with my comeback. "Well I'm going to go now," I turn towards the rest of the Warblers, and smile. "That was a great performance, boys." I turn toward Blaine this time, and see he is trying to hide a smile. "I'll see you at school tomorrow," he hugs me and I get up to leave.
"Bye smartie pants!" Blaine yells, and I shake my head laughing at him before waving behind me. I walk out of the room with a shake of my hips, and down the hall.
