I turn back to a fuming Joshua. "What the hell!" He exclaims before walking towards the house and attempting to walk inside. "Do you mind opening the door?" He says angrily while I run over and mess with the key in my pocket.
"Um, can you try to towel off a bit? Mom would kill me if we tracked paint in the house." I explain. He rolls his eyes and walks in anyway. Rude.
"What do you think you think you're doing?" I call from outside because I'm still dirty.
"What does it look like? I'm going to Narnia." He says sarcastically.
"Hey! This is my house, and you better repect that." I state furiously.
"And If I don't, what happens?"
I smile devilishly. "If you don't, you're going to have a little talk with my mom."
He studies me curiously. As if he hasn't known me my whole life and is just realizing I exist now.  "Well we wouldn't want that now would we." he finally says before walking outside over to a hose. I watch in awe as his muscle bulge when he bends down to pick it up.
"I'm way to hot. If you keep staring, your eyes will burn up." He says handing me the hose. "Mind rinsing me off?" he smirks.
"Of course." I smile, going along with his game. He gives me a look that would usally make any girls heart stop but only makes my blood boil. Why is he so arrogant? I drop my fake smile and glare. "Of course I mind." I say before pressure washing his toes.
"What the f*ck! Stop!" He screams. I figure thats enough and grant him his wish. "What's your problem?"
"You tracked paint on the floors! I'm not cleaning that up!"
"I'll clean it! Gawd." he says before Kyle takes the hose from me and rinses off Joshua.
When Joshua walks inside, everyone burst out laughing.
"That was beast! I'm sick of Joshua getting all the girls. Your mine." He says excitedly.
"I'm what?" I ask arching an eyebrow.
He seems to notice what he let slip out of his mouth. "Uh-Your my friends sister. I said that."
"Sure you did. Can I sleep over? It's getting dark and I don't feel like driving." Payton ask.
"Yeah we can have a girls night!"
"Yes! Mind hoseing me off?"
"No problem."
After everyone is hosed off, we take showers and meet up in the living room to watch movies.
"Lets watch scary movies!" Quintin says.
"Yeah! The Conjuring!" Kyle shouts.
"No!" Payton shouts a little to loud.
"We aren't watching The Conjuring." I beam and taking a few discs from behind my back. "Our options are Hannah Montana the Movie and The Vampire Di-"
"The Vampire Diaries! The Vampire Diaries!" Paytons high pitch screams fill the air.
"Noooo!" Quintin and Kyle scream.
"The Vampire Diaries it is." I say popping season one into the player.
"But this show is so girly!" Quintin complains.
"Deal with it!" Payton snaps before it started to play.
We watch it until five in the morning and stop at episode ten.
