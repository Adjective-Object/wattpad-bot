At the moment:
//Ro is wrapped into her blanket like a corpse into a rag, stalking a huge ass spider who is on the window of her room. She is typing with her tongue and really considering doing it with her her left nipple. Her hair looks like a abondoned magpie's nest and she just named her pillow Hjörtur, which means "deer" in Icelandic. The spider is coming closer to her and she is thinking about how it would be to catch it with her tongue like frog's do. That made her think about if she's part French. Hjörtur sounds like Arthur in a way... So technically FrUk is happening on her bed... France is on England. Shit. This just turned awkward.//
