In the beginning there was peace,Everything was right until one dark and perilous night.Out of darkness it cameA soulless black bird.It overpowered and took this land of our forefather's.It grew more cunning and fierce,But couldn't see peace.After years of reign two saviors arose, The Raven was wounded, Scared to the bone,Deceived by child of light and of dark.
And from two fated doves there will be three,Three of greatness, Three of desolation,Three of no home,Three who are forsaken,Three who will take the Raven's call,Three who decide the fate of all.
