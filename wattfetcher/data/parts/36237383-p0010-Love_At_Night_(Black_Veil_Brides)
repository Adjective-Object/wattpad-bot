I felt sick. Ashley let me go as I ran out of the ballroom and up to my room. I slammed the door shut and locked it. I kicked my heels off and went straight for my balcony. It was raining outside. I flung the doors opened and climbed over the railing. I dropped landing in the garden below which softened my fall. I started to run down the street. The rain made my dress heavier and my make up to run. I finally reached Andys house and frantically banged on the door. He opened it the door.
"Kat?" He said suprised. He motioned me inside and closed the door. I was dripping all over the marble floor.
"Are you okay?" He asked me. I shook my head and bursted into tears. He tried to confort me but it didnt work. I calmed down so i could speak.
"My father has given Ashley permission to marry me." I told him. He let me go and opened the front door.
"Maybe you should go..."He said. I didnt understand what he was doing. I stood there staring at him.
"Listen Kat... theres no way you can be with a person like me. Im different in many ways and I dont deserve you." He said. I stormed over towards him and closed the door.
"You do deserve me." I said. I pushed him against the wall. He stared into my eyes.
"Show me then." He smirked. I raised an eyebrow. He sighed and pushed me out the way. He walked down the hall and into his bedroom. He slammed the door shut. I walked down the hall and smashed the door open making Andy jump. He swiftly grabbed the sword near him and picked it up.
"I want you to leave." He said calmly. I eyed off the sword. I turned my back on him and left his bedroom... His house and hopefully his life....
