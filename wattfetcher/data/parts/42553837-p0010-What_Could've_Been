There she is, Lauren. The last time I remember, she's Jeff's girlfriend. The dark haired girl looked up at me with a smile. "Hey, T!" She grinned, standing up. "You're back!" She exclaimed, tackling me with a hug.
I giggled. "Hey Laureenie!" I greeted. She pulled back, her green eyes shining because of the light. Suddenly, a light was shone on the green wall behind her. I looked down at my right, seeing a bright diamond ring. "No way! You are..."
"Engaged to Jeff? You know it!" She winked, ruffling my hair. I scowled playfully, hating that she's six inches taller than me. "Whatya need, girl?" I didn't say anything, I just gestured at my body. She chuckled, seeing that I was wearing my night gown and bunny slippers.
"Gotya, now put on this blindfold." She ordered. Not giving me a chance to respond, Lauren wrapped the red blindfold around my head so I couldn't see anything. "L-Lauren!" I stammered. I heard the green-eyed girl laugh, and shuffling was heard throughout the room.
