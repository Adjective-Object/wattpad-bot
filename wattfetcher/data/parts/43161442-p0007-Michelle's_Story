"She told me right before I left that...she didn't want me anymore..." I said solemnly. "She hated me..." I didn't even feel a pang of sadness over her. I hated her, too. A few moments later, there was a knock at the door. Will opened it and Doc came rushing in. He ran over and asked me if I was alright. He looked at the patch on my eye.
"What happened?" Doc asked worriedly. his face was painted with concern. I looked at him, afraid of how he might react.
"She was hit with a ghouled Frieghtgiest slug." Will explained "And...something happened" Before I could do anything Doc pulled the patch off. He turned pale. Tears began to sting my eyes. He hugged me tightly. Will explained what the Shadow Clan said, and Doc seemed to understand it. He carried me on his back out the door.
"Thanks for helping her..." He said. My face was buried between his shoulder blades.
"Your welcome. I hope to see you both again" Will waved to us goodbye. We walked home, our mecha-beast beside us. I must have fallen asleep along the way because I woke up in my bedroom. My life took a weird change that day, and it will never be the same again.
