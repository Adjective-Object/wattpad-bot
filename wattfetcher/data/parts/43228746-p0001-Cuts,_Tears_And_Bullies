"Epilogue"
i may forgive all of you but i can't forget those terrible things you guys made. What done cannot be undone. Broken heart is like a paper, once crushed, it will never be the same.
That's my life. Hai, I'm Ashley. Ashley Styles.
I'm turning 16 in another month but who cares anyways? Well, yeah yeah my family do care but I dislike party anyways. I'm staying with my parents and a older brother. Deep inside me, I'm just a dead soul screaming for revival. No one knows I'm suffering. It goes from cutting to depression and now I'm having bullimia.
My dad was a celebrity in a band called "One Direction", he is Harry Edward Styles. Yes, that's my dad. And he also have 4 amazing mates, which are my uncles.
Let's talk about the nightmare chapter in my life's story,
I have never like my school. Hated school a lot. Schoolmates spirit are bullshit. They don't even look like I'm exist. I cut in school and home. I don't eat that much. After eating I will threw everything out. Can't be help. I'll get hilarious mean notes from the ones bullying me, they'll shove me to the wall and slap me. I almost got rape by those chicks boyfriend but luckily Audrey came to help right in time. Audrey are the popular and kind type of girl and she's very sassy. That makes those bullies don't want to pick up a fight with her.
I only have one bestfriend ; she is Audrey. Audrey Malik. She's Uncle Zayn's daughter. Yes, she know I'm suffering fron all this. She saw my cuts and pain all day long, she tried helping me and not giving up in advicing me but I'm stubborn. Stubborn as fuck.
How long can I survive ? Should I tell mum and dad ? Would Damian, my brother do something to stop the bullying in my school for me?
One day, a guy from a party make me fall for him. I thought of running away. Not wanting to come back would be the smartest thing to do but no. He makes me think of him and he makes me fall for him. Fall really hard.
I always wonder would he loves me back like how I do?
