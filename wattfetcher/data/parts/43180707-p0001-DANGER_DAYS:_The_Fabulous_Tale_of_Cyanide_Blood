The year was 2069. I was 69 years old. I was in the hospital because I am old and my ass got kicked by BLI due to me defending my stupid husband (still love him tho) just because he forgot to clean one of the rooms of the industry he works.
BLI Industries took over Battery City ten years ago. It was total caos, harm and unhappy people were everywhere. We lived in oppression. We were caged birds at the moment. No freedom, we couldn't say nothing against BLI or its minions, the so called Dracs and that stupid pill.
Oh, how I miss the danger days, were killjoys were taking over this city with the war and we were saving people from that awful world. It was the happiest moments of my life. I'm old now, and I can't do nothing besides telling my story to my three grandchildren, which they think I'm crazy. They just don't deserve this fascist world. I miss going on missions to ghost some Dracs with my husband. Those were wild, wild, happy days.
-Hey mom
Oh shit, it's my son. I also heard some kid noises outside. I think he brought his kids
-NANA!!-said the youngest one, while hugging me
The youngest one adored me. He actually like my stories. He hugs me so tight sometimes.
-Hey gradma!-The other ones said, and of course, they were eating food from the vending machine.
-Hi kids, you know that I hate when you guys eat from the vending machines.
They gave me this odd look like if I was crazy for not eating from the vending machines.
-Hey mom, I'm going to visit dad, would you stay with them?
-Of course dear let them with me.
My son was really concerned about my husband. They are really close and he is worse then me.
The thing that I don't about he leaving his kids with me is that the little one, Jack, only listens to me while the other ones, Kaleb and Cassie just black out. Sometimes Cassie listens but Kaleb, ugh.
Kaleb and Cassie were 9 years old while Jack was 5. They were all cuties. I still remember when they were babies.
-Gradma, why don't you like when me and Kaleb eat from the vending machine?- Cassie asked me kinda scared
-Because I'm scared that BLI putted something like the ''happy pill'' on those food.
-PF they wouldn't do that...- Complained Kaleb. He was always against me.
-Listen here kiddo, do you know what BLI is capable of? Do you know what they did? or what they do now?
-uh... I guess I...
-You don't. -I said, getting a bit smart on him.
-Yeah and what the deal? BLI just want good for us...
-You don't know what you're talking about, you weren't there! -I kinda shouted
He was a smartass, he wasn't there to know what happened... The war... The rise and fall... Horrible times...
-THEN TELL US WHAT HAPPENED THEN!- He shouted
-FIRST OF ALL YOUNG SMALL YOU LOW YOUR TONE OR I'LL TELL YOUR FATHER!
-sorry...
-yeah gradma tell us what really happen!- said Cassie with curiosity
This was the first time I saw her interested
I'm going to tell them how it all started
''-Well, it was 2019...
