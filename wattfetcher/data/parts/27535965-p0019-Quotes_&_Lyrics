"I think everybody sees things differently. For example; the sky. To some it would be a huge space above, to others it would be where the birds fly around. To some it would be nothing, to others it would be anything and everything. To some it would be freedom, to others it would be just blue. To some it would be stars. Yet, to others, it could be what they never got to reach."
~ Tatiana C. R. F. (aka; me)
I was on my drive home when I thought this. The sky was BEAUTIFUL. There was only one line of clouds visible. It looked fluffy yet like cotton condy and small. The other clouds were practically confused by the far mountains. And the colors, oooh my god. They went from a light faded blue to pink, from pink to a thin line of purple, from purple to yellow. And from yellow it went slowly and fadedly to a dark night sky blue. (erm ma gawd i sound so poetic). It was about 6pm when I saw it.
Ps. the picture above/on the side is a picture i had taken over a year ago back in December 2013 of garden.
