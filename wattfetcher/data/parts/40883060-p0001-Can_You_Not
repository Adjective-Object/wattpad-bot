" Wake Up " I hear Megan and Carson say.

" I have awoken from hibernation "
" Let's get packing we leave in two hours, so get up lazy bones "
Kyky is still asleep. I see Carson and Megan carry a big tub of water and i know what yhey are going to do.
SPLASH
" CARSON, MEGAN " I hear a angry kyky say.
" Yah"
" WHY AM I COVERED IN WATER " She screams riht into my ear. Oww
Megan and Carson run down the stairs and kyky chasing right after them. Me, Megan, Audrey , and Kyky live together in California in a small apartment. We are headed to France for fashion week.
We will be modeling some of the most famous clothing. We are all models that's how we met. We were at a event in Santa Monica and we were paired up to run down the runway in pink glas shoes.
Ever sinve then we have been together.
I get up and walk down stairs. I decided to make pancakes for the first time.
