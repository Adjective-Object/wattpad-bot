"Goodnight." I said closing my eyes, he took the blankets off and I turned to look at him, Jake started to whimper, I pick him up and he was shaking, "Aww babe, you scared him." I said I cuddled Jake and he wagged his tail, I put him in the middle of us and Jake stood on my chest and laid there.
I scooted next to Hayes, and he wrapped his arms around me and kissed my head, "Goodnight." I look at him, "Goodnight." he whispered and we kissed, and I fell asleep.
