So today my friend was really sad and no one knew what to say so like one of my friends saw he was crying and he laughed and said "HAHAHAHAH fag"
And my crying friend laughed because we don't use that to offend each other Because they're all straight
Except for me apparentlySo they cannot call me fag
Oh and I have this ugly bruise on my arm and I kept punching it to build up endurance
I asked my crying friend to punch itAnd I thinkHeLetOutAllHisPainOnMyArm
Now it hurts to touch itXD
ALSO HOW DO PEOPLE HAVE PERSONAL ACcounts?It's so weirdI asked my friend what I was supposed to comment and they said "Tell them they're pretty"And I just replied "I don't do lies though D:"
