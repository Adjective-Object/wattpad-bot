Germany shuffled nervously and spoke, "Well, we-"



"I-I see! Listen, we were looking for you guys! What happened to the others?" Italy cut in, facing Past England.


Germany creased his forehead and turned to Italy. "H-hey-"


"Oh, they split up, too. There are a lot of rooms that we can't open, so we'll eventually meet up again. I'll check out the next room now." Past England explained.


Italy smiled and nodded. "I see! Thanks! We're also going to look around, then!"


Nodding back, Past England walked up the hall, leaving Italy and Germany in the center hall. The two looked at each other nervously.


Germany gave the Italian a puzzled look. "Italy...why-"



Biting his lip, Italy looked at him in distress. "This is terrible, Germany! Somehow, we've wound up in the past-"



"What?!" Germany took a step back.



Frowning, Italy nodded. "I'm sure of it. The way I just acted-That's the way I acted in the beginning, when I still struggled to keep you from coming to this house."


Digesting the information, Germany just stood in silence, waiting for Italy to elaborate.



"Also, this is the second time loop. Everything I said or did was useless. I still wasn't used to going back in time at all and made a lot of mistakes. I shouldn't have said those things right there...Oh, but I didn't know where the key was yet...I was wrong from the beginning." Italy continued, sighing.



Germany clenched his fists tightly. "I'm sorry..."


"Ve? Why are you apologising?" Italy asked, confused by his friend's action.


Rubbing his arm, Germany spoke, "Well...when your past...tried to warm me, I didn't listen and laughed when you got so desperate to stop me..."


"Ahaha, it's okay! That was because I couldn't explain myself well. Of course no one will believe you when all you say is, 'Just believe me!'..." Italy told him.
