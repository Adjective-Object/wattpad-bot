Its been a long time since you heard the last of Freddy Frazbear's Pizzaria but you still dont mind playing the game once in a while. You smile as you beat Night 3 of the 3rd game. You check the time and it reads 11:08. "Might as well get going because I have a long night ahead" you mumble as you get dressed and get ready to be the new nightguard for Freddy Fazbear's pizzaria.
