I wake up with my heart beating and sweat dripping down my cheeks. I rub my forehead trying to think of what I dreamed, but I got nothing. I get up from my cot and start to go down stairs and to my kitchen, and I'm greeted with unwanted guests.
"Good morning, Quinn. How did you sleep?" Says one, with a grimy voice.
"What are you doing here?" I hiss.
"Trying to get a good dinner. What do you think," he walks over to me and grabs my arm. "I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I must." He motions for the other men to come closer to us.
"I'm not going with you. I rather die than partake in what he is doing," I kick down one man, then punch the one holding my arm in the gut. I summon up a portal to another place, but before I enter, I get tackled down to the ground.
"Where do you think you're going, missy?"
Before I can say anything back, I get punched on my right cheek. Hard. The man gets off of me and pulls me up, holding my arms behind my back. "Come on now. This doesn't have to be so hard." He walks to the door, pushing me along with him. The other men follow.  "Oh. And just to make sure..." He looks over at another man as hr pulls out a small object. "You do the honors, Jeff," he tosses it over to Jeff.   "Three. Two. One," Jeff presses down onto the button, and I'm being dragged off.
