In a car, truck, or vehicle you usually listen to the radio, right?
I was riding in a vehicle and in a traffic jam. It was very quiet, no one was talking in the vehicle. The radio suddenly shut off. Then, the driver turned it back on. There was a dripping sound, that is all you could here is dripping. There was a man talking in the background, I could barely here him. But, what could make out is that he said,"Don't look behind you." Of course, I was tempted to look behind me but, his voice was too scary so I listened to him. All of the 5 hours that were left of the drive I didn't think about anything but that man's voice saying,"Don't look behind you." In a commanding voice that sounded like batman's voice.
