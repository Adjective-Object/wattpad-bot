ARIANA'S POV
1 day later
We just got off our jet and right now we're driving to Ross' aunts house, the others are already there so we're just gonna meet them there. I'm in the back seat with Riley, she sleeping in her car seat and Ross is driving
Ariana - I would really appreciate it if you would drive a bit slower
Ross - I am driving slow, I dont think I can go any slower
Ariana - Well I think your going too fast
Ross - What's your problem?, you keep telling me to drive slow, we might as well stop the damn car
Ariana - I just don't want anything to happen to Riley, ok?
Ross - She'll be fine
Ariana - That's what you said a month ago
Ross - Are you still upset about that?!
Ariana - Keep your voice down!, Riley's sleeping. And yes I'm still upset because you were being a fool, we could've died
Ross - But we didn't
Ariana - That's not the point-
Ross - Then what is?!
Ariana - The point is that you DONT listen!--
Ross - Look who's talking
Ariana - Oh would you shut up?, that car accident was a hundred percent your fault!
Ross - Well maybe if you weren't arguing with me about baby bottles we wouldn't have crashed!
Ariana - Maybe if you would have just agreed to buy all pink baby bottles we wouldn't have been arguing about it!
Ross - I still think yellow bottles would be better
Ariana - Just shut up and drive, unless you want to crash again?
Ross - I said I was sorry!
Ariana - Well sorry doesn't make it any better does it?
Ross - Can't you just forgive and forget?
Ariana - What the--

Ariana - No!, no no no. No. I'll take her inside, and you can just get the suitcases
Ross - Fine
