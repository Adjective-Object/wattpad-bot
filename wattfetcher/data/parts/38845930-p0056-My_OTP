Jordan's POV
--this a few days after Erin is fully moved in, probably around three or four months later... btw Erin's cast is off now--
I've been nervous all day about this, we just moved in together and I'm not sure about it... anything could happen now.
"Erin?" I asked I think as nervous as I could get.
"What's up?"
"What's next?" I asked.
"Wait, what?" She asked.
"What do we do next? What do you think?" I asked.
"What? What are you talking about?" She asked.
"Never mind. I love you." I said.
"Okay then, love you too... weirdo."
"I don't know what -- what I was gonna say." I said being untruthful.
"Okay." She said. I was going to ask her about living together, what might have a higher chance of happening and if she was okay with it.
"Well."
"Sorry, I -- " I said before just walking away.
"Jordan!? What was that?" She asked following me.
"I don't even know."
"Sure, Jordan."
"I'm just really happy, I love you."
"I love you... but what was that?" She asked again.
"We are living together, I can just walk up to you and say "hi" at any point in time and it won't be over the phone... you're always here." I said with a smile.
"Yeah Jordan, I know." She said holding my arms pulling me twards her.
I laughed before kissing her. "It also means I can do this more." I said before squeezing her side making her squeal and run, I chased her through the halls occasionally getting to tickle her until she cornered herself.
"Boo, help me! Ahh!" She screamed.
"What!?" Boo screamed running twards us... I tickled her as well. We laughed and tickled each other for a little kissing Erin every once in a while.
Boo jumped from the bed onto my back, I almost feel over.
"Boo!" Erin screamed.
"She's fine." I said walking away.
I walked around doing things for a few minutes with Boo just hanging off my back, I wasn't even holding her.
"Are you and mom gonna get married?" She asked. Erin and I whipped our heads to each other.
"What!?" Erin screamed.
"Are you getting married?" She asked again.
"No! Why would you ask that, Boo?" She snapped.
"Maybe." I said.
Erin hit my arm and made a really mad face.
"It's not like it's not a posiblity, we live together now." I said looking at her mad face.
"Really?" Boo asked.
"Yeah, really... in all seriousness? You had to say that?" Erin asked holding her face in one hand.
"Yes I did." I said before moving her hand away and kissing her.
"Eww!" Boo screamed before jumping off my back and running away.
