But it was too late; you were already headed here...


In the end, no matter how many times I go back in time, I can't go back to before I told America about this house.


The ten of us always come here. Even if the groups change. Always." Italy told them, starting to shake a little.


Canada nodded in understanding. "So that's what the memories of coming here with different people are all about. We kept coming here in various patterns."


"That's right. But in the second time loop, I couldn't save England, China, or America, and I survived again." Italy said in a depressed tone.


Japan's head shot up as he let out, "What?!"


Italy, not hearing Japan, continued, "So, once again..."



America waved his hands in front of him to catch his attention. "Stop, stop! Hold on. In the second time loop, er...I did survive, didn't I?"


"What?!" Italy exclaimed, utterly confused.


Japan stepped forward and spoke, "Yes, it is just as America said. It is difficult for me to say it, but... Italy, you were the only one who...in the room right behind you..."


"I'm the only one who died? What? That's impossible..." Italy rambled in an exasperated tone.


England tilted his head and suggested, "Maybe you're just confused due to going through that too many times?"


Italy shook his head. "The second time wasn't the same as the first time, but I still remember it perfectly. Besides, if I died, who made time go back?"



"Ah, yes, Italy is the only one who can go back in time. That wouldn't fit... or would it?" Russia wondered.


Japan was starting to get exasperated himself from the confusion. "But we saw it when we broke that clock! Even Italy said in all certainty that it was the second time."


"I...can confirm that it's true. I also saw the same thing as Japan did. So did America." (Name) said, rubbing her elbow.
