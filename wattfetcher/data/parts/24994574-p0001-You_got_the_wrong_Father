Christy's P.O.V.
~
I sat down on the couch turning on the news.
All of a sudden my 9 year old daughter Laci walked in. Sitting down next to me.
"Hey lace. Whatcha need?"
"Mom. I need to know who my dad is!"
I almost fell off the couch. I knew this day would come but, I didn't think it would come this soon.
"Why do you need to know?"
"Mom. It's my dad I need to know who helped made me"
"Omg are you seriously saying who helped made you?!"
"Yep" she said popping the P.
All of a sudden I had an idea. I wouldn't tell her exactly she would just have to figure it out herself.
"Mom. Hello?"
"Okay. Well I'm not gonna tell you exactly your gonna need to figure it out yourself."
"How can I do that?"
"I'm gonna tell you 3 stories."
"Okay"
"Gonna change there names."
"Okay"
"Gonna alter their stories a little bit."
"Okay."
"And you'll just need to figure it out yourself."
"Deal."
"Okay. Let's get these stories on the road."
