"Okay bye." I said he chuckled and walked back to his room, I walked in my room. I crawled back to Hayes, he stroked my hair and kissed my forehead. "I love you." Hayes said, I looked at Hayes, he was blushing, "I love you too." I smiled leaning in to kiss him.
" keep it PG-13 kids." Nash said, we quickly pulled away and I looked at the door to see Nash, Nash came in and gave me a huge hug saying he was sorry, "Please tell everyone I forgive them well first ask them if they are sorry then say it." I said he nodded.
"What do you want to do now?" He asked, I shrugged, I laid on him with my legs on each side of him, "Do you want to go in the pool?" I asked, "Yeah." he sat up holding my back I got off and went to put on my tie dye bikini, I grabbed a cover up and Hayes went to his house quickly changing while I sat on the balcony waiting for him.
"You ready?" A shirtless Hayes asked from his balcony, "Yeah." I said and he walked out his house to my back yard, I walked out there to meet him.
We jumped in and I played music from my phone, we kissed again I wrapped my legs around his waist and my hands on his cheeks.
"Get a room!" Cameron yelled, I giggled pulling away, "Happy 15th birthday babe." I said to Hayes, he looked up at Cameron's window it said happy 15th birthday Hayes with hearts and I made a collage of us together. "I love it babe." Hayes said pulling me to his lips.
He spun us around, into the waterfall, "Ahh!" I scream not loudly, he lets me go and he smiles, "Best surprise ever." he said, "Thank you baby." he said kissing me again, "Your welcome  Hayes." I said pulling away then kissing him again.
