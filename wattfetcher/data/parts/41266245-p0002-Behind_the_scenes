Chris: ''Anyway, what you finna make for us?'' he asked.
me: ''I'm ordering take out, I don't know about you,'' I said crossing my arms over my chest. I saw him shift his eyes away from me. That mean he's up to something. ''What did you do?'' I asked.
Chris: ''I may have told a couple of people that you were cooking, so to come over,'' he said sheepishly.
me: ''How many people are we talkin, Chris?'' I said scared of what he would say. he looked down, and I pushed past him to the front door. I opened it to see Tyga, Nicki, August, Terrae, Renee, Royalty, Christina, and King cairo. ''Come in,'' I said stepping aside. They came in and I looked back towards the kitchen. ''If you hear something, don't check what it is,'' I said as I lead them to the living room.
Terrae: ''Did you put the Xbox up? I want to play while you think of ways to kill Chris,'' she asked sitting down on the couch.
Me: ''Probably the same place that you left it,'' I said before going in the kitchen.
Chris was now feeding Niyah her potatoes, it was his duty, him being the God Father and all..
Me: "y'know i should kill you right," i stated, making him jump, and Niyah laugh.
Chris: "why?" He asked acting all innocent when he know he not.
Me: "beacuse, i'm not cooking! I don't have anything to COOK!" I exclaimed.
Chris: "so, just order takeout, like you said," he said, and i nodded, i walked back out, not before Aniyah was reaching for me. i picked her up and went back out to the living room.
When i went back out there Tyga, August, and Terrae we playing COD on the XBox.
Nicki turned to my and smiled.
Nicki: "You not cookin," she stated before laughing, "he did the same to me a couple of weeks ago, we ended up going out to eat."
Me: "well, i'm ordering takeout," i said before addressing the whole group, "pizza or Chinese?"
