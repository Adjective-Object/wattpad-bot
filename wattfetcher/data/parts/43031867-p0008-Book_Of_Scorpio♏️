They will tell themselves they are above anger, and for the most part, that's true. They'll stay on the defensive side and get far away from you as possible, not because they are scared of you, but because they are afraid of the damage they will do when they get angry. Some anger will show through their glaring eyes, sarcasm, and brutal criticism. They may never let it go when they get truly angry at you.
