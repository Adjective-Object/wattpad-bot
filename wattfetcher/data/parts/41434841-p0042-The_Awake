I'm done. I'm sorry just. I can't do this. I keep having panic attacks. I keep having nightmares. I can't watch my friends die anymore. Tonight it was Ryan and then Jordan.
God just. Speaking of Ryan. I missed probably my only chance to talk to him. And then I just kept sending him messages and bothering him. I probably ruined whatever could've happened. I just want him back. I want to be able to tell him I love him. If anything what's hurting me is the false hope I have. I just want to be able to speak to him. He made my mood 20x better. But he said goodbye. And look where I am now. All of this because someone left my life. I'm fucking pathetic. Great job me.
Oh and that panic attack I had. Just A+. I got yelled at.
I'm just ready to die. It's not like Ryan will come back now. I ruined my chance. And just. I had a chance. And I was on the bus.Just. I want to punch myself.
I want to die without him.
