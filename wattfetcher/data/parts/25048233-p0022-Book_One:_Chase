"Two Strawberry Parfaits for you guys." Golf made a quick glance on me and followed up with, "I know this is your favorite. Enjoy!"
"Again, you might be mistaking me for someone else. This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of dessert." I reiterated. Why does he keep on insisting that he knows me or something?
"Ah... It's bec-", Ice interrupted Golf before he can finish talking.
"It's what they say to customers. Their parfaits are pretty good so they're sure that it will be their customer's favorite." He looked up to Golf, who was clearly confused as I am, then to me and smiled.
"Yeah, I guess. Call me if you need me. I'll be at the counter." Golf walked away, dumbfounded.
"Sure. Thanks for the hard work Golf," Ice approved.
I started eating my parfait and I can say that Ice is right. It's very creamy but not too sweet. It certainly is something that can be favored by many. The strawberries tasted like they were freshly picked! It's not even strawberry season yet.
"I see you're enjoying your parfait. I told you, it's their best-seller here!"
I blushed. I forgot I was still in a "date" with him. "Y-yeah. You're right."
He smiled in return.
==========================================================
After eating a hearty breakfast and saying our goodbyes to Golf, Ice received a call. His face went sad for a moment but he smiled when he noticed me looking at him.
"Who called?" I asked without thinking.
"Aha! You seem interested!" His face gives off a feeling that he has caught me doing bad or something.
"W-what? I was just curious. Never mind then." I looked away and let out a defeated sigh.
"I'm just kidding. That was my mom. She told me to accompany my sister to the airport. She had this emergency with her company and needed help with her things."
"Ahhh..." I felt somewhat disappointed. I don't understand why, but it certainly made me kind of... sad. "I-I guess this is where our date ends. Whew. What a relief!"
"Don't worry Chase. There will be more to come. I just need to help my sister this time. Don't be too disappointed." He said mockingly.
"I-I'm not d-disappointed!"
"If you say so... And oh, stop blushing. Haha!"
"W-what?!"
"Bye now. See you at class!"
"..." I was left speechless. I mean, I did not even feel my face get hot. Is he toying with me?
==========================================================
The "date" was unexpectedly short. I'm pretty sure I didn't like the idea but it left me disappointed. I don't know why but it made me wanting for more. I tried shaking everything off of my mind but they keep returning. "What is with Ice? I hate him but at the same time..." Am I starting to like him?
"Hey loveboy! Get downstairs. We need help with the stuff Ma and Pa brought with them."
"Okay okay, I'm coming!"
I went down as Mel instructed and saw this huge box outside. It's a brand new TV! I hurriedly went to where my family is and found out that it's not just a television â€“ it's a whole "Movie Theater" set!
