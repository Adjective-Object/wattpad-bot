I turned the corner into the class and sat down, he didn't talk after what he asked me, he walked silently behind me, he walked into class a little later, and sat down, this time not even looking at me.

"I'm sorry but my aunt needs me to go, and I sort of want to go, I haven't been since my mum died, and I think it would be good for me, it's only for the weekend," I was sitting on my bed,
Rose was begging me to go to a party that I didn't want to go to, and there was actually something that I had planned, I was going to Portrush with my aunt and her two kids, it's a Sunday school trip,
Me, my mum, my brother and her used to go all the time every year during the summer, but this year, it was in February, because something else was apparently going on,
I haven't went since, my mum died and I guess, science I'm back here I should go, "but it's Friday, let loose," rose cried as she begged on her knees, Catherine rolled her eyes and so did I.
"No," "yes," "nO," yES" "NO," "YESS," we argued and I huffed, wow why am is so huffy? "Fine," her eyes lit up and she jumped up and down clapping her hands, "but," she stopped and pouted, "1. I'm not drinking and 2. Neither are you, 3. I'm driving there and back, 4. All this is towards you too," I said pointing to Catherine, "I didn't even want to go but I guess if none of us are drinking that'll be fine," I nodded, "okay let's get ready," she clapped,
It was currently 5pm and the party starts at 7 so they could use my clothes, because it's sort of weird how all of us are the same size in everything, "mark will be there," rose said from inside my closet, u rolled my eyes, "don't care," "we have dates," what, "who?"
"Oh just, Parker, Luke, and Noel," she said getting excited, "seniors," which where hot if I say so myself.
"Oh my god," rose and Catherine said at the same time pulling a dress each from my walk-in wardrobe, I seen a dress I liked, my aunt must have picked it when we went Christmas shopping, that was her present to me.
Three showers later are hair and body's were dry and we got dressed, I was wearing a black dress that came to mid thigh, it had a gold pinky colour sparkle around the top, my hair was a little wavy and my makeup was dark, I put on a pair of feather earrings and a feather necklace and threw on some sparkly black heels, and a black wallet.
Rose was wearing a blue and white, dress with white heels, her hair was natural and her make up was dark too, she wore a pair of further looking earrings and a black diamond necklace, and a white wallet.
Catherine wore a white and black dress with black heels,black stud earrings, and a beaded necklace a black wallet and her make up was dark and glittery her hair was curly.
It was 20 to 7 and we were in the car, driving to see are dates at a party/club thing, they called it, "the 69," great name,

I walked in the music way to loud, the strobe lights where blinding and at the tables was a very dim light,
"Hi I'm Luke," he shook my hand and put his head on my lower back and lead me to the table after he looked me up and down then smirked at me.

The 69 really? I rolled my eyes at the name and drunk some more of my beer, "hey mark isn't that rose?" Jackson asked, "and her friends, wait is that.....Emily?" When her name was mentioned I ran my eyes over everyone at the front entrance.
