"Peachy."
Before the second corner, Aya left sick again and thus ducked her head in the confusion of the voices of the two males.

*Even more silence*
Law activated his room and they were out of the tunnel immediately, also Law's nodachi was in his hands.
"MUGIWARA-YA!" Law exclaimed unsheathing his nodachi, "I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD!"
"RUN!" Luffy exclaimed, running from an already furious Law. Aya on the other hand, was killing her self laughing the pool. This made Shanks and Marco's sweatdrops double.
Back to Ace and Sakura....
"Love Tunnel?! I wonder that means- OI!" Sakura started before viciously roaring a the person who was now sleeping.
"Oi Ace!" Sakura exclaimed shaking his shoulders.
"ACE WAKE THE FUCK UP!" Sakura shouted shaking his shoulders even harder, because of the dark tunnel up ahead.
Until the others, her entire ride down that was spent, trying to avoid the massive male from potentially drowning her...which happened eventually.
Ace's body was ontop of Sakura's own and he just kept sleeping. When she saw the light, she turned into her dragon form and flew out of the tunnel much to the added confusion of Marco and Shanks, who saw the dragon crash land into a nearby coconut tree.
"ACE! WAKE THE FUCK UP, YOU DAMN NARCOLPSY BASTARD!" Sakua shouted, sitting ontop of Ace and slapping his face until it turned a new shade of purple.
"What the hell happened in those tunnels?"
"I don't want to know-yoi."
{To those who are ultimately confused confused, see te picture above. It applies to two expect Sakura.}
