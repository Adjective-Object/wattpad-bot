"Hey Milly how's Lyle?" Emma asked sarcastically."I don't know I don't stalk him just because I think he's cute". I had been crushing on Lyle for two years now and he only found out on Sunday when we went to the beach -embarrassing much."It was all your fault I never had to kiss him!" Emma had made me kiss him, by pushing me towards the water and Lyle tried to stop me but we both fell in and he whispered,"I need to kiss you now, do you like me?" I swear I nearly fainted."yeah I kinda have for two years now." And then he kissed me the only down-side was that Emma filmed the entire thing!
Now its Monday and everybody's going to find out and then they will all know that 1.I have liked Lyle for two years and 2.That we kissed.
