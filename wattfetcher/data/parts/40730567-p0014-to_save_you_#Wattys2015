It is a lot easier to be lost than found. It's the reason we're always searching, and rarely discovered- so many locks, not enough keys. -Sarah Dessen

Jake was slowly growing impatient. After almost a month of texting, he wanted to see who that girl was. Someone who could make him feel better, just by their words. Someone he was, maybe, falling for. He didn't want to admit it at first, since the idea was insane. Falling in love with someone he has never met? It was absurd. But he couldn't help but be awed by her words. Even if it was a girl.

Look, here is the thing. You might think I am some pretty girl, but I am not. I don't have a pretty face. All I have are words. I have been in love with you for a long time now, and I don't want you to see me. Maybe someday, when we're both ready. But just not yet.

i have three possible endings for the story:
1) happy ending where everything is rainbows and sunshine in the end
2) bittersweet
3) really sad ending

rn i am kind of thinking about the really sad ending, bc that is what is most appropriate in my opinion. but i want to know what you guys want too.
