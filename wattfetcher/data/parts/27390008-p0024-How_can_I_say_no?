Not long after Johnny had taken Samantha out for dinner, they returned to set and continued filming. Three long months later, they were done with the movie. Tim was so happy filming was over. He organized a party for everyone involved with the movie. Samantha was dressed up in the same dress she had worn to the last date she had with Johnny. She looked over at him. Johnny was fussing with his hair in the mirror. It had grown out and become brown again. Samantha smiled as she walked over and helped him sort it out.
"Thank you." Johnny said as he looked down at Samantha. She smiled.
"Your welcome. You look handsome." Samantha said. Johnny shook his head.
"Nah. You are truly beautiful." He said. Samantha laughed.
"If you're not handsome, I'm not beautiful." She said. Johnny placed his hands in her hips and pulled her towards him.
"Fine if it means you'll believe me when I say you're beautiful then thank you for calling me handsome." He said. Samantha giggled.
"Better. But not by much." She said as she placed her hands on his shoulders. Johnny smiled at her and leaned down. Their lips were about to touch when they heard someone knock on the door.
"Hurry up you two! Party starts in ten minutes!" Tim yelled. Johnny sighed.
"We'll be right down." Johnny yelled back. Samantha slipped away from him and put on her heels. Johnny straightened his jacket and turned around. Samantha stood up and did a small twirl for him.
"What you think?" She asked. Johnny smiled and offered her his arm.
"Absolutely beautiful." He said. Samantha giggled and hooked her arm with his. They went downstairs and walked into the ballroom. Tim had rented out the entire ballroom, a dj, and a few other things for the party. Samantha smiled when she saw the ballroom. Tim had spared no expense when he planed the party. There was a disco ball and a bar. It looked just like a club. Johnny smiled at the look on Samantha's face. He led her to the bar where he ordered them two cokes.
"And here I was thinking you'd try to get me drunk tonight." Samantha joked as she took a sip of her drink. Johnny smiled.
"Maybe later. But then again, you don't drink. So how would I get you drunk?" He asked. Samantha smiled.
"Maybe I'll get you drunk." She said. Johnny pulled her close.
"Maybe I already am." Johnny whispered in her ear. Samantha laughed.
"How would you be drunk?" She asked. Johnny shrugged.
"Off you. I love you." Johnny said. He smiled at her.
"I love you too." She said. Samantha turned so she could watch what was going on around her. She leaned against Johnny who wrapped his arm around her. They stood there against the bar for some time. About half an hour after they got to the party, Johnny started to drink. Soon Samantha heard "if I fell" by the Beatles come on. She turned to face Johnny.
"Johnny, please dance with me." She asked. Johnny shook his head.
"Dont dance." Johnny said. He was a bit drunk by this point. Samantha pouted.
"Please. Don't think of it as dancing. Think of it as goofing around." She said. She started to pull Johnny onto the dance floor. Johnny shook his head.
"But love. There's all these people watching." He complained. Samantha giggled.
"Just pay attention to me. Like you always do." She said. Johnny shook his head but put his hands on her hips anyway. Samantha put her arms around his neck. They started to dance. "See? It's not so bad." She said. Johnny smirked.
