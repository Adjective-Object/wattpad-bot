"Is this your boyfriend?" I asked, holding the photo strip to my face. Typical popular. Cheating on their boyfriends, I thought to myself.
"No, he's my best friend, Bryan. He's also my next door neighbor. And is currently in the back trunk right now," she said, parking the car into a huge school, I'm definitly going to get lost.
"What? Why?" I asked cautiously. If she's a murderer, and I die... I will never live with my self. I almost laughed at the inside joke that I had just made. But I didn't.
"I don't know. I... don't.... know - what the hell is he doing in there?!" She asked herself, getting out of the car and opening the trunk. "What the hell? Get out," she said, to the person in the trunk.
"Aw... Fine. See ya," another hot guy (what is this place? Hot guy city?) said, jumping out of the trunk and walking past me, who was still in the car.
"Hey beautiful," he said, giving me a peace sign and walking inside the school.
"Sorry about him... he's.... a piece of work. But..." I stared at her, waiting for her explanation on why the fuck he was in the car trunk, she opened her mouth again, but nothing came out and I smirked. "Nice best friend you got there."
"Hey, look," she says sharply, "You don't have to be mean about him. I mean, he may be kind of stupid, but he's still my best friend, little miss new gir -" I cut her off.
"No, I mean, nice best friend you got there, as in, he seems fun to hang with. I hope I can hang with him too."
I was serious too, that guy seemed fun and chill.
She grinned and I knew she like me. At least I've got one friend so far.
