Nicolas wanted to say that the woman had seen him naked, for God's sake, when he had thought no one had been home. And then there she was, staring at him like she had never seen a nude man before. If she were to look away as if it wasn't such a big deal, then he wouldn't have growl at her. But not. The oriental beauty had to blush and stared at him as if she wanted to eat him alive. And damn his own body. He responded to the stare and look of pure desire in those enchanting dark brown eyes. He was bloody turned on by her sight and had desperately wanted to grab her into his arms, kiss her, and do so much more to her than his logical mind permitted. For the first time in his twenty-nine years, Nicolas had never felt like he wanted any woman like he wanted Akira.
"Then I shall personally tell our lovely Akira that she can come up to enjoy the garden anytime she wants," Tristan said, nodding his head.
Nicolas nudged his glasses up the bridge of his nose and cleared his throat. "Do whatever you bloody want." With that, he headed out the door.
Tristan blinked and said, "What did I say wrong?"
Logan laughed. "I think Akira is getting under his skin."
