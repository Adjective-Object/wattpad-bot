So @Alan___AshbyÂ and I decided to do another collab together the first chapter will be up soon but this story won't really start until our other collab is finished but let us know what you think! Comment, Vote, Follow give us feedback! -Gabi


Pierce The Veil and Of Mice and Men are going on tour together, but when their photographer the one and only Adam Elmakias falls ill they're in need of a photographer to take his place before leaving on tour.
Then Phil ends up finding the perfect photographer though, Alan Ashby.
An up and coming photographer who's still trying to make a name for himself.
Austin quickly gains interest in their new photographer but with a crazy ex-boyfriend and a photographer who is strictly with them for business.
Who knows what will be caught on camera.
Kellin Quinn is the new Merchandise Manager and he's going to have a lot on his hands as he juggles with taking on all of the responsibilities of being in charge of all of the merch, taking on the challenge of overseeing all of the merch girls and boys and  most of all dealing with the moody lead singer of his favorite band.
Vic has been a complete and total jerk ever since he caught his ex-girlfriend and former Merchandise Manager cheating on him. But when Jaime introduces him to their new merch manager Vic only brushes him off like nothing knowing he's just another fan and someone who will screw him over in the end. But he can't help but to be entranced by this raven haired boy that is quickly becoming friends with everyone on tour.
But, maybe he's not just a fan.
