He chuckled nervously as he rubbed the back of his head. He met my eyes and I can say this now because he too has blue eyes like the demon but his blue eyes are calm and filled with kindness.
I was standing there, staring at my best friend, his blonde not so curly hair was messy. He had earphones on but one of it was dangling like crazy.
I asked him why he was running and he explained he heard about me partnering up with Verren from the other students.
Wow, news does get around fast.
Ronald is really concern about me when it comes Verren and I. He knows all about my misfortune around him and he is always around me unless those misfortunes happen.
"Hey, about the partnering up thing, are you gonna survive that?" He pulled out one of his earphones and continued walking besides me.
I chuckled at his sentence. He glanced at me with a confused look. "I wouldn't be worried. I think he is the one who should be worried because he won't survive me." I explained.
Ronald nodded and scoffed. "I don't know why this keeps going on."
"What do you mean, Ronny?" I rose an eyebrow.
He sighed roughly. "I meant, why do your hate for each other keeps going on? Why can't both of you stop and just ignore each other?"
"It's not easy, Ronny..." I sighed.
It was true sadly. It's really hard to ignore the person you hate when you see them everywhere.
After endless trying to get an answer out of me, Ronald finally stopped.
I thanked whoever was will to receive it for making Ronald stop talking.
He kept a straight a face for our long awkward walk to class. I tried to joke with him but he seemed like he wasn't in the mood for my jokes.
