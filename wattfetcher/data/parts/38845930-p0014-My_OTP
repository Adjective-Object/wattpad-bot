Jordan's POV
"Baby?" I yelled down the hall.
"What?" she said as she ran down the hall smiling, then she put her hands in mine and kissed me
"I love you." I said then kissed her "You're so beautiful today, stop it." I said as her hands went to the back of my neck.
"Oh, Jordan." she said in the sweetest most adorable way
"Help me set up the lights?" I asked
"Yeah." she said
"Thank you."
A while later after the video, Erin and I went to eat some SUSHI and stuff.
"I love sushi." She said.
"I know, that's why we're here." I said.
Me and Erin ate and got so full we thought we were gonna burst.
"Oh my god, I'm so full." She said.
"Me too." I responded
We went back to my house and just sat on the couch lazily.
"You know what?" I asked.
"What?"
"I FREAKING love you? Eww." I said in utter disgust and sarcasm.
"Oh, Jordan." She said while kissing me.
"Well, I don't love you, I FREAKING LOVE YOU!" She screamed while throwing herself onto my legs, kissing me and holding my neck. I grabbed her side with one hand and her hip with the other. I felt her ribs move as she repositioned on my lap.
"No way." She said breathing heavily.
"What?" I asked.
"Just no way." She responded.
"You're so cute, and you're beautiful." I said while looking at her. Erin's eyes were so bright green that they almost looked like lights.
She growled while biting her lip and squinting her eyes. The way that she is all the time... drives me crazy!
Erin's POV
Jordan will not stop being adorable.
"Will you please please please just stop, you are killing me." He said while rubbing his face with his hands.
"Same here Jordan, same here." I said
We wanted to edit the video but we couldn't focus on anything but each other.
