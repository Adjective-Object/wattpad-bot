Once I got home, I plopped onto my bed and groaned in frustration. I haven't had to deal with this sort of drama since fourth grade. And in fourth grade it was because a girl accused me of stealing her lunchbox.
There's only one person I could talk to. My best friend Skye.
OOOOk hello. Hope you liked that update cause I'm a pretty sucky writer but hey, I'm working on it. Anyways, I just watched Pitch Perfect 2 and oh my gawd it's hilarious! Also, read "Nameless" by kkausie because damn it's an amazing story! It's not completed but I can tell it's going to be great. Anyways, go and read some other cheesy fanfic or listen to Ed Sheeran. If you do either, I will love you till the ends of time.
