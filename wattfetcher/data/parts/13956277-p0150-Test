He told me about his full plan, we were going to tell the minister himself about this huge company for kidnapping,selling and trading children but after we share these informations on the internet, there was no other way to reach the minister, if we put it on the internet, crowds would stand in lines to know the whole truth and we'd be able to save the girls.
If we shared this story on the internet, they would transfer the girls into another place, and that was why Simon brought Nina's sister, because she knew everything, their communications, the places they hide in, the other similar orphanages and the BOSSES.
"Are you sure you want to be involved in what's going to be a huge disaster ? We may not be safe anymore, they might follow us, chase us and kill us for revenge" I warned Simon, "Did I blink?" He said, "You and I may never get out of this deep water, drowning might become a must to let others float, you might put your family in danger" I wanted him to be aware of what was going to happen, " Why do you want to be part of this then ?" He asked me, Why ? why do I feel a need to save them ? "My parents once told me not to let go of someone who begs for my help" I explained, "They didn't beg" He chuckled, "I could see it in their eyes" I sighed, "Death is a must, but dying to let others live is the best way to say goodbye to this life. If I die trying to let these girls survive, Allah will give me a better life in paradise. Instead of dying in front of a couch and a TV, I want to let go of this life for something worth it" I looked at him seriously, "Well, I've said it before and I'm going to say it again : There is no better way to die than dying for you" He said seriously, "Don't do it for me, do it for you, do it to catch up what you've missed. If you're not doing it for the Ajr to win paradise, do it to have something helpful accomplished in your life" I said, "There's no way back" He said, "I don't want to find the way back, I have already done many disasters. It's time to fix them" I sighed, his eyes went to my belly then back to my eyes, I kept my tears hidden, "It's going to be the biggest scandal this year, we are going to be heroes" He said.
"I want to join too, Tom would love to help us too" Molly suggested, "NO, forget everything we said seconds ago, you are out of this, you got nothing to do with it. We don't need more victims" Simon said angrily and I nodded.
"We should put our personal problems aside if we want to make this thing work" Simon said.
"I have already forgotten everything" I swallowed the lump in my throat.
"You know we're about to suicide, don't you ?" He said then smiled.
"No, I have just got my sole back into my body" I smiled.
