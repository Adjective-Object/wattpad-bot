I am so happy right now knowing that Niall wants to help me end this drama! I CAN'T wait to do what I want to do with Stephanie! I want to KILL her and torture her for making me feel useless and powerless!
My thoughts were interrupted when I heard Niall coughed.
"Sorry to bother Trish but I really need some water or anything liquid that could make me feel a lot more better." He said his voice raspy while scratching his now red neck. "Quit scratching your neck! Here drink this." I said as I passed him a bottle of fresh human blood. I drank one on the way home because I somehow knew that this was gonna happen. "Are you sure about this?" He asked me looking grossed out the fact that he's about to drink some fresh blood. "Yeah go on drink it all, It would make you feel better I promise." I encouraged him.
He looked grossed out at first but when he finally realized that it actually tasted so damn good he finally drank it all! Leaving not even a droplet behind.
"That was so fucking refreshing!" He moaned in delight. "I know right?" I giggled at his reaction as I passed him another bottle of fresh blood.
I can't help but to smile evilly knowing that I finally have someone to help me deal with Harry and Stephanie.
Harry and Stephanie, get ready you mother fucking bastards! There's a huge storm coming your way and you two have no freaking clue about it.
