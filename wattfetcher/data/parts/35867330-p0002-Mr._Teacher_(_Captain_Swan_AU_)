"It's my pleasure, Ms. Swan." They exchanged smiles and Emma turned and left. She felt if she had stayed any longer, she'd have gotten lost in those too blue eyes of his and that wonderful accent. Emma shook her head. She couldn't think like that. This was Henry's teacher. Nothing would happen between them anyway.
