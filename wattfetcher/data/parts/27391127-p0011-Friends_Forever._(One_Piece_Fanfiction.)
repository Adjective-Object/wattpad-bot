"Yohohoho. This is quite interesting."
"Ah too bad. Nami, we need another ball." Luffy shouted.
"No can do. That's why Ace-kun didn't play." Nami stated holding Ace captive by his cheek.
"Eh? Why can't he play?" Luffy asked
"You baka." everyone whispered , their eyes simulation twitching.
"THERE WAS ONLY ONE BALL!!"
Then those few minutes when reality actually dawns on Luffy.
"Eh?"
"BAKA!"
"Its okay guys. I can make a new one." Sakura stated approaching the shore line. She made a regular Sky ball but this time with seawater.
"Here Kid punch this.' Sakura said throwing it to him. He punched it without even looking at it, Sanji kicked it, Zoro sliced it and Luffy punched it back to Sakura and it was still in one piece.
"So cool!" Chopper exclaimed with sparkles.
"It's indestructi." Luffy exclaimed with even more sparkles.
"hm. Let's play."
______________^ And so, A Chopper moment later...^_________
"I can't believe we lost." Sakura stated panting heavily on the ground. The game just ended with a stunning score of 9-10.
"Who wants ice-cream?" Brook asked waving the spoon.
"I want!
"Me too!
"Save some for me!"
"Hey no fair!''
They all got their ice-cream. Aya had vanilla, Haruka had chocolate and Sakura had mint choc chip.
"Hey Luffy watch this." Sakura whispered. She licked a little of her ice-cream and shivered a little which Sanji considered to be cute.
And she exhaled and snowflakes appeared.
"So cool!"You can create snow! So cool, Saki-chan is so cool.!" Luffy awed with sparkles.
"So cool!" Ussop and Chopper awed.
"Damn idiots.'' Kid noted.
"Get used to it." Law answered.
"Sanji-kun! When will we get our food?" Aya asked. There was silence. For once, Sanji did not respond to the voice of a woman and everyone was concerned.
"Sanji-kun didn't answer.'
"What's going on?" Nami asked.
"WHAT THE HELLLLLLLLLLLL??????????!!!!!!!" Sanji screamed from all the way inside of the Sunny's storehouse.
"WHO ATE ALL THE FOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????" Sanji asked surrounded in flames.
*gulp*
"Yosh. Men catch fish for Sanji!" Luffy shouted sitting at the shore with a fishing pole. Usopp, Chopper, Brook and Sakura were there also and they answered with a, "Hai."
Unknownst to everyone, they were all eating some food they found outside the storage room.
"Oi, Luffy." Sanji asked with his only eye twitching. "Where the hell did you get that food?"
"Um, a tanuki went into the storeroom and started to steal the meat...I mean...food and I stopped him..and Brook, Usopp, Chopper and Saki-chan decided to steal the food."
