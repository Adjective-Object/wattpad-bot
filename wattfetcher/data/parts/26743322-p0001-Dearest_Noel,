❝Someone once told me, to be careful when trying to fix a broken person for you may cut yourself on their shattered pieces ❞

Dearest Noel,
You told me to be strong. You told me to be the strong warrior I am. You told me that you'd be there every step of the way.
Through those cold, lonely, sleepless nights when the darkness would consume me, You Noel, you were always there.
You promised.
Why?
Why did you do it?
Why didn't you trust me?
How could I not notice, my dearest Noel. I failed you.
It's all my fault, everything is all my fault. I was too caught up in my darkness and you were too busy trying to pick up my broken pieces.
...But I hadn't noticed that you too, were just as broken...
