Molly POV
Shawn and I have been best friends since kindergarten. We used to trade juice boxes for crayons. Whenever we can we try to hang out because he's on tour right now. Well my life is also busy because I'm Cameron Dallas' little sister so I have to or should I say get to go to a bunch of meet and greets.
Everyone asks me if Shawn and I are dating but I say,"No. He's like a brother to me." I mean he's cute.... I wouldn't mind dating him. But Cameron's really over protective and never would let me date him.
