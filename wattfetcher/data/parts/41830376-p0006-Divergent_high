I open the door slightly and notice something. Luke moved, Oh no. I walk in holding my breath that he isn't here. I glance around the room not seeing a single sight of him. I go up stairs to go to my room, that bench was not good for my back. I open the door and see Luke holding a small pocket knife. It is black leather and then a sliver blade. The blades teeth is are sharp, he slides the steel against his finger tips. He looks at me with fiery in his eyes. "Where were you last night?" He yells."Spending the night at my friends house," I say rolling my eyes. "I didn't agree to that!" He yells and I cringe at his volume. He walks over to me and pins me against the wall. The nob hits the bad part of my back. I clench my teeth at the pain but get through it. He pulls the knife to my neck, I can feel the teeth of the knife on my neck. Why does he just do it! Why doesn't he just kill me already! "If you pull a stunt like that again, this will be in your neck!" He yells at me. I can tell he is drunk by the way he slurs his words. He puts more pressure on the knife and so it goes deeper but not cutting my throat. If he pushes it a little more I would be dead. He finally pulls back. He puts the knife in his right back pocket. He slaps me on the face hard enough to make a tear come down my face. He walks out of my room and I hear him mumbling curse words under my breath. Tears stroll down my face but I wipe them away slowly. This always happens to me, he hurts me like I'm a piece of trash. And I do nothing about it! •••1 month later"So see that brunette over there!" Chros points to a brunette girl, She has blonde tips at the end though. She is tall and has curves. She is pretty tan, she is beautiful. "That is Tobias girlfriend! Sheridan!" She finishes off. I nod my head a little, I could see that. She walks over towards us and smiles. "Hey Chris! Hey letter girl," she says as she walks by. "It is actually number girl but thats close enough!" I yell with a smile. She holds up he middle finger behind her at me. Yep definitely Tobias girlfriend. "She's classy!" I say rolling my eyes. "Yeah she's the head cheerleader!" She says while flipping her hair back a little. "No really!" I say sarcastically. We keep talk for a little bit. Uriah runs up to me and smiles. "You have now been here for month!" Uriah states while picking me up and throwing me over his shoulders. I smile like a goof and kick at him."Set me down!" I say with a laughing. I love this kinda stuff, when we are such close friends. He finally sets me down and I continue to laugh. Why can't everyday be like this.                              •••I walk down the hallway trying to get to the exit door but I can't find it with all the kids in this hallway. I look to my right but all I see is people. I go straight to a wall and wait for everyone to clear out. Once everyone leaves. I start to walk down the hall again and see something. It is Sheridan kissing Tobias I believe. She pulls away for a moment and I realize something. That is not Tobias! My mouth drops open at the sight. She's cheating on him! So many things go through my brain. Should I tell someone? Should I tell him? Should i confront her? I walk away quickly so she doesn't see me staring at her. I run outside and all the buses have left. "No!" I yell while slapping my hand on my head. I still can't get the thought of the cheating out of my head. I feel a slight tap on my shoulder. I whip my head around and see Tobias staring at me. "You need a ride home?" He asks with a stern face. I loom at him and I think of Sheridan. I nod my head a little in agreement. We aren't the closes of friends but we are acquaintances. I follow him to his truck and get in. "You remember where I live?" I question him raising my eyebrows. "Yeah," he sighs a little. On the whole way to my house, I can only think of Sheridan and Tobias. Should I tell him? Should I tell anyone? He drops me off at my house without saying goodbye, Nice. I open the door to see Luke throwing a beer bottle at the wall. "I don't want to see your ugly face tonight!" He yells. I get scared at his volume and slam the door behind me. I can hear a beer bottle hit the door. I take in a deep breath in the outside air. I'm happy I don't have to see him again. I pull out my phone and call Chris. "Hey what's up?" Chris says."I was wondering if I can spend the night at your house?" I ask politely. "Yeah thats fine!" "Can I be there in 5?" "Yeah! See you then!" She hangs up the phone. I run to her house for 2 reasons. 1. To get some Cardio up. 2. I said i would be there in 5 minutes. I finally see her house and i knock on the door. "Hey Six!" Uriah says as he opens the door. I smile and walk in noticing everyone is in there normal spot. I sit in my red bean bag chair. I already know we are going to do truth or dare. Everyone thinks that something is wrong with me, like something is wrong. There is something wrong! I can't get the image out of my head. Sheridan. In the next 15 minutes I'm asked so many things about my name or what I'm hiding. I have taken off my coat and now I'm wearing a sweater. "Tris!" Chris says. "Truth!" I reply quickly. "What is the secret your hiding!" She says while slapping her hands on her lap. I can't pass this time because if I do, everyone will see the scars on my arms. "Umm someone I know is cheating on someone else!" I say quietly. "Who?" Uriah asks quickly. I mumble Sheridan's his name silently. Nobody hears me and asks me to speak up. "Sheridan," I say with my eyes closed. I don't want to see Tobias face. I finally open my eyes to see him right in front of me. I open my eyes and see him kneeling in front of me. He holds a cup of water and throws it in my face. I knew I saw that coming! He walks out of the room. I should've went to the bench instead of here! I run after Tobias but by the time I get outside. His car is gone.
