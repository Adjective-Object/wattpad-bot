I wake up with a head splitting headache. What happened?? As soon as the thought hit my mind it all came back to me.**FLASHBACK**Right as I was about to speak my father burst into the room.. "You attention seeking whore, tried to take your own life. Well it didn't work, but you will be dead soon."
Before I could say anything my father was on top of me beating me. I knew I was going to black out. The doctors tried to pull him off, but he was too strong. Before I blacked out I saw five figures walk into the room and pull my dad off me like it was nothing...**END OF FLASHBACK**Who were those people who saved me??By now I could feel my ribs hurting more than ever. I tried to get up but I couldn't move my leg. I looked down at my leg and saw a lime green cast, it already had signatures on it. Who would sign my cast??I looked closer at my cast to see five very familer signatures. My mind went into complete fangirl mode.
"OH MY GAWD BVB SIGNED MY CAST!!!" I screamed a little loud.
Wait how did BVB sign my cast...
My thoughts were soon inturrupted by my doctor walking into the room with a grin on his face, "I see your awake now, I have a suprise for you."
His grin widened even more.
"First I have a question." The doctor nodded so I continued, "Actually two questions. First, what happened to my d-dad after I passed out? Second, how do I have the signatures of BVB!?"
His grin turned into a smile when I said BVB.
"That is my suprise. You see we watched your video, and I know the band because my daughter loves them. I know thay always love to meet fana, and love to help out when they can. Well, I told them about your situation, and they decieded.. they are going to adopt you."
I was speechless. Black Veil Brides adopting a nobody like me?
"You can leave today and they already have your stuff at their house. So when your ready you can leave."
"I would like to go now please." I said trying to keep my cool.
Next thing I know I am in the back of their car sitting on Andy's lap, with CC making faces at us.
"You're really beautiful, you know that.." Andy whispered only loud enough for me to hear.
