"What you writing in there?" Minnie asked thoughtfully as she finished off the cold smoothie. Flix put it back in her shoulder bag and closed it off with the zipper.
"'Been writing a little story so every time a thought come I jot it down so I don't forget. Though I haven't actually started it yet, I want to work out the details first."
"Cool." Flix took another sip finishing off hers as she got up from the stool.
"Wanna go up stairs I wanna show you something." she shouldered her bag and stated to walk when Minnie followed her up taking the stairs two at the time. Her bedroom was on the left, her door covered in pictures and stickers. Flix opened it up and went inside. Normally people would think she had a messy room because her bag was such a mess however it was the complete opposite. Dirty cloths where piled in a laundry basket and books lined clean shelves on her walls. a desk sat in the corners piled with layers of drawings and  papers from school.
"Wow I thought your room was always a mess."
"Nah sometimes I will mess it up for fun because my mom thinks I'm too clean like I'm hiding something." Flix snorted as she set her bag on a blue chair in the corner. Posters covered the wall and a corner in the back were smothered in pictures of the past years.
