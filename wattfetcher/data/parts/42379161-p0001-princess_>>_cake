OKAY I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THIS IS MY FIRST CAKE STORY, OKAY I USUALLY DONT DO BROMANCES BUT SHIT I LIKE THEM OKAY SO YEAH
therefore, if you do not like it, thinks it's wrong, or have any problems with what I write, then one, why the fuck did you click on my story for? and two, get the hell ova it and chill dude.
ps, it's a little different from most fics, it has texting log chapters, and chapters written like any other fanfiction. so yes, some chapters might be shorter due to it being from text. but I think you'll enjoy. once again, don't be so quick to judge. every fanfiction has a boring start or point.
NOW, for all the cake ladies, enjoy (!!!)
