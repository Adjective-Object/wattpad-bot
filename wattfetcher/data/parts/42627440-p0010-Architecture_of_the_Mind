Let me tell you a story, as the receding coastline starts to bleed
Starlight bounded, it was holding, the suppressed memories
Somehow they are kept, by some undefined measure, hidden by invisible work
Unknown to the eye, or the feeble human, can you awake a stream?
Defined, it is numb, felt it is hell
This is how a body temporarily dies
It's a treacherous process, brewed for a year, two or three
But its impact is damaging to the heart and mind
Tell a soul, abandoned at birth, that you admire it
Explain to that fragile yet strong light of why you cannot go near it
Trust that it will crave your warmth; eager to be embraced by something it is missing
Hold it, tightly now, it might scare and dissolve away
This is how you keep it, kill it
Promise that you love it
Draw the constellations of it on your arms, heart and your brain
Promise that light what every human fights for, dies for and breathes for
Love, the element that's intangibly tangible
Nurture this thought to the light, it will drain you quickly
This promise is as solid as vapor
Now, beat the light, keep it between your fingers and shake it
Squeeze the tiny thing, watching it scream and cry
Writhing in confusion, upset and doubt
Starve the light, scar the light, wound the light so that small corked core is severed
Can I tell you the story, the end as the coastline stops to bleed?
Sunlight awakened, spreading softly, reminding the mind of the misplaced
Remember the light, you pretended to love, memorize every particle and shade
Drop it into the abyss; watch it dim and go out
However, do not be a fool nor forget
The universe was created by accident, by monsters like you
Who knows how to hold light between a deity's fingers?
That light is matter, neither created nor destroyed.
