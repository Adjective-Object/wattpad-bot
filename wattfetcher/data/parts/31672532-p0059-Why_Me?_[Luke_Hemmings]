"This looks great Alex!" Mom compliments me.
"I learn from the best!" I beam a smile and we dig in with our hungry bellies.

After updating my parents on the latest news of school, boys, and friends I head to my bathroom for a shower.
My ten minute shower was refreshing and much needed. I head back to my room and see I have a text from Luke but I change into my pajamas first.
Luke: Hey after school tomorrow wanna come over? I kinda wanna talk about something
Alex: sure yeah oh and mom said hi!
Luke: awesome and tell her I said hi! :)
Alex: okie dokie! Goodnight Luke :)
Luke: goodnight gorgeous :) x
With that I plugged my phone in to charge and nuzzled into my covers and turned the lamp off. I look up through the ceiling window and see the stars, drifting to sleep knowing that I can make myself and many others just as happy as me.
