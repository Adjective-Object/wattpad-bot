I make my way back toward the elevator, I open the second file and stop myself, even though I probably looked weird at the moment. Shock was clearly evident in my face.
I was about to go into that elevator when, I realized that the other patient is on the same floor!!
Ok, so I was a bit dramatic, but I was bored and I wanted to test my dramatic skills.
I head back down the hallway to the other patient's room. It's a guy named Noah who is seventeen, a senior and probably is in my school. I come up to his room and knock on the door. I don't hear a proper response, only a grunt which made me hesitate before opening the door.
