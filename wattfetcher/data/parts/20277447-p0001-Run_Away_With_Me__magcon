Chapter 1 | This is Me
Camille's POV
"And I was enchanted to meet you,
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you-oou. This love is sparkling don't you let it go, I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home, I'll spend forever, wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you-oo-oo-oo-oou." I finished singing. "Thank you guys for watching! Please like and subscribe for more covers every week!" I finished recording my video and went to upload it to my computer so I could edit. I had finally started to live my dreams. I had 1.9 million subscribers on YouTube and my twitter feed was blowing up. I decided that tomorrow I'd have to do an #AskCamille. "Cameron! I'm done filming! You can come in now!" I had lived in the US since I was 10. So about 6 years now. I ran away from my life in Australia after the one and only Luke Hemmings broke my heart. Yes, young love. Before we went out, we were best friends. He was 1 year older than me, but it was like he was my knight in shining armor. You know, they guard the princesses. After that I went to try and find my dad in the US. He left when I was 7 and lived in Cali. I couldn't find him, but found Cam. Cameron Dallas, my brother by adoption. He made my life perfect and helped me chase my dreams. Now it's 2014. In April 2013 I had 1k subscribers on YouTube and now I had nearly 2 million! Thanks to Cam. Everyone knew Cam's family adopted me. We answered that question in one of our first #AskCamAndCamille 's. Living with another famous person is really fun. See Cameron helped me with everything. School, music, hate, my memories of Luke. He was my best friend. Cam got to our studio. "Ready to film my video Cami?" "Yep!" "How's this tweet sound: @camerondallas: making a new #AskCamAndCamille with the one and only, @CamiDallasxoxo ! Tweet us some questions!" "Perfect!" "You tweeting too?" "Yep! How's this sound: @CamiDallasxoxo: @camerondallas and I are filming a new #AskCamAndCamille vid for Cam's channel!!!!!! Tweet us some q's!" "Great!" "And the questions are rolling in!" "Let's get started!"
