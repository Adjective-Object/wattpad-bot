~~Miracle~~
Me and Taylor was looking into each others eyes when out of no where she kissed me at first I hesitated to kiss back but I did after a while she licked my bottom lip asking for a entrance and that's when I pulled away.
Taylor----- M-miracle I'm sorry
Miracle----- Ummm it's ok
Taylor----- Well its getting pretty late I think I should go
Miracle----- k..... see you later
And with that she left..... I wanted her to stay and be mine but I barley know her and I don't think I can risk getting my heart broken again I just wasn't ready I wasn't in the mood for tv so I went upstairs and went to sleep.
