Jasmine's POV 7:00amI woke up by a hurtful stinging on my right thigh and right away I knew it was my dad that just hit me with a belt"Get up you ugly bitch"he said in a rough and mean voice😡he left and I got up I literally have to deal with this every single day and it hurts that no one cares about me but my big sister Brittany.Right now she's working she always gets up early in the morning to go to work,but my sister never got bullied at school and she never gets beaten by my dad or mom and that's sucks cause I do.right now I am looking through my drawers trying to decide on what to wear I finally chose what to wear(light blue skinny jeans and a blue long sleeve shirt with my black vans and a black hoodie)I walked in my bathroom and put on mascara and lipgloss and for my hair I just left it natural I walked downstairs and my dad left for work but my mom was in the kitchen making herself breakfast "Ugh what do you want because I'm not making you breakfasts" she said in disgust😁"I just came down to get a granola bar and to go to school" I said "Well hurry the fuck up and leave because I don't want to see your ugly ass face"she said yelling at meI got a granola bar and a water bottle and it was 7:50 when I left.
