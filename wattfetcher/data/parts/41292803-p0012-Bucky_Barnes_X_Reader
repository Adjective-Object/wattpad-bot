I was awakened by the noise of moaning and heart shattering pleas.

Please! No! No! Don't wipe me! Please! I will do anything! I need them! I need her! Please! No!

I rushed over to Bucky and shook him gently. Both of his hands shot out and captured my wrists. He held them tightly in his steel grip. He squeezed tighter and tighter. I knew that if he didn't wake up, he would snap my wrists.

Bucky! Bucky! Wake up! Please wake up!

Finally, his eyes flew open. He let go of my wrists and breathed heavily. He was drenched in sweat and his eyes had dark circles underneath them.

Its ok. It was just a dream. Go back to sleep.

Bucky's eyes slid shut at my command. I knew he probably wouldn't remember this. My wrists throbbed. I rolled back into bed and hoped Bucky wouldn't see them.

I woke up a few hours later and slid out of bed. I peaked at my wrists. The flesh was swollen and discolored. I sighed and pulled my long sleeves down to cover them. I stretched and let out a groan.

What's wrong? Bucky asked.

My neck and shoulders hurt so bad from all that training.

Bucky walked silently over and began to massage my neck and shoulders.

Mhmmmmm.Â That feels so good. I said.

After about ten minutes, we went to work. I was going to learn some more complex moves this time. After about an hour, we did a tough move. I stood in position, but Bucky came over and moved my wrists up. I winced slightly. Bucky noticed.

What's wrong? Did I hurt you?

No. I said immediately.

I quickly put my hands behind my back. Bucky held a hand out expectantly. I shook my head. He stared at me for a long time, then with a shrug, he said,

If you don't want to show me I wont force you.

Immediately I relaxed. It was a bad choice. Bucky lunged and grabbed my hand, pulling down my sleeve.

Why would you do something like that?! I yelled.

Bucky was too busy staring at my wrist to reply. He gently touched it and a small groan escaped my lips. His eyes widened.

Last night. I remember. My hands were cramped from squeezing something. It must have been your wrist. Oh my gosh! I am so sorry.

Bucky. It is ok. I am going to be fine. It wasn't your fault. You were asleep.

I was suddenly grabbed around the waist and pulled into a huge hug.

You smell good. Bucky said.

Liar!

I then playfully smacked his hand and we both began play fighting. I smiled and he smiled back. He looked so happy, and I was proud to be a part of it.
