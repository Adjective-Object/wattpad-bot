***"Amelia come on! I'm sure you look fine!" I yell through the bathroom door. Amelia and I were getting ready for the Kiss On The Lips party at her loft. The limo we were sharing with Chuck, Blair, her minions, and Nate was gonna pick us up any minute. "I look stupid!" Amelia yells back. I roll my eyes and bang on the door some more. "Okay! Okay! Calm down! I'm coming!" She shouts. I smirk and sit on her bed waiting for her to come out. She walks out looking absolutely gorgeous. "Melia! You look amazing!" I squeal jumping up and hugging her. "Okay! Okay! Just stop crushing me, please." She says causing me to pull away from her. "I can't believe I agreed to go to this thing." Amelia mumbles. I open my mouth to say something but get cut off by a knock at the door. "I'll get it." I mumble and walk to the door. I open the door to see Nate and Chuck messing around as they wait for us.  "Idiots." I mumble laughing causing they to stop and turn to me with a smile. "Amelia let's go!" I shout, grabbing my clutch. "Shall we?" Chuck asks holding his hand out. I roll my eyes and laugh at my best friend. "We shall." I say and take his hand. We walk to the limo while Nate waits for Amelia. Chuck opens the limo door letting me in first. "What a gentleman." I say with a laugh, as he smiles. "Madi! You look gorgeous!" Blair squeals hugging me tightly. "So do you B!" I say as I  pull away from the hug. Chuck sits next to me. Amelia and Nate get in and we speed off. Blair hands me and Amelia a glass of champagne. "Oh I don't dri-" Amelia starts. "Tonight you do." I inform her with a smirk. She shrugs and starts drinking the champagne. We all cheer with smiles as we chug down our champagne. After about four glasses of champagne Amelia is sort of drunk. She stands up and looks out the sun roof. "Best! Night! Ever!" She shouts with a champagne bottle in her hand. I laugh with Chuck as the other talk. Soon enough we get to the party. Chuck gets out and helps me and Amelia out. "Come one let's go!" Amelia says and runs off. "Oh great. I'll be back. If Blair asks say I'm looking for Amelia." I say and he nods in response. "Thanks you're the best." I say and kiss his cheek before running after Amelia.
***Looks like little J will end up with a new boy and a ticket to the inner circle. Or will C end up with another victim? I told you I love parties.
***I finally found Amelia and I was taking her out for some fresh air. "Come on. Okay. No more champagne for you." I mumble as I help her outside. "You're right this is amazing!" Melia shouts as she spins around. "Do you have more to drink?" I ask looking at her confused. "It is possible that Chuck found me and offered me a happy drink." She says as she giggles. "That basshole." I say as I roll my eyes. "Oh shut up! You know you have a crush on him!" Melia teases causing me to furrow my eyebrows. "Yeah, because I would be into my best friend who is a man whore, right?" I ask sarcastically. "I guess you are." She says confused. "Okay we'll you stay out here and sober up while I go inside and tell Blair we are leaving early." I say as I sit her against a wall. "Yes ma'am." She says as she giggles. I roll my eyes and walk back inside.
Amelia's .p.o.v.
I look around as I lean against the wall Madi put me against. I was starting to sober up so I stood up and decided to see what was taking her so long. "Hey! Amelia!" I hear a sort of familiar voice ask. I turn to face a cute boy that used to be one of my closest friends. "Dan! What are you doing here?" I slur more than asking. "Jenny is in trouble with some guy named Chuck. Have you seen her?" He asks looking worried. "No I haven't but come on I'll help." I say more than offering. "No. It's okay." He tries assure me. "No its not. Nothing with that basshole is okay." I say and grab his hand, dragging him inside. "Okay I'm gonna do a lap. Look for her." He says and I nod. He runs off as I look around. I start walking around but see no sign of Jenny. I stop at the bar, where Dan finds me. "Hey. Any luck?" I ask looking at his worried expression. "No. I haven't seen her anywhere." He replies still looking around. "Come on let's check upstairs." I suggest and he nods. "All right." He says and follows me on my way up the stairs. We start running upstairs and still no sign of Chuck or Jenny. "There isn't gonna be anybody up here. This is pointless." Dan sighs as soon as I see Chuck's scarf. "Dan! That's Chuck's scarf." I say as I start running. We open the door to the roof and see Chuck holding her down and kissing her neck. "Hey! Jenny!" Dan yells. "Chuck get off of her!" I shout. Chuck let's her go and she runs to Dan. "Are you okay?" I ask and she nods as Dan hands her to me. "Thanks Melia." She says with a smile. "Wow you actually remember me." I say with a chuckle. "Of course I do. Dan was in love with you." She chuckles causing me to smile. Dan punches Chuck and I hand Jenny back to him. "Chuck don't you ever touch her again!" I shout and push him causing him to fall to the ground. "Come on Amelia! Don't be like that! You were having fun!" Chuck say as he dusts his suit off. I roll my eyes and we all three leave. We walk through the party and outside where a cab is waiting for us. He puts Jenny in the cab and he turns to me with a smile. "So think I got a shot at a date?" He asks boldly causing me to smile. "Hell yeah, Humphrey." I say causing him to chuckle as he gets in the cab. I smile as the cab drives away. "Melia! There you are! Where were you?!" Madi asks worried as she rushes to my side. "I'll explain at home." I say as her limo pulls up next to us. "My place or your place tonight?" She asks as I get into the limo. "My place. Mom made some pie." I say causing her to laugh while she sits next to me and we speed off.
