A girl named Hailey lived in a little white house with her mom and dad. She had blonde and pink hair with brown eyes.Her parents always wished that the other would die.So one day Hailey came home from school and police cars and ambulances surrounded her house. They were pulling out a stretcher that had her mom on it. "What is wrong with my mom." Hailey cried. "Dont worry about it" The police officer said. Hailey fell to the ground crying and pulling her hair. Hailey felt like her life was over. She is only 14 with no mom. She ran inside and couldnt find her dad anywhere. So she packed up all her stuff and sat outside. This boy walked by and noticed she was crying. He ran over to her and said "Hello, My name is Ash." "Hi, I am Hailey." Hailey said. Ash said worried "Why are you crying" "My dad killed my mom, and ran away so i have no one." Hailey said. "Come with me to my house so you can meet my mom and see if you can live there with me and her."Ash said. "Okay!" Hailey said really happy.
