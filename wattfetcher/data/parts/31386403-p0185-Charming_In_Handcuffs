"Not yet."
And that was all we talked about Jack.
We were in the middle of cleaning up the kitchen when my phone buzzed in my pocket. I dropped the dishtowel and pulled my phone from my pocket. I didn't even bother checking the name of the person who was calling and answered it. "Hello?"
"Juliet." Marie spoke, "I wanted to let you know he woke up about an hour ago."
I closed my eyes and breathed a sigh of relief, "How is he?"
"He's okay. He's asking for you."
"Can I come visit?"
"Of course. I'll see you in a few."
I mumbled a thank you and hung up. I told my grandma I was going to the hospital to visit Jack and left. I pulled out of the driveway and headed towards the hospital. I was a little nervous and excited. He was okay and he's going to be okay even after this.
I parked the car and jogged up to the hospital entrance. I asked the lady at the front desk which room he was in and she pointed me to the third floor, room 312. I took the elevator up to the third floor and tried to slow down while searching for the room number.
I turned two more corners and his room was at the end of the hall. His mom was leaning over the nurse's station and Jack Sr. was standing next to her while they talked to the nurse. Marie was the first one to see me and she wrapped her arms around me before I could get a word out, "Thank you for coming."
I couldn't help but smile as I stepped back, "Is it okay to go in?"
"It'll get him to smile at least." She teased.
It wasn't really hard to get Jack to smile.
I walked across the small hall and touched the handle to Jack's room. I pushed down, pushed the door open, and slid inside.
