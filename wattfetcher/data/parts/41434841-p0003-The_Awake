I feel... Guilty. I feel guilty because I'm not sad. I know it sounds strange but I can't help it. I feel like I shouldn't be happy, like it goes against everything. But I like it. I feel alive. I'm sure I'll say that 30,000 more times but I don't really care. I can think. I can feel. I am alive. My fog is gone. I can't change anything that I've done and I can't correct the past but right now I just need to figure out myself. I've come to terms with "Ashton". I am Ashton. Ashton is me. Ashton isn't just a feeling or a cover. I am transgender. No, my body isn't exactly "correct" but I can get there eventually. I am a boy. (A boy who likes to wear makeup sometimes but there's nothing wrong with that). For a really long time I felt like Ashton was wrong, I felt like being //me// was wrong. I can't deny who I am. Even if I wanted to. No amount of praying to a god can change me. I was created to be this way. I may have trouble finding a name that sticks but that's just a minor issue. So far I'm Ashton Cyrus Turner and I love it. I love it so much. I love me. God that feels weird to say. Just. I. Love. Me. I love myself. I love who I could be. I love all the possibilities. I love it. I could be a king. I AM A KING. Of memes that is.. But a king nonetheless. I guess that's kind of it. I just wanted to make note of the fact that I can love myself.
