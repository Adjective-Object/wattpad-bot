The club Meredith was talking about wasn't too far into the city. It was one I've always seen, never paid much attention to it. It lit up in a bright red, it was hard to miss. It was also hard to find decent parking. I was really happy I decided to wear flat shoes than heels. I wouldn't have survived this night. I've never heard Lindy complain though.
We walked for a bit until we reached the end of the line. It was moving quickly until we were up next. They didn't ask for ID. Meredith simply gave her name and they let us in. They stopped us to give us bright green wristbands and then we went inside.
It was loud.
Maybe that's an understatement.
The club was two levels as far as I could tell. I turned around in a circle, trying to get a good visual of it. There were flashing lights, loud music, and hundreds of people dancing in front of me.
"There he is!" Meredith pointed and waved.
I look to her line of sight and I shouldn't be surprised.
Paxton of course.
Yep, not surprised.

Eh, guess not that emotionally heavy, haha. And of course, it's Paxton, who else would it be? hahahaha.
It would be awesome if you guys could tell me how the story's going? Like too slow, or fast, want more chapters in Jack's point of view, etc. Nothing harsh please, lol.
Also, yay me for updating three days in a row! :)
