Ana Buddy: it's pretty much this person you can talk to. like about your feelings and stuff. they also help you keep losing weight. like make sure you don't eat a lot and exercise a lot.
Mia: this is the voice that gets you to eat and stuff. pretty much the "bad" voice in your head. (If your anorexic )
Mia ( bulimia pro-Mia )
Ana ( anorexic pro-Ana )
Ana tells you everything when your anorexic and Mia does when your bulimic.
Really bad description just look it up.
