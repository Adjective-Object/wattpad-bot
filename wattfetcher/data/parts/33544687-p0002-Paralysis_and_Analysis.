Minute pass. Minute pass. Gosh, pass!
Suddenly time seemed to stop and the one minute seemed to be like twelve minutes.
"Ring. Ring. Ring."
The bell rang and the teacher dismissed everyone.
All the students got up from their seats, and in a second, were zooming speedily out of the door.
Grabbing her jacket from her locker she closed it and went downstairs to collect her cheesecake she had made in the morning, since she had double tech and was in year 8.
Holding the cheesecake carefully she walked outside of the front door and started to walk. Lucille ran up to her and swept her honey blonde hair from her shoulder.
"Nice cake. Brill. Can I try it?" She teased, her bluey-reddish eyes glinting with good natured humour.
"No, I poisoned it," Jamie deadpanned. "What? Aww, why?" She pouted.
Jamie crossed her arms and looked up at her with a stern look. "Honestly, why weren't we comedians?" She questioned.
All Jamie got was a halfhearted shrug. "I dunno. We should be; we make everyone, and I mean everyone, laugh!"
A vroom! was sounded near the distance and both Jamie and Lucille pivoted to see where it was emanating from.
A black car was sitting neatly near the paved road and was slightly surrounded by shrubs and bushes.
There was a occult emblem imbibed on its trunk and no one was in it.
The emblem was of an animal, perhaps a hybrid of Medusa and a Minotaur.
The animal emblem was intertwined with a sword. The strange thing was that they were moving, and the animal seemed paralysed with fear from the sword.
The sword jerked its head at the animal and pointed its head at the animals heart.
Jamie sent a look at Lucille. Lucille just shrugged herself and waved a hand dismissively and started to chat once again.
Jamie looked back and nibbled her bottom lip. She shook her head, adjusted her thoughts, and listened to Lucille.
It's just a symbol. It doesn't mean anything. Leave it Jamie, you're acting like you want to know what it is about.
Despite Lucille gossiping happily, Jamie couldn't fight the urge of curiosity of the symbol. It was on her mind constantly.
