"Last I remember, I was in the locker room talking to Demi and then from there, nothing," He said as he kept the eyes on the nurse. She looked over at me, quickly, and then back at Nick.
"I am just going to go call the doctor real fast, and have him come in here," she said as she walked out of the room to page the doctor. I followed her closely behind.
"Is he going to be ok?" I asked a little worried now.
"I just am going to give the doctor a quick call, so he can do his examination," She said, not really answering my question.
"Demi? Is everything ok?" Carter asked as he quickly came walking up. I looked around the hallway, looking for Jay or Alvey, but I couldn't see them, so I looked back up at Carter.
"I dont know.. something is off. He doesn't remember anything, Carter. He only remembers talking to me in the locker room. That means he doesn't remember me telling him I love him, or what Wilmer did to him," I tried to explain to Carter.
"Why don't you tell him?" Carter asked me.
"Because I don't want to say it again. I want his memories to come back on his own," I tried explaining to Carter, but he didn't seem to really understand. Just then I saw the Doctor enter Nick's room. "Hey, I am going to go listen, I will be back," I said to Carter, and then quickly ran inside the room to hear what the Doctor was saying to Nick.
"Ok Nick, so what it looks like, is right now, with all that swelling in the brain, it's causing you to suppress some of your short term memories. Once the swelling goes down, your memories should start to flood in," the Doctor explained to both, Nick and I. We both just nodded our heads and then both stared over at each other.  I know NIck was dying for answers, but I wasn't ready to give them to him. I wanted him to remember on his own. My only question is, what happens if those memories never return? Then what?
