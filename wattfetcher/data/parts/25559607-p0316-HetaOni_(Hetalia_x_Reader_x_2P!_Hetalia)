///Third Person PoV///



"America~! If you don't come out soon, you'll get hot flashes~" Italy told his American friend. They were inside the bathroom. Italy was able to finish bathing before America did, so Italy waited outside his friend's cubicle.


After a moment of silence between them, America spoke, "Hey, Italy can I ask you something about the early time loops?"



"What? Y-yeah, sure..." Italy answered uncertainly.



America lowered his voice a bit.  "Was there a time when only England died?"



"-Yes, there was. Since he's really powerful, he would do all he could, but there was a time when he used too much power. And then..." the Italian trailed off.



Furrowing his brows, America asked, "And even then, you went back in time?"



"Yes, because my goal was to get everyone to escape. I couldn't lose a single one of you." Italy told him.



Upon hearing that, America's eyes widened. "Why did you go back? You hate England, don't you? Why would you go back for someone you hate? Not only England. You're afraid of Russia, too. You went through a lot in the past, didn't you? Why would you go so far for their sake-"



"Oh, come to think of it...I think I hardly feel hatred for them." Italy said, shaking his head.



"What?"



"I may often find them unlikable, or scary or unpleasant, but I can't say I've even really hated them. So, even though I often find then scary or unpleasant, I don't hate them."



"Even if we can all get out of here, I'm sure one day you'll have a fight with one of us." America said in a depressed tone.
