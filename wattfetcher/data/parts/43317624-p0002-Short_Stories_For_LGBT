I turned back around to catch his expression, I didn't exactly know why he amused me so much. Hey he said his voice deep and low. Hey. I replied my voice sounding light in comparison. You and Monica okay? I haven't seen y'all together as usual. He asked waiting for me to continue the conversation. I was honestly taken back by his question.
I didn't think he knew nor anyone about Monica and I relationship. We'd always kept it on the down low to avoid drama. Are you stalking me? I asked still lost on how he knew. His face grew red and I started to feel like I'd said something wrong.  His embarrassment made me  flustered and I blushed also.
What was happening? No you guys just always seemed close and now ur suddenly just by yourself. Going back to being your quiet self as before. I stared at him trying to think of what I was Bout to say. Monica cheated on me. Well no we broke up. It was just ugh mutual I guess.
I said without caring who heard. Adrens eyes got big. Surprises! Surprises I thought u guys where just friends but to find out y'all were even more than that. Shake my head well at times like these looks like you could use a friend. He said seeming exciting about hearing my new relationship status.
A friend? And what makes you think I need a friend? Or better yet that I'd want you as one? I asked sounding more harsh than neede d. But Adren didn't seem to get the point becaspuse the next things that flew out his mouth was, Yeah, a friend and u need one. So how about we go to my house tonight and play games and watch some vids?
He suggested. The idea sounded so kiddy but I needed to be out. Bad.  Videos must mean porn. He wants me to watch porn with him. Well I haven't been getting anyway, plus what's the problem we're both guys. Its harmless.
