Chapter 7
When I woke up, I went out and apparently Jacob, Bella, and I are the last ones. I had to figure out how to survive. Then a canon went off and it was a picture of Jacob. I was thinking at that exact moment I was thinking that I was going to die for sure. See Bella is a very strong women. I knew that I most likely wasn't going to survive. I was determined to win though. Nothing could stop me. So thats what I did I believed and became determined. I went in the middle of the dome and yelled, "Oh Bella!" Then I heard from the other side of the field, "What do you want?" Then I shoot an arrow right at her. She dodged it. Of course. She came running after me. I was scared but I kept that determination. While she was chasing me I shot another arrow and got her leg. She screamed in agony. I was winning but not for long she tackeled me and was choking a grabbed an arrow and put right in the stomach. She ended up bleeding to death. I have survived the Legendary Fights..
