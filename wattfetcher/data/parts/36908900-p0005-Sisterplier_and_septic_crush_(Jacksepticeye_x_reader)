Y/n's POV
I woke up in a unfamiliar place I look around and see... crap! "Jack.." I swallow the lump in my throat... I shake Jack... "hmmm" he mumbles "Wake up..." i shake him faster, he shoots up "Y/n!! Fuck Mark is gonna fuck me up!!" He whisper yells.
____A drive to mark's place____
I knock on the door quietly hoping and praying mark isn't up... but to my luck he is up... the door opens so fast, just like how my heart speeds up. "Where the fuck were you!" mark yells i look down "At Jack's..." I whispered "Speak up please y/n" i can hear the anger in his voice, i hear Jack's car door open and close "She was at my place, i'm sorry Mark!" Jack shouts over his car afraid of what Mark will do. He furrows his brows "I-i am sorry Mark" I say as he walks me inside "I didn't mean too, i mean it's partly your fault leaving me with Jack and then-" Mark cuts me off "Maybe your right "he shrugs" maybe i shouldn't have introduced you to him." i look at him "No! You can't treating me like this right now it's unfair!" i yell tears surround my eyes "Stop being chilldish i can talk and sleep at his house if i want!" i yell "Yes i guess you can y/n cause i'm not stopping you..." Mark walked into his office i fell to the floor crying.
____Half an hour of crying____
"Mark...Mark" i say coming out of my room. I look around the house looking for him, once i get to the living area, Someone possibly mark walks through the door... "Mark, look i am sorry about earlier today" he grabs me roughly "Mark?" i look up "You're not mark!?" he smiles "Hell No i ain't" he knocks me out clean with a punch and i know i am being dragged out....
