Scorpio's are intense people but some of the most loving and loyal people around. They need a lot of stability and someone they can rely on who is just as loyal and protective as they are. And not just for a little while, for the long haul. When dealing with a Scorpio, understanding that they will be up and down with their emotions, especially if they care about you. They can be jealous and possessive but that's because what's theirs is theirs. If they've invested the time, they want to shout to the world "he/she's mine". And if they need some space, give it to them Â . . . . I'ts necessary.
