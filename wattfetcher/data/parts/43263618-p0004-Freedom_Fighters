"My name is Eren." He replied. I nodded and looked up at him, "What are these things attacking our village?"
He opened his mouth to talk, "These things? They are titans." He replied, and I nodded. "But why now? Where did the big pink one come from?" I asked tilting my head.
"That's what I'm trying to figure out." I nodded and started to think for a bit.
'Oh crap! I forgot about the gang! What am I supposed to do?' I thought to myself.
"C'mon, lets get to the boats." Eren said, grabbing my wrist running through the chaos.
When we reached the boats, I let out a sigh of relief when I saw the gang.
Eren and I got on the boats, as soon as he let me go I started running to my friends.
"Guys!" I shouted, getting their attention. "Sketch! We thought you died or something." Andy says awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.
'Wow, thanks for believing I can make it.' I say to him in mind.
"Well, I would've been dead, if it wasn't for this guy." I grabbed Eren's wrist, pulling him in front of the gang. "Thank you for saving our friend!" Flo said, and Eren nodded. "You're welcome." He says, and walks off to hi two friends. The blonde boy Armin, and the girl most of the little boys fear, Mikasa.
I walked to the edge of the boat and said my goodbyes to my home.
"Don't worry mom, dad, big bro, I'll free us all. I will fight for our freedom." I muttered those words before walking back to the gang.
And that is how the Freedom Fighters was born.
