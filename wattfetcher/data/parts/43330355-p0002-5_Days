TUESDAY another day ready to get beat up at school hit by parents and dumped in a gutter full of rats wich they can then hopefully eat me up alive while I'm still breathing so then I can just end all this pain and suffering "I don't want this anymore I said as I layed there in my horrible grotty old room, full of wripped wallpaper, pulled up green carpet and a leak in the roof "ANNA GET YOUR LAZY ASS OUT OF BED YOU SON OF A BITCH!" my dad (Josh) burst into my room and took of his belt attached to his pants "get..*hit*..up..*hit*..now..*hit*!" he screamed at me whilst whipping me on my ass with his belt. My mum (Vanessa) came up and dragged me outside to her car she decided to drop me off today, because she wanted some time to give me a real punishment on her own without my father being there. "GET IN THE CAR BITCH!" she yelled I did and she got in with me, she then pulled something out from her purse it was a whip "bend over" I looked at her with fear "BEND OVER!" I did and she laughed seeing the marks my dad had made with his belt "haha seems your dad already beat me to it...but that doesn't mean you don't get it honey." she whisperd in my ear as she hit me over and over again...We arrived at school, she literally pushed me out of the car door and onto the streets where infront of me stood Billy Corban, the meanest kid in school "aww look what we have here I tried to get up but he pinnede down and got on top of me "go at her boys" he got all his other friends to get knifes and start to cut me in different places ony body I burst into tears when I got home maybe I can hmmm......
