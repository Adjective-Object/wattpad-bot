"Hey whatcha doing?" Riley asked, "I have to tell you something." I said, "What?" She asked
"I'm leaving on tour for two months with them." I said, "Oh, your coming back right." she said, "Okay, as long as you aren't moving then I'm good." she said I nodded.
"Hey...Can I talk to you?" Hayes asked me, I looked at Riley to leave. "What?" I asked, I'm so sorry of what happened with the whole snappy thing and us not acting how we're supposed to." he said, "Its uh, it's fine." I looked down.
"Oh okay, can we at least try to be friends?" He asked I nodded, "Lets start over...Hi I'm Keegan." I smiled, "Hello...I'm Hayes." he tackled me down hugging me, "Ha ha- Hayes stop!" I screamed as he tickled me, "Aww!" Nash, Cameron, and Riley said in unison.
"Shut up Dallas, Grier, Espinosa!" Hayes and I said in unison, He helped me up. "Get some rest please we have a big day tomorrow." Cameron said I quickly took a shower.

"Goodnight, Grier's Dallas Espinosa!" I yelled, "Goodnight Dallas's Grier's and me!" Riley yelled, "Goodnight Dallas's and Espinosa!" Nash yelled I heard nothing from Cameron and we usually talk before we go to sleep so I went downstairs to see him kissing a girl.
"Cameron?" I say, he looks at me shockingly, "Keegan come here!" Cameron yelled hoping off the couch as I ran up stairs, I shut my room door and lock it.
Soon I'm fast asleep with tears in my eyes.
