I am surprise. This song is a really good song. I really enjoy it but I guess this song can't please everyone. Oh well. If you voted this song out then you get to vote again!  Just saying a good bit of these songs only need one more vote for it to be out. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME

HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
WELCOME TO THE SHOW
