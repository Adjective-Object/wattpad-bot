"Yes, I was aware of that, Ms. Gosselin," Carlos informed the girl, his eyes glued to the freeway. Chloe didn't respond to him after that, allowing the sound of The Wombats to fill up the room, replacing the silence. This was normally how things went, she usually ended up alone, even when there were other people in the room. She never understood why it was like that.
The girl pulled out her new phone from the purse Courtney bought her for Christmas, checking her email to see if Haley had sent her anything. There were a few sent about viral videos because even though she was Chloe's manager, she was still her best friend. She found a couple about some radio interviews and others about the girl's next album, so she just left them alone for Haley to explain to her, later.
"Ms. Gosselin, we have arrived," the tired man said, pulling her door open. He really was one of the best people she had ever hired. Plenty of them stayed then left, but not Carlos. He was loyal.
Chloe unlocked her door, tiptoeing to the kitchen, all the lights off. She still didn't understand why she kept sneaking around her own house; its not like she would get grounded from the TV for a week or kept at home. She was a legal adult. She could do whatever the hell she wanted.
The blonde grabbed a jar of peanut butter from the fridge, a silver spoon from the drawer across the stove, and ran up the stairs, feeling like there was a fuzzy, blue monster with orange horns and six eyes chasing her.
The girl yanked the tight, leather dress off her petite body, throwing it across the room so it landed among the rest of her dirty laundry. Her strapless bra followed it as she pulled her overly straightened hair into a lazy top knot. Little fly-aways stuck out from her head, reminding Chloe of Einstein. The thought made the girl chuckle, laughing at how stupid she was sometimes. She slipped into a gross, red shirt, tattooed with so many makeup and food stains, and orange track shorts.
Throwing away her used makeup wipe, Chloe climbed into bed, only to hear the doorbell ring. She began to mumble, annoyed with whoever was on the other side of the door, dragging her exhausted body to answer the bell. At this point, the girl didn't really care that she looked like absolute hell and answered the door. On the other side was Smith, sporting a plain V-Neck shirt and nike basketball shorts.
"You look like death," the curly haired boy laughed, stepping into her house. Chloe rolled her eyes at him, crossing her arms over chest. She tried her best to look pissed off with Smith just showing up at her home, but she couldn't help it. Without Smith, Chloe's life would suck.
"Smith, it's three in the morning. What are you doing here?" Her small feet ran up the stairs, the boy trailing in the back, after closing the door. This happened quite often. Smith would show up without warning, wanting to hang out, and Chloe was never mad. She'd act like she wanted to rip off his head for seven minutes, but in the end, she was thankful that he showed up. He just made the girl smile ten times brighter and laugh so much louder.
"Ice cream," he smiled, innocently. He lifted up a Target plastic bag, about four pints of ice cream swinging back and forth. The lop-sided smile he normally wore was sad, however, his hair matted down a bit. His eyes were red and puffy, his cheeks tear stained. Chloe looked at the boy, him knowing exactly what she was asking. "Dawn broke up with me."
