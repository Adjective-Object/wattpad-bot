Yes laugh at me. That really is funny.
Yes insult me. That really is true.
Yes make me feel like shit. That really is how I feel.
Yes walk all over me. That really is why I'm here.
Only,
Do the tears on my face look funny?
Do my empty plates really insult?
Do the cuts on my wrist make you feel any better about yourself?
Does my dead body help you walk over my further?
