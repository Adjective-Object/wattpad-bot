Between all those fake people, or should I say bodies? Since they got no feelings, I also noticed one of them who brought a cup of water and put some drops in her eyes to look like she was crying, seriously?
My cousins came, the only people here who honestly love me, Zainab and Amal, they ran toward me and hugged me with pure honest tears in their eyes, they loved both of my parents, we used to have sleepovers almost twice a week. We sat in silence, they had no words to say, so did I.
All my uncles came, so did my mother's brothers, they stood in line to see me and hug me and fake some tears then take some money when the lawyer arrives, If killing was halaal, I'd kill them. I'm not one of those people with hate in their blood, but those relatives are nothing but snakes, they keep walking in circles around you then attack you when you're not looking.
I did my best to not shout and scream in their faces and kick them out, I smiled and shook my head as if I believed a word they said.
"Be careful Leena, they want to take over your money, I heard them talking, and I hate the fact that my father made the whole plan" Zainab warned me, she spoke in English so those women don't understand us, I looked at her with tears in my eyes "We'll discuss that later, don't worry, I cannot be fooled easily".
At 11:00 pm,  there wasn't anybody left, beside me, Zainab and Uncle Muraad , Amal, Karam and Simon. Uncle Muraad (Zainab's father) lied on the couch comfortably like it was his own house,caught the remote and turned the TV on, I glanced at Zainab and she looked ashamed of his attitude, Simon was standing beside Karam with a frown on his face, Uncle Muraad pointed at Simon amd asked about his identity, Simon seemed to understand what my uncle said, "My name is Simon, I'm a friend of Karam's, I came from America few days ago and when I knew about the death of  his older brother,  I couldn't stand still, I came here to support him and he offered me a room here to stay beside him" Simon said, My uncle put his feet on the ground and stared at Simon, "And, did you know that this is not Karam's house, this is Leena's and her parent's house, so you are not allowed to stay here, please pack your bags and go to a hotel" My uncle Muraad said, Simon's eyes widened, Karam was about to say something, "Excuse me Uncle Muraad, but Karam has been living with us since my grandfather died and none of you of my other uncles wanted to take care of him, though all of you had much more money than us and we only had bread and olives to eat, Karam was like a big brother to me, so this is Karam's house also, not only mine, and he can bring any guest he wants, since when do we kick out guests? If my father was here he would welcome Simon and won't let him sleep in a hotel" I said, my uncle was left speechless, "But I also have a part of this house and of your money too, since your father died and you got no brothers" Uncle Muraad said with a smirk on his face, "Your part will be given to you as money instead of any of our properties" I exploaded in tears and ran to my room, Karam ran after me and knocked on my door few times but I didn't answer, I heard them downstairs having a fight, Karam and Muraad, Zainab and Amal joined too, I didn't hear Simon's voice, probably because he couldn't understand what they were saying since it all was in Arabic. I turned the light off and covered my shaking body with blankets, their voices went off, I head the gate open and close, My uncle must've left, I heard a knock on my door, Zainab and Amal came in and hugged me, Karam came after them  and he told me that the lawyer would be here in two days to discuss everything about my parents' fortune and how much my relatives would get. Me and my two cousins slept after letting go of many memories and tears.
I jumped out of bed scared of the voice that woke me up, I looked at the clock and it was 3:09 am, I heard something hit my window hard again, Zainab and Amal woke up too, I went to it and opened it and got to the balcony , it was Simon with plastic bags in his hands, "What do you want, it's too early" I yawned, Simon lowered his head and looked at the ground, "Cover yourself first" He said, I realized that I didn't have anything covering my head, I opened my closet and pulled a hijab then went back to see what Simon wants, "What do you want?" I asked him, "I bought you cake and coffee" He said, I smiled, "But I'm not alone" I said, "Ai know, that's why I brought extra cake and coffee for your cousins" He said, "Okay, climb up" I sneaked out the room and brought 4 chairs and pulled them to the balcony, Zainab and Amal asked me if I was crazy because I let Karam's friend get into my balcony at 3 am, I told them that I'll explain everything later, "Give me your hand" I caught Simon's hand and Pulled him, he was breathing heavily, "I almost slipped" He gasped, "Sit" I said, "Hi" Simon waved at my cousins and they waved back, "I here's your coffee, but please don't throw it over me, this time I might become blind"
