"What have I done?" I cried for hours, but the worse thing was that I wasn't crying out of fear or regret ... I was crying because I lost Simon... I had never thought that one day I'd cry over a boy instead of crying over a sin and asking for Allah's forgiveness.
.....
Two days later ...
I haven't heard anything from Simon, Karam said that everything was going well and that he'd be with me in 3 weeks.
No person other than Simon and Karam knew that I was back to America, "I'll show him what he lost, I'll make him cry over me" I whispered to myself as I was getting ready for school.
I got into tight pants, pink shirt that said "Blink if you want me" and tied my hair in a messy bun. A lipstick, some powder and a thin line of eyeliner and I was ready to go.
I walked into the school in my new, different, bold look, I grabbed everybody's attention without even asking, "Who is she?" I heard a boy ask then I saw Conor walking in my direction with a smirk on his face, "Hi" He said then stared at my shirt and started blinking, "Go away, jerk" I pushed him and headed to my locker, I opened it then suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder, "Excuse me, this is my friend's locker" I turned around and it was Helen, "Yeah I know" I said and smiled at her, "LEENA !" She shouted, everybody looked amazed and confused at the same time, "Leena, is that you?" Conor asked, "No, it's her twin" I said sarcastically, "Well, this changes many things" He said as he put his palm on my shoulder, "Except you being a jerk" I said then Miley came and pulled him as they were arguing, "What happened ! You changed" Diana hugged me, "Well, nobody stays the same" I chuckled, "I'm sorry for your loss" Helen said, "It's Okay ... but why didn't you call me ? Gow can yoy call yourself (friends) ?" I raised an eyebrow, "We're sorry, we were kind of busy, and we didn't know what to say" Diana started making up some stupid excuses, "You know what? You're such a great liars, none of you called me, none of you sent me a message. If you were true friends, you would've stood beside me, I was in need for friends" I walked away from them, I acted harshly but I was right, what kind of friends that doesnt call you ir check up on you for a month? Plus, my parents died and I was emotionally broken, they should've at least left a voice message.
I looked at my right and saw Simon staring at me, I was about to spit on him but I did my best to ignore him, I walked toward Peter who was standing with Simon and started flirting with him, "Hi Peter, you look great today" I smiled at him, "And you look hot ! Where were you hiding all this beauty?"
"LEENA, Stop this ! Don't act like Miley" Simon's grip tightened around my arm, "And who are you to tutor me ?" I pulled my arm and headed to my class.
....
2 weeks later ...
You may not believe it ... but I became friends with Miley, Connor, Jake and their other jerky friends more than anybody else. We started eating,hanging out and playing together. I started talking and acting like them, my clothes went tighter and shorter, I started helping Miley with bullying and I ran away from school many times, my grades went low and my rudeness went high.
Damon tried getting close to me, but I didn't let him. Elina, Helen, Hana, Diana and all my old friends tried to help me, but the weird thing was that I hadn't even seen Molly.
"What do you think you're doing?" Tom asked angrily as I was eating with my new crew, "Umm, eating ?" I answered sarcastically and they giggled, "Get up, we need to talk" Tom pulled me from my seat, "Hey! What are you doing?" Jake stood up for me, "Stay out of it" Tom warned Jake, "Oh really ? Or what?" Conor stood up too, "Calm down dudes, we're just having a normal conversation !" I told Conor and Jake, "Just tell me if he annoys you, alright bae?" Jake kissed my cheek ... I might have skipped the part where me and Jake got into a relationship, well, me and Jake got into a relationship, he wanted it because I became the hottest girl in school, and I did it just to annoy Simon. "Alright babe" I smiled and walked with Tom.
