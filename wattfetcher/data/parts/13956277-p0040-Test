before closing my eyes "Where's my phone" I jumped.
"In the car, I'll bring it" He walked to the car.
He came back and handed me my phone, I called dad.
The moment of truth has come.
"Assalamu Alaykom, are you home yet ?" Dad asked.
"Yeah father"
"What did you want to tell me"
"Dad ...." And I told him everything.
"WHAT ! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME" Dad shouted, I started to cry.
"I-I didn't want to make you worried about me"
"ARE YOU CRAZY ! YOU'RE LIVING WITH A MAN"
"Dad Wallah he's good and nice he's like a brother to me"
"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR A WORD, YOU'RE COMING HOME"
I saw Damon's face filled with worry and concern.
"Dad, so you trust me" I asked.
"I used to trust you but you lied to me" He said with disappointment in his tone.
"I'm sorry, Wallah it was the first time I ever lie to you, I lied because I want to stay here. That family loves me, I'm one of them now"
"There's a boy, It's haram to stay alone with a boy"
"Dad, I have my own room  and bathroom, and he's out most of the time, I only see him in the morning when we have breakfast and in school and in dinner or lunch"
"You're coming back home, END OF DISCUSSION" Tears covered my cheeks and skirt which was already covered with blood.
"No dad please, I like it here, I'm not a baby anymore, I'm and adult now. That's my life and I wanna live it the way I want. I don't want to come back to the place I was chained in, I want to live father, I'm happy here"
"If you're happy then- *clears throat* We'll discuss that later. I wanna talk to the boy. What's his name ?"
"D-Damon" I said. Damon's eyes widened.
"My father wants to talk to you" I handed him the phone, he started shake.
"H-Hello sir" His face was filled with fear.
"Y-Yes sir .... Okay I won't ... Yeah th-that's fine with me" He gave me the phone.
"yes dad" I asked
"Me and your mother will talk and discuss everything then we'll let you know our last decision, salam"
"Salaam father I love you, sorry" and he hung up.
I saw Damon frozen on the couch "What did he tell you" I asked.
"He said that if touch you or hurt you he'll hunt me and rip my body apart and put every part in a box and burn them, he said he'll even haunt me in my dreams" Damon's eyes were still wide.
"What did he tell you" He asked me.
"He said I have to go back home"
"WHAT" Everyone in the house shouted.
"I deserve that, I lied" I said in shame.
"B-bu-but Nooooh" Elina sobbed.
"I'm sorry but I knew that this will happen, eventually" I hugged her.
"Try to convince them" Mrs.Carter said.
