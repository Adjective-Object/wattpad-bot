Ah, Vegas. The perfect place for Taylor Swift concerts, drinking, gambling, and getting married.
Now, let's explain.
Dean and Cas were in Vegas for a concert. Taylor Swift, obviously. Dean's favorite.
They had a lot of fun, so they decided to milk it a little.
Which ended up being a lot.
They decided to go to a casino. Which, unfortunately, doubled as a bar.
They were both drunk off their asses. Surprisingly, this made Dean extremely amazing at gambling.
In the end, Dean made $33,660.
And so, this conversation ensued(they are not in a relationship, mind you, and they are both drunk. REALLY. DRUNK.):
Cas: "L-Look, Dean. I am super in love with you. I mean, your fucking face alone. It's peeeeerrrrrfection. Like, seriously, you need to stop being sooooooo pretty."
Dean: "Cas, no way. I am super in love with YOU. Your face is a work of an angel. And your eyes. They're like... little pieces of the sky, but bluer. It's, like, stupid, how blue they are."
Cas: "Wait. So... I'm in love with you."
Dean: "Yup."
Cas: "And you're in love with me?"
Dean: "Mhmm."
Cas: "How are we not making out?"
Dean: "I don't know. Let's fix that."
So they made out. For a long time. Like, it was outrageous. They should've ran out of air long before they stopped kissing.
"I just had an amazing idea, Dean," Cas told him when they came up for air.
"And what would that be?" Dean asked.
"You know how you've, like, been amazing at throwing dice and winning money tonight?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Well, how about if you roll a... nine, because we met in September, we get married?" Castiel suggested.
"Okay! I've wanted to kiss you for so long that marrying you should make up for it."
"I can't believe in all the years we've known each other we never though of this. We're roommates, for God's sake!"
"Whatever. Can I kiss you again? That was fun."
"Hey, keep it in your pants. We could be, like, engaged in a second."
"Okay," Dean sighed.
"But yeah, kiss me again, then roll the damn dice," Castiel amended.
So Dean kissed him. Then he rolled the damn dice.
It landed on a six and a two.
Cas looked so sad, it hurt Dean's soul.
"Cas, will you marry me?" he asked.
Cas brightened a bit, but he was still confused and a little crestfallen. "But Dean, it's not a nine. You don't have to marry me."
"Cas, I want to marry you. That might be an eight, but you're the ONE for me, and, last time I checked, eight plus one equals nine."
"Oh, Dean, I love you. So much," Cas told him.
"I love you, too."
Then they were in the chapel.
Then they said "I do."
