Dear Reader, My name is John Reynolds. In the Summer of 1996 my mother was hit and killed by a car, shortly after that my father decided to sell our small farm in Kentucky and with the money. we had moved to Salem Massachusetts. In a Colonial Style house. And this is my story.....
December 12th 1996 As my Dad and I Finished taking the boxes out of the moving van (I could tell he was still mourning over the loss of my mother) He told me that this was going to be our new life though I didn't believe him at the time. I stayed silent, it was a misty morning and the smell of wet grass filled my nose I looked around my new street two houses down I could just barely see an old Street sign that said Manson boulevard. Then my father said something that scared the crap out of me (at the time) "Son i think there is a boy next door maybe later you can invite him over and play or whatever" I hadn't talked to many people besides my dad after my mom had died so i just simply shrugged and carried what was left of my stuff into the house. Though i had already been in at least 10 different times i still wasn't used to the Smell of bad meat we didn't know where it was coming from but the house hadn't been lived in since 1991. Because the old residents had left with no notice. As I slowly creeped up the stairs with every step having its own creaking noise I found my room at the end of the hallway on the 2nd floor as i pushed open the door I could start to see cobwebs and pieces of random wood i just decided to drop off my stuff and take up my dads offer and went next door
