Ruby POV
I speed down the high way wiping my tears. If only she would let me explain! Yes I'm engaged but then again I'm not. Phobe is her name. We we're together 3 years ago. My mom matched us up and it was great at first until I found out about the true her. She cheated all through our relationship and when I broke it off she told my mom and at the time I was living with my parents. My mom made me propose to her....But on the day of our marriage I moved out and changed my number. My mom promised me she wouldn't tell her anything about where I disappeared to ...But I guess that changed when she met tash. Damn I miss her already. I'm so mad. I shouldve  told her. We would still be together if I had. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is my 57th time calling her and she still won't answer. I finally find love again just to Fuck up. If only she knew how she has my heart I've never felt this way about anyone...I call one last time and she....She actually picked up!
Me- baby please let me explain!Tash- Ruby....I think this is for the best. I'm leaving and moving to new York. Me: what? No you can't!Tash- babe it's for the best. I leave tomorrow....you really hurt me ruby. I fell so hard for you. It's like I can't breathe without you. Me- can't you see that I am yours?Tash- but your engaged to someone else ruby. Me- STOP saying THAT. It wasn't my choice to get engaged to her! We aren't even engaged I just never took the ring away.
I heard her sigh then she replied " I love you ruby I really do...goodbye."  I started crying running my hand through my hair " I love you two but don't say goodbye....we aren't over. This just a bump in the road for us. " She sniffed " ruby-" Phoebe-  baby your home!
I jumped. How the hell did she get in here? " What the-" then I heard the dial tone. She hung up.  I lost her.
