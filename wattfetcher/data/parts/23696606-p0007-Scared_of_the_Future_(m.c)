I opened the bathroom door, to hear Ashton and Michael playfully arguing over couch-seats. "You're going to sit next to ME!" Ashton yelled while giggling. "NO! I wanna sit next to Lilith!" Michael replied. Ashton made a disappointed growling sound and slumped down in the lean-chair beside the couch. I cleared my throat, catching their attention. "Do I get a saying in this?" "Yes" "No" they both said at the same time. "You're sitting next to me, end of the story." Michael pointed to the couch, making me shake my head and chuckle under my breath as I sat down. They had already set up the movie, and was ready to start at any time.
"Here," Ashton said, handing me a warm cup of tea. "Fantastic, thanks," I breathed out, taking the warm cup in my hands. I swear I could feel both Michael and Ashton stare at me as I closed my eyes and took a sip of the hot beverage. As soon as the warm liquid met my tongue, a familiar sweet taste filled my mouth. "Mm, Peach?" I asked, opening my eyes to be met with one surprised face, and one kinda relieved looking one.
"Yeah," Michael breathed out and smiled at me. "My favorite." I grinned at him. "Mine too." I said before Ashton interrupted. "Alright ladies, are we gonna watch this depressing teen-flick or not?" Michael and I shut up, covered ourselves in the blankets and concentrated on the TV on the wall. "Roll the clip!" Michael shouted and put his arm around my shoulder as the movie started.
