"Can you please tell me what happened the other day? I don't like to see you cry. "
"I don't want to talk about it. Don't you already know? Cause you were there on the day it happened and you were smirking when he apologized. Did you do something?"
I was taken by surprise when he waved my questions and pressed his lips against mine. I surprised myself by kissing him back. The kiss was slow and  passionate. My heart started to dance and swirl around, my stomach churned and a gazillion butterly fluttered in my stomach. It felt like forever until we separated, resting our foreheads on each other. We panted, breathlessly and I let out a huge smile. This was my first kiss. It was beautiful, better than I imagined.
" Thank you for an incredible first kiss." He complimented as my cheeks flushed bright crimson.Er my god. This was Alec's first kiss too.
