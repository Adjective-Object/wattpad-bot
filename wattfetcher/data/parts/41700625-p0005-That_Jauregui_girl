Lauren's POV(Date outfits above)                        I woke up snuggled next to Micka on the couch. I have to pee really bad."Meeks move." I say and she burys her head in my shoulder."No, Lolo please five more minutes."she says. I grab her cheeks and say "For a 13 year old you have really big cheeks."She moves to get away from me and I get up and went to the bathroom. I walked back in and saw her looking in the mirror."I'm a 13 year old who has abs." I chuckled and look at her four pack. Well I guess softball can do that to someone. I sat on her bead and it was quite."How long have you and Wyatt been dating?" I ask "Like 2 months." She says and smiles." How long has camren been real?" She says and her smile gets bigger. Aye Michaela Jauregui the biggest camren shipper I've known."Like 6 months." I say."Speak of the devil." I mumbled as I got a call from Camz.C:Is the date formal or casual?L:Karla Camila Cabello, We are going on a date with two 13 year olds what do you think? *scarcasm*C:Casual.L:Yep babe just yepC:Love you lolo see you laterL:Love you too babe bye
"How's Mila?" Micka asked and Taylor walks and flops down on Micka's bed. "Morning Tay." I say sounding like I am a morning person."Yea yea, Meeks what are wearing on your date?" She says and look at her and pretend that I'm hurt."What about me?" I say."Ok princess Lauren, What are you wearing sweetheart." She says and continues to look in Micka's closet."You should wear this." Taylor says as she gets Micka the outfit (above). Micka walks into the bathroom and changes. She walks out and says "Damn I'm hot af." Taylor and I laugh. I go to my room and get changed. It'sabout 4:30. I get changed and walk out of my room. Wyatt is Camila's cousin.
"Meeks, you ready?" I yell as I run down the stairs and grab my keys."Yep!" She says popping the "p"." I don't want to pick you guys up from the police station, so don't do anything stupid."We won't." Micka and I say at the same time." Bye love you." They said as we walked out the door."Love you too!" We both yell.
Micka's POV
We start driving to Camz's house and Lauren was asking me stupid questions on my relationship. We finally got there and we walked to Camz's front door. Wyatt answered and hugged me. He was gonna kiss me but Lauren would have killed him."Hey Lo, Mila is upstairs. Taking forever!." He says and groans."I'm coming." Mila says as she runs down the stairs."You look beautiful babe." Lauren says and kisses her. The like kissed for 2 minutes in till I yelled "Are we going?" Bae being cute said "Or nah?" Lauren and Camila walked out the door first and we followed. "Wyatt, you sit up front." Lauren says trying to scare him."Um O-ok." He says because he actually is scared of my sister.
After the drive to the movie theater. We went inside and walked up to the ticket booth."4 adults to Pitch Perfect 2." Wyatt said and gave the cashier $20."Such a gentleman, Wyatt." Lauren says with a hint of sarcasm."Lauren Michelle." Camila warns her which is pretty funny. We go and get drinks and Wyatt pays again. That boy knows he doesn't have to pay for anything because he has me so whipped but he does. Camila and Lauren picked their spots so we sat a row above them. Every time I would laugh I would throw popcorn at Lauren."Knock your shit off Micka." Lauren said sounding annoyed.
The movie ended and we dropped off Camila and Wyatt."So Wyatt is not that bad." Lauren says laughing."Really Laur?! You thought he was going to be bad.""Yea but know I now know that he's a gentlemen and he treats you right like he supposed to." "Ok Laur."                 We got backed to the house and I went straight to bed. Then I realized that I had practice at 10:30am tomorrow. I ran to My parents room and jumped on the bed."Hey Papi I have a game tomorrow at 10:30 but I got to be there at 8:45. Can you or Mami take me?" Softball is my passion so I like to spend time at the field for a while."I can take you." Lauren says ease dropping."Lauren, are you sure?" My dad says."Yea but I can come home and sleep before your game?" She says knowing that she can."Yep." I say popping the 'p'."Night love you guys." I said to all of them.
