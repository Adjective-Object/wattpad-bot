"No! She's going to come back! She is!" I tried convincing him and myself, but I knew she wasn't. It was to late.
"Jaycie. May I please see her?" Dad asked me, his own voice cracking.
I was hesitant but I slowly let her go. Dad grabbed Mom from my hands. All I could do is look at my bloody hands. It was my moms blood. All I could do is stare at my hands and cry. Even as my brother hugged me I could only cry. He picked me up as my body shook with sobs.
"I'm so sorry you both had to witness your moms death." I heard Will say, but all I could do is cry.
'It's all my fault.'
