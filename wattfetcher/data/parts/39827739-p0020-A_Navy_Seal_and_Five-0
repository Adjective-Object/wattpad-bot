"Kylie open your eyes"  I pleaded to her. The ambulance arrived and I put her on the stretcher. The EMTs quickly put an oxygen mask on her and rushed her to the hospital. Danny and I hopped in the Camaro and I drove as fast as I could to the hospital. I couldn't think straight. All I could think about was Kylie when she was eight and coughing and wheezing.

Danny's POV:
Steve has been by Kylie's side since she the doctors put her on the oxygen. The doctors said that she was lucky. An asthma attack that bad could have put her in a coma. I could tell Steve was relieved that Kylie would be okay but he still had a guilty look on his face.
"It's not your fault, Steve. We didn't expect Wo Fat to know that she had asthma or that he knew what would trigger her asthma" I told him. He wouldn't look at me, so I decided to go get some coffee for both me and Steve. Especially Steve, with the way he wouldn't leave Kylie's side he was going to need coffee more than me.
"Danny" Kono said walking towards me. "How is she?" Kono, Chin and Catherine arrived all with worried looks on their faces.
"She's going to be fine; she's asleep right now. The doctors have her on oxygen and are keeping her overnight because her oxygen levels are back in forth right now. Anything on Wo Fat?" I asked. Kono shook her head.
"Nothing. We did find out that he hired Kylie's uncle, Sean, and to trap Kylie. The plane was planned to fly to Moscow. I think maybe they were planning to use Kylie's skills to make selling drugs and other things easier" Kono explained.
"So they were planning on using Kylie as a way to make deals under the radar?" I asked. Poor Kylie. First she loses her dad, then her uncle plans on using her as a slave to make his drug business full proof.
"Yeah, at least that's what Sean planned. We don't know how he got into contact with Wo Fat or why he was working for him" Chin explained.
"Okay, thanks guys" I said and they all said their good-byes and left. I sighed and looked at Steve. He'd fallen asleep holding Kylie's hand. I knew how much he cared about Kylie; he acted like she was his daughter and not his niece. Kylie, I will admit, is one brave kid. I looked at Kylie and I saw a kid who has grown up solving crimes, dealt with the death of her father, moved across country to an island, became part of Interpol, and has fought off a family member and a major arms dealer, but to others she just looked like any other fifteen year old.
