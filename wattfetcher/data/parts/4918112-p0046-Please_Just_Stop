I don't even know. How is it that so many people can throw all of their morals out the window and sell themself like this? It's like standing on a street corner... sort of.
I'm going to admit something, I used to do this. Sort of. Back when the SYS was around, I stood on a corner of the SYS world and bartered off my story to get reads. I actually read the other end's story, but thinking back on it, I feel so filthy for stooping that low to get attention. Thankfully, I've learned my lesson since then. I only like honest reads now. I only like it if you actually read my shit and like it. Hate it? That's cool too. Just as long as I have an actual, genuine opinion from you, I could care less.
But these people... these people who barter off reads like it's a business...
You aren't real writers. You are just posers hoping to get into a rigged ranking list that frankly doesn't care how good you are. You're throwing yourselves away by wasting your time, and you disgust me to no goddamn end.
I need to end this rant here, or I'm going to end up throwing my netbook against the wall.
