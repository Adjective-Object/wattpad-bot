We're almost nearing the crucial parts of the story, guys!
Now, Chapter Six will start to contain lots of danger and...feels for you. That's right. You'll be all confused and sh*t. But, don't worry, they'll be there for you.
But also take note that they're after YOU.
And yes, the "they're" I'm talking about are the 2P! Hetalia characters.
But they'll be around by about...Chapter...8 or 9...so if you love them 2Ps...you gotta wait! <3
So, for now, it's still "HetaOni (Hetalia x Reader). But once the 2Ps make their appearance, it'll be entitled "HetaOni (Hetalia x Reader x 2P! Hetalia)"...
Before any of that, though.... may I just say that Chapter 7 (Which I'll post...by...hmm...Friday? tba ) ...is my favourite chapter yet. Why? You guys will find out!
Anyways, I just wanted to say thanks to all who are reading this fic! :) I've placed some careful thought on how the plot is supposed to play out. I even have an ending written xD But yeah...I can't really update that fast because of school and stuff, so sorry if it took me a while to update this.
Oh! Tell me if you guys have any opinions on the chapters and also tell me if there are some confusing parts so that I can edit them for you~
I really like feedback. They inspire me to keep on posting chapters. You readers inspire me ;)
Alright, rant done XD
Chapter 6 (Part 2) is up next! <3
