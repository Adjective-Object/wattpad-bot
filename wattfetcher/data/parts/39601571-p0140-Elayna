Okay so this whole...situation with cater and Maggie is really out of control.
So first I just want to say I love Carter to death. He's just like the other guys.But Maggie clearly stated that she didn't want to give Carter a blow job and he basically made her. WHILE RECORDING IT!
Not only is that sexual harassment but he was acting like he didn't even care about her opinion in this. And then he said his he could turn the flash off if she was uncomfortable. Like no.
Why don't you try not recording it and maybe not harass her. I love Maggie. Always have. I also love Carter and always have but what he did was not right.
And then to post it online. For everyone to see? No.
I'm sorry but that's just....no.
