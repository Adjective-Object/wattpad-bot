So I know this kid whos dad left him and went to mexico
No one knows where he is
And the kids all like
"Why does my daddy always come when im not here?"
I stayed silent
"He does come right?"
Me: "y-yeah he does he just... always gets the days mixed up!"
Him: " *smiles* im gonna see himÂ  when I'm ten!"
Me:'how old are u?"
Him: im seven three more years !
Me: *nods* thats great
I felt so bad for him I swear
