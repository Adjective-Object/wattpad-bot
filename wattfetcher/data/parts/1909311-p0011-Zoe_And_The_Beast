A/N: Hi again! This is a short chapter - I'm sorry! There was a bit of sudden drama, but I was in the mood.
I do edit, but there are times when I miss things. Please let me know if you see mistakes!
Anyway, back to the point! Feel free to VOTE, and comment! And maybe even fan... ;)
ALSO, Zach's picture is on the right!
Thanks for reading!
