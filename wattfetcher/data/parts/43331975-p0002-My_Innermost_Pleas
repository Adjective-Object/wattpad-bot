Can you listen to the birds tweet?  I know I can't--I'm deaf.  But O, how the bluebirds cry!  If you can hear them, then...well, here's the thing.  I'm not really deaf.  But you...can you gear them, truly?  Because birds are so quiet, so small and puny, anybody can not hear them.  Truly comprehend what I'm saying right now...no, not saying, ranting.  Because you can't.  You don't understand--can't listen.  And that, although I can't respect it, I can understand it, like so many others can't, if they can't hear the call of the birds.
