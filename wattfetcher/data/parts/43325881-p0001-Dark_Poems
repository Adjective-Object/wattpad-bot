Although she seems so happy.No one really see's.When she acts so peppyAll she wears are long sleeves.
While her friends don't notice the sadness in her eyes.They just can't see.No one cares that that she cries.But she only wear that long sleeve.
Now they realize they should have cared.Now that she's gone they see.That her wrist had so must to bare.Now they see she only wore long sleeves.
A.N.I hope any one who reads this enjoys. And when there is any thing triggering I will put a warning at the beginning of that poem. Also if any one thinks this is too mature please tell me so I can change the rating thing. Thank you.
