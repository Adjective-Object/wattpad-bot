The bathroom was super nice. Like for an RV, this was nicer than some real bathrooms I've been in. I shut the door behind me and I changed into his Blue Jackets hockey jersey. Once I was in the jersey I took the time to fold my shirt and jeans. I took off my Keds and my 'no-show' socks and tucked the socks into the shoes. I then turned around, opened the door and turned out the bathroom light.
Once I walked back out into the living room/kitchen area, I set my clothes on the couch. I walked near the door, so I was facing in, so if you just walked into the RV you'd see the 'Elliott' on my back. I bent over and places my shoes on the floor and as soon as I did that Chase walked in. "Woah! I'm sorry - I should've knocked!"I stood back up, oops, when I bent over he might have seen my underwear. Not that it was a thong or anything but I appreciate that he apologized. "No, it's your RV, I'm sorry! I went into the bathroom to change and I came out here and, I'm sorry.""Anyway," his face looked a little flushed, hahaha oops! "Here's your pants," he handed me my white leggings - with the tag still on. "I'll be right back, I'm going to change into sweats, I'll be right back." He smiled as he walked past me, letting his hand trail on my back as he walked past. I heard the clicking of the closet doors and then the bathroom door shut. I walked over to the cabinet that the TV was sitting on, leggings still clutched in my hand, and I open it up to reveal the many DVD's he had. He had a wide range; from Disney, like Beauty and the Beast to modern like Frozen, to horror movies like the exorcist and the ring. He had funny movie too like 'we are the Millers' and the classic 'airplane'. Oh my gosh he also had High School Musical. I pulled it out of the cabinet.
