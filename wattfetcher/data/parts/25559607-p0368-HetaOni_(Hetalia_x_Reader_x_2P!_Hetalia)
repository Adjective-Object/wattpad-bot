America, England, and I walked out of the saferoom to head over to the annexe. We were supposed to go there altogether, but when I sensed someone was on the other side of the hall, I told America and England to go ahead of me.

When I finally reached the other hall, I was met with a very surprising turn of events.

"....Bella, is that you...?"



The ragazza turned around and faced me. "...H-Huh? Luciano?" she asked, squinting her eyes.


"V-Ve...? Bella...you don't remember me? It's me, Italy!" I told her. I had a suspicion and the uncomfortable feeling in my gut is making it worse.


She furrowed her eyebrows. "U-Uhm? You mean you're...Italian..er, is that it?"


"No... I mean, I am....but! Oh no...Hmm.. I'm Feliciano." I said, my lips starting to tremble a little.


She tilted her head. "You look a lot like someone I know...."


"I think I know who you're referring to, but to be clear, I'm not him. Are you sure you don't remember me, bella?"
