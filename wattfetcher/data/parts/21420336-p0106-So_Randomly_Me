So I changed my username so don't be alarmed
I was tired of my username because after all Nico is my bro and - what
Poor Nico
Nico: ;-; I know
Anyways, don't you hate it when big authors on wattpad don't bother to even follow anyone backIt's so freaking rude
It seems conceited in my opinion because come on you aren't so big that you have written your own book and it's been published
in fact: I met an author who actually follows everyone back on Instagram and answers to comments and Dms people
And see that's nice because she must get thousands of comments on a daily basis and she still acts nice
I understand actual authors can't do this all the time butReallyWattpad authorsCalm your egoYou're like 14
