People say being a nerd sucks but I think its awesome. But last year I found out who cares what people say or think about you. Here is where my adventure started.
It was my first year at South Eastern High School. I walked down the corridors with all my friends, wearing the latest clothing brands.... Well I wish it was like that but no. I walked down the corridors wearing my ripped jeans, an orange top, my arms wrapped around my books and my big. Dorky. Glasses. They called me Nerd. I was trying to find my home room while getting pushed around the corridors, slamming into the lockers. I finally found my home room, the door was brown with a silver door knob. The bell rung. And a stampede of people running towards me. They pushed me and I fell to the hard ground. I lose my glasses.
"Not again, I can't broke another pair," I say.
I have really terrible eye sight so I can't see a thing. But I can just make out what I can see. Some person was holding my glasses.
"Here you go," the person said.
It sound like a guy I thought to myself.
"Thank you," I say.
I quickly put my glasses on. Its Christian Hathaway, the most popular person in school. I can't help but to look at his black, messy hair and his jade green eyes.
"Are you alright?," he asked."Yeah, I'm fine," I say. I can't help but blush so I hide my face with my books. "OK, be careful next time," he says."Alright."
He walks in another direction and I quickly walk into my home room. As I walk in Natasha stops me going to my seat.
"I see you were talking to Christian," she said in her mean voice.
Natasha "Tasha" Tanner. The biggest bully in school and she always picks on me. With her long blonde curled hair and her pale blue eyes, she thinks she is the best.
What does she want now! I thought to myself.
