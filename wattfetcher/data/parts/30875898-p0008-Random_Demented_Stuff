You just leave me bleeding,
It's only my precious blood,
Your words hurt so much more than any razors ever could.
Go ahead and leave me bleeding,
I guess I have no use for blood,
You say, "Go run, go hide, go die!", and it hurts more than weapons ever would.
Don't worry, I know I'm bleeding,
Even if you can't see the blood,
Because actually I can see,
My heart burst inside of me,
And I can see it bleed, and bleed, and bleed, and bleed,
More than my tiny broken heart ever ever should.
