A/N- Just something that I wrote a long time ago when things got really bad at home
I stay back,
Hidden behind these walls
I keep quiet,
Nobody needs to here my calls
I don't care,
They call me worthless,
And that's all I'll ever be
They call me a good-for-nothing,
I know,
They're just reassuring me
I know it's my fault,
And that's what they say
They put me in fear for my life,
Every single day
They're suppose to take care of me,
I'm the one they should love
But the only thing they care about,
Is their money, beer, and numbing drugs
They look at me with disgrace,
They lock me in my room,
Yeah, they think I'm a mistake
So I'll stay in the background,
And keep my mouth closed
And I won't tell anyone about the bruises,
In hopes I don't exposed
