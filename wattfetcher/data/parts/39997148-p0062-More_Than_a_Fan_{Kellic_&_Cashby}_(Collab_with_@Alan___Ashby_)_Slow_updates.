"Fine, fine then I won't get one."
"Austin Carlile get your butt over here and kiss me."
I smiled at him and leaned in kissing him. I pulled away and smirked.
"Happy now?" I asked and he nodded and pulled me back to him.
"Just one more." He muttered kissing me again.  I smiled into the kiss before pulling away again.
"Better?"
"I think so."
"Now be a good student and do your stuff."
"Well you need to go be a good rockstar and get ready for your interview."
"I am ready. I don't do anything special."
"Whatever." He said rolling his eyes.
"I could go looking like garage and I think the fangirls would still adore me."
"Don't get cocky babe."
"I think it's too late for that."
"I know, but it's just wishful thinking." He said, "Now hush I have to work."
"But I want to hang out with you before I leave."
"Well you can just be quiet."
"That's boring." I sighed, "Can I cuddle with you?"
"No Aust, I need to work." He whined.
"But Alan!"
"Fine but just for a little bit."
"Yes." I said. He moved over and I got into his bunk next to him and he cuddled up to me resting his head on my chest.
"Happy?" He asked looking up at me.
I nodded, "Most definitely."
"Good, when's your interview?"
"In like fifteen minutes or so."
"Good." He muttered.
"Why?"
"I get like ten minutes of Austin time before you have to go so you're not late."
"I'd be late if I got to hang out with you." I said kissing his forehead.
"Well as sweet as that is you can't be late for your interview."
"I know but they're so boring."
"Yeah well fans like them." He told me.
"Yeah I know."
"Why are they so boring?" He asked curious.
"They're the same old questions every time. Like hows the album? Work on new stuff? How's touring? And then a few random fun one's here and there but I don't like doing them too much."
"Well this one is probably going to be a little different."
"Why do you say that?" I asked curiously.
"Because everyone is probably going to be very curious about the hot ginger you were making out with in that picture."
"Oh yeah... If I do get asked about that, what should I say?"
"Tell them that you're dating that sexy ginger and you're a very lucky guy."
"You told me not to be cocky."
"Yeah, you're not allowed to be cocky. But that doesn't mean I can't be."
