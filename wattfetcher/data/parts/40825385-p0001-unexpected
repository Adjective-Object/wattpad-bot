After landing on earth a green girl came out of her escape pod. "man im beat..." she said dusting off her shoulder. her name is peridot,a jem from home wrold and the reason she was in a escape pod was because her ship was destroyed by those traitors,the crystal jems. her and a orange girl named jasper was going to re-activate kindergarten but they were stoped by those traitors . While she was thinking what to do next, she heard a splash,  and curious she walked to the ocean were she found a blue girl in a dress. "lapis?" she said scratching her head, she walked closer to her to found out that she fainted.......and wet. Peridot started a fire and laid the blue girl next to it so she can warm up but she's still sleeping. "what was she doing in the ocean?" she thought to her self while looking for somthing to sit on. After 2 hours later peridot heard lapis waking up. "were am i?" geting up from her spot, she looked all over till her eyes landed on a green figure sleeping.
