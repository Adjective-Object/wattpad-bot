*A/N- Yeah I know I'm a bit late to be writing something about Valentine's Day. Deal with it, this took forever to write!*
A bouquet of roses, trampled on
A box of chocolates, melted by the sun
I was going to give them to you but I was too afraid
Shy Valentine,  that's my name
A smile on your lips, I wanted that kiss
A step forward, it was a hit or miss
I chickened out, so many times I rehearsed this in my brain
Shy Valentine, that's my name
A beating heart, just for you
A homemade card, but what to do?
I give it all to you, you look at me like I'm insane
Brokenhearted Valentine, this is my new name
