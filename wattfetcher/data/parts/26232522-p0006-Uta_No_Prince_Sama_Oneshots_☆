(Name) sighed as she waited underneath the waiting shed. Today was the first annual Piyo chan festival. And it was raining.
Worst, she even forgot to bring your umbrella with her. It's the reason why (name) is waiting for this rain to stop.
She groaned in frustration. She was very excited for this day to come! Meeting and playing with her favorite mascot is heaven! She didn't thought of this would have happened.
While she was looking at the dark crying sky, a blonde passed by in front of her. The guy had shades on, so it was hard to tell who he is.
He stopped at his tracks and looked at (Name). When she noticed he was looking at her, she snapped out of her day dream.
"Are you going to the Piyo-chan festival?" He asked with a smile. She nodded. "Yes. But sadly, I don't have an umbrella with me," (Name) said. Adding an apologetic smile.
Why was this stranger asking her? She thought. Self curiosity ruining her.
He chuckled. "I am going too. Why don't we go together?" Her (E/C) orbs sparkled.
"Are you sure you don't mind?" She asked. He shook his head. "I don't."
She blushed as she ran towards him under the umbrella with him. "I'm Natsuki," He introduced with a smile. "And you?"
"I'm (Name)," She responded. "(Name) (Last Name)."
"Well, it's nice to meet you (Name)!" Natsuki smiled at her, making her heart melt.
"Now let's get going!" He said as you giggled. "Sure."
Because of the rain, the giant idol met the piyo-chan of his own.
