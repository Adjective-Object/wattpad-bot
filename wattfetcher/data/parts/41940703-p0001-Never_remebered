I was watching a beautiful world from hetalia, the april fools episode.
"I got this outfit along with the letter."America said walking in without a shirt.
"Ermahgursh, Why you have to be so muscular Alfie?!" I squieled, being an amazin- no awesome hetalian.
I stared at the screen watching America, Iggy and France argue.
Until someone, a country I think, appeared infront of the screen.
"Ahhh!" I yelped in surprise.
I hand was coming from the screen, I backed away in fear.
The hand extended more and grabbed my ankle.
"Help!" I screamed for help.
but I was alone so the hand was able to drag me in.
-tym skyp-
"Hey dudes, there's a girl here!" I heard a voice yell.
The voice sounded so familiar, it sounded like, no could it be.....
America?
I felt someone pick me up in bridal and carry me someplace, a few minutes later I felt something soft.
I was finally able to open my eyes and I was right.
America was the one carrying me.
"Oh hey duddete glad you're awake." he said with a smile.
'am I dreaming?' I thought to myself as I stared into space.
"Um are you alright?" he asked waving his hand infront of my face.
"um, yes." I said quickly.
"my name's -"
I cut him of saying.
"Alfred F. Jones."
"Woah, how did you know."
Oh no, why did I say that he'll probably think I'm a stalker.
"Um, lucky guess." I said.
"Alright, what's yours?"
"The name's Sora." I said.
"America is she up yet?" A voice said coming from the doorway.
"Yes." I said.
He peeped threw the doorway.
"I-iggy?"
"what did you call me?" He asked.
"Dude, isn't it obvious she said Iggy."Alfred said.
"How did you know my bloody nickname?" he asked stepping into the room.
"Uhhhh......"
'what do I do, what what?!' I asked myself.
"Um, love are you alright?"
"yes."
"My name is Arthur so don't call me Iggy." He said.
I felt someon tap my shoulder.
it was america.
I leaned nearer and he whispered something in my ear.
"Call him Iggy." He said then smirked.
I stood up and walked to a mirror then screamed!
"What, why?!"
