Hey guys just a quick note! A friend of mine here on Wattpad told me that her school wrote and recorded a song to raise awareness for mental health. The song is available on iTunes and is really good! The song is All Your Love- Single by St. Benedict School of Rock and it would really mean a lot if you checked it out. It is for a great cause and is a great way to spread the word about mental health! Thanks!
