"What baby girl? I didn't hear you" He said nibbling on my earlobe sotly.
"I'm yours Seth" I said louder.
"Thats it baby. You're all mine!" His lips captured mine and I melted into the kiss making my heart flutter. God his kisses sent me through a loop. "I want you so bad Shea" He said resting his forehead against mine. Our heavy breathing mixing together.
"I want you too Seth, but we can't. Not yet" I said wrapping my arms around his neck and tangling my fingers through is soft silky hair.
"You really love my hair don't you?" He said with a chuckle.
"I do actually. Its really soft" He chuckled again and looked me in the eyes.
"Well I really like your eyes, hair, that beautiful smile, they way you blush, your face when your mad, the way your ass sawys back and forth when you walk. your cute dimples, your laugh, and god your just make me feel different. Iv'e never liked a girl as much as I like you Shea" He said giving me and eskimo kiss. I could feel happy tears filling my eyes. "Oh baby don't cry!" He said grabbing my cheeks in his hands.
"They're happy tears!" I said hugging him tightly.
"Babe relax" He chuckled hugging me closer.
"How could you be such a jerk to a total softy?" I asked smirking
"I don't know I guess you grew on me" He said kissing the top of my head.
"Hahaha good to know" I said hugging him tighter. I could hear is heart beating through his chest.

It was a peacfull sound to hear. "I can hear your heart Seth" I said out of the blue.
"It only beats for you beautiful" He said kissing the top of my head again. I just blushed.
"What are we going to do Seth" I asked the question we both knew we had to figure out.
"I don't know but I promise I will figure it out."
"Lets go somewhere" I said grabbing his hand.
"Where?" He asked with a chuckle.
"I don't know. Lets just drive somewhere. We have a couple days of summer left. Lisa is with your grandparents and your dads on buisness and my mom went on a spa weekend. C'mon!" I said pulling him.
"Woah. Hold up" He said stopping dead in his tracks.
"What?" I asked.
"Why did you jump on Casper earlier, well infront of me?" He asked. Really?
"Really Seth? Why does it matter?" I asked
"Because it does!" He said back.
"Seth lets just go" I said puling him. He pulled away his hand and looked at me.
"Why did you kiss him like that? Do you like him!? Do you actually have feelings for him?!" He asked raising his voice.
"NO!" I said.
"Well you don't just kiss someone like that!" He said angrily.
"SETH JUST DROP IT! IT DOESN'T MATTER!" I yelled.
"But it does! I don't want to date someone who is going to act like a slut all the time!" He screamed. I looked at him in disbelief and his face instantly softened. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I can't beliee he just said that. "Oh gosh I didn't mean that" He said walking over to me. I backed away and looked into his eyes.
