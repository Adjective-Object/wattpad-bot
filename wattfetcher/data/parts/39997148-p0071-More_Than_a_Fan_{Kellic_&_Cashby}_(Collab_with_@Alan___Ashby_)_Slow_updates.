"No this one is great. I like it now read to me." I demanded.
"Don't make me read it."
I pushed my bottom lip out, "Please?"
"Fine." He said sighing.
I smiled, "Now read it."
"Aust I can't do this." He said covering his face as he laughed, "It's too awkward!"
"Nope you wanted to read it. Now read it." I said wrapping my arms around him from behind and resting my head on his shoulder. "Read it."
He looked at me before back to the computer, "Where should I start the beginning or get right to it?"
"Just get right to it." I told him leaning back.
"Okay. Austin pulled the small ginger on top of him connecting their lips together. Are you sure? Austin asked him. Alan nodded and kissed the taller boy once more grinding their lower halves together." He stopped, "I'm not reading anymore unless you do."
I put a hand to my mouth trying to stop laughing, "I can't oh my god I'm done with this." I told him shaking my head.
"No you have to read some, please."
"Why!"
"Because I did. Now read some or I won't go on a date with you."
"Are you serious?" I asked sitting up.
"Completely. Now read some now."
"Fine." I grumbled and moved so that I could see the computer, "Alan gasped as he felt how hard Austin was as they grinded against one another. Austin pulled away from his ginger princess and smiled, Are you absolutely positive about this? He asked once more much to the gingers annoyance. Alan rolled his eyes and nodded, Just fuck me. He whined."  I stopped reading and looked over at Alan who was blushing more than ever. "You okay there?"
"Yep, but I think that's enough." He said shutting the computer.
"What's wrong I thought you wanted to see how they portrayed your cuteness or whatever?" I asked laughing a little.
"Well that's not cute."
"No that was fucking hot."
"What? That wasn't hot either."
"Oh that was definitely hot." I told him.
He shook his head, "I don't think so."
"Oh why not?" I teased, "Come on ginger princess I know you liked it."
"Ginger princess? No don't call me that." He said getting out of the bunk, "I'm gonna go get ready."
"Is that all you're going to do?" I asked laughing a little as he flipped me off. "Oh come on don't be like that."
He didn't say anything as he slammed the door shut. I climbed out of the bunk and went into the lounge with the rest of the guys.
"So how was the fanfiction?" Phil asked laughing.
"Very interesting," I told him and sat down. I watched them as they played their video game for awhile before heading back to my bunk and changing into something else. I grabbed my phone and saw a few missed calls, from Jaxin.
I sighed and went back out to the guys and soon enough Alan walked out dressed before walking over and sitting on my lap.
"Ready to go?" I asked and kissed his neck lightly before kissing him. He smiled into the kiss, kissing me back before pulling away.
