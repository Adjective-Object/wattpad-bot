Boo's POV
"Can you make me a snack?" I asked to Jordan.
"Sure, whataya want?" He asked me.
"Can you make me mac and cheese?" I asked.
"Yeah, sure." He said to me.
"SpongeBob ones?" I asked.
"No problem."
Erin's POV
I'm doing grocerie shopping and I get a text from Jordan.
"Is it ok if I make SpongeBob mac and cheese for Boo?" He asked.
"Sure, why not." I sent.
That reminded me to get more mac and cheese.
"K. When are you getting back?" He asked.
"In about 20 mins, Checking out now" I responded.
When I got back, they were eating SpongeBob and watching him.
"Hey!" He said before getting up and kissing me.
"Oh, hi." I said. I was surprised he was that excited I was back.
"Hi." He said as a small smile formed on him face.
"Hey, cheese mouth." I said as I wiped cheese from his upper lip.
"Oops, sorry." He said.
"Mommy, come watch!" Boo said.
"She cuddled me." Jordan said with a happy/sad face.
"Aww, she did?" I asked.
"Yeah." He said.
After about an hour, I decided to check emails. My phone was across the room, so I stood up, got really dizzy and fell on my arm.
"Shit!" I screamed as I fell.
"Mommy!" Boo yelled. She hates when I curse and I try not to in front of her.
"Jesus, Erin. Are you okay?" Jordan asked.
"Ow! Jordan!" I screamed. I started crying which made Boo upset and run to her room crying.
"Is it broken? You wouldn't know that yet. I hope you didn't brake it. Are you okay?" He asked.
"Jordan! Ow, yes... no." I said.
"I'm gonna get Boo and we can go to the hospital ok, I really hope its not broken." He said.
Jordan's POV
"Boo? Hey, we're gonna go to the hospital, get your shoes on please." I said.
"Okay." She said while crying.
"Boo, come here." I said. She ran to me and hugged me.
"I'm scared." She said.
"It's alright, were gonna get in the car and go." I said.
