"You know what f*ck you. F*ck all of you. You all need a reality check! Get your heads out of your asses and take a look at the real world!" I yelled as I walked off.
I heard one of the girls whispering bitchy things about me.
Oh well, oh well, guess I'll see them in hell.
I walked to the library and spent the rest of recess there.
The rest of the day passed by in a blur.
As I walked out of school I got a text from an unknown number.
'Hey photography girl'
Ohh I gave my number to the photography girl!
Me: 'That's ny nickname for you :('
Her: 'Your right I already know your name ;) Troy'
Creepy.
Me: 'How do you know that?' I asked
Her: 'When I opened the door I saw you :)'
Me: 'Oh so you wanna tell me your name?'
Her: 'nope ;)'
I decided not to reply.
I drove home and found a screaming Lillia sitting on the front door step.
"Lillia what's wrong?" I said as I rushed over to her.
"Mummy hit me!" She wailed.
"Okay baby stay here." I told her.
I walked inside and found wine bottles scattered throughout the house.
Oh no, mum's drunk again.
"Mum?" I called
She walked into the kitchen looking like a homeless woman.
"Have you been drinking again?" I questioned.
"Did Lillia tell you I hit her because I swear it was only a slap, or two, or three." She laughed.
"MUM! GET OUT NOW!" I screamed.
"No you get out." She sassed
"Fine. We will come back when you are sober." I said as I ran outside to get Lillia.
I lifted her up, walked into her room and told her to pack clothes and anything else she would need for a few days.
I walked into my room and packed a few pairs of jeans, some shirts and clean undies and bras.
I also picked up my deodorant, toothbrush and hairbrush.
After I was packed I walked into mums room and went to her bag and got around $500 dollars and walked back into Lillia's room.
She had her bag ready so we left.
We went to the local motel.
"A room for two please"
