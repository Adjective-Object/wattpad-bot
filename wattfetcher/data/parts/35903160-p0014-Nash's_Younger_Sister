I got up a few minutes ago and took a shower I'm wearing:‚Ä¢red dress‚Ä¢red vans‚Ä¢red glasses(usually wear clear contacts)I put my hair in a fish tail braid and go get Ava up but as usual she's all ready wearing:‚Ä¢Navy blue layered top‚Ä¢Coral shorts‚Ä¢Blue vansShe had a waterfall braid in her hair.I then spoke up,"Wanna go to Starbucks?"She replied,"Is that even a question?"We walked downstairs and I wrote a note 'At Starbucks be back around 12:45~Ava and Miaüôåüèª'I then grabbed 10$ and started walking with Ava to Starbucks.I order my usual a cotton candy frapp√© and Ava gets a Carmel frapp√©.I then notice a girl wearing:‚Ä¢strapless yellow shirt ‚Ä¢jean shortsShe had a fish tail brad like me but her hair was brown.I then told Ava,"I'm going to talk to her and get to know her." "Ok.I'll talk to her she said pointing at another girl,"Ava says.I walk over to the girl."Hi I'm Mia Grier,"I tell her."Hi I'm Kenzi,"she says."Hey you're related to Nash and Hayes.Well I'm 19 and my favorite MagCon guy is Cameron.You answered my question on your #AskM&A.My usernames @ilovemiagrier I asked you to sing.You were really good."I reply,"Thanks now I'm singing at MagCon."Ava's P.O.V."Hi I'm Ava Gilinsky,"I say."Hi I'm Justine,"she replies.Hey you're related to Jack Gilinsky.You and Mia are really pretty.My favorite guy is Hayes,"She says."Hey lets go meet Mia she's here.She's right there,"I say while pointing to her."Y'all are even more prettier in person,"Hi I'm Justine,"she tells Mia."Hey I have an amazing idea we go back to Mia's house,"I say."Yeah leggo."Mia says.We go straight to her house and enter.              Mia's P.O.V"THE QUEENS HOME BISHES!"I scream."Shut up the.......,"Cam trails off by looking at Kenzi and her face is red."Guys this is Justine and Kenzi.Kenzi is 19 and she likes Cam.Justine is 14 and she likes Hayes.Your welcome my fellow bishes,"I say."Now lets go get me ready for a date."The girls and I go up stairs and they pick out my clothes,do my hair,and do my makeup.I look really pretty.Shawn is just standing in awe.
