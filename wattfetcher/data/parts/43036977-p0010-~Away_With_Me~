(Danika)
I paced around Sly's room while he took all that I said in. "Come to the dining room you need to eat" he said I listen and followed I looked to the boy with the tattoo sleeve on his right arm. Eddie then took me to their kitchen he then started to make some scrambled eggs. I sat at the dining table rubbing my knuckles against my jaw subconsciously. My bike helmet next to me the boy with the tattoo sleeve walked in looking at me while he walked into the kitchen. After a while he came back out and was about to go into the living room. My phone rang I quickly picked up regretting it as soon as I did not knowing who it was.
"Hello Danika" he said "Where's Sherry?!" I asked angrily the boy with the tattoo sleeve turned to me."You shouldn't worry about her... She's no longer a thing" he said I could tell he was smiling by the way he sounded. I froze, my heart sinking in a black pond. I dropped my phone onto the table it bounced slightly then hit the floor not breaking but somehow hit the speaker button. The man laughed."You don't believe me do you why don't you come here yourself give it a long look... We even recorded the show for you" he said laughing his ass off.
Sly walked in looking at me concerned. I ran a hand through my hair. Tugging on my hair as I did so. I glared at my phone as if the man were there. I picked up my phone and threw it against the wall shattering and falling to the floor. "Goddamit!" I yelled as I fell to my knees as tears fell from my eyes. I pounded my fists onto the floor. Sly wrapped his arms around me. "Shh......" He whispered. I cried and hugged him back. "Sherry's dead... The motherfucker killed her" I whispered. Sly rubbed circles into my back. I didn't have my beanie on my ears had unflattened themselves awhile ago and now his friend seen my ears.
I stood up Sly helping me I wiped tears from my face I looked to his friend. His friend... Had ears.
