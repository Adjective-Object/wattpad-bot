Ian drives the blue car to the pizza place around the corner. I hold a fry in my hand as I slowly open my mouth.
I close my mouth and set the fry back in the container for later. "Hurry up Ian. I'm hungry."
The door opens and Ian has two boxes of pizza balanced on his left arm, as his right hand is clutching the golden doorknob.
"Finally, I was starving." I take the boxes out of his possessions and set them on the table.
"Go get the plates." I tell Ian. "Okay." He heads in a jogging manor to the kitchen and comes back into my bedroom and sets one for me and one for himself.
"Dibs on that piece!" I point to the biggest slice and immediately I rip it out off the circle.
"Really Anthony? Fine. Dibs on this piece." He pulls out the piece with the extra cheese and a huge bubble.
"Oh, I need to go back to the car. I bought Cream Soda and Mountain Dew. Come help carry it in."
I follow him to our blue car and I decide to carry in the Dew. "Ok, I got the Cream Soda." He races me into the kitchen but I win.
"Haha!" I laugh at him. He kicks my leg. "Ow! Ian!" I step on his foot and I run.
We finally finish the pizza and I put on the movie 'Old School'. "Oh, I watched this movie! Isn't this the one with Will Ferrell?" Ian asks, picking up the movie case.
"Yeah it is! Watch it yourself, I'm tired." I head to my room and I go to bed in my green and blue bed.
