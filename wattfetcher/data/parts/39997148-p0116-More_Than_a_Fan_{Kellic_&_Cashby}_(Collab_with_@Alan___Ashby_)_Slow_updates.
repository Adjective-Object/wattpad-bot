"Uh huh sure," I said just as we got to Alan. "Hey Alan."
"Hey guys." He said looking between us, "How's your day been?"
"Great! Vic took me out on a date to a science museum and they had this really cool planetarium dome full of all kinds of astronomy stuff you would have loved it!" Kellin told him grinning ear to ear.
"That's awesome."
"It really was, now what's up with you and Austin?"
"Nothing, everything is just fine. I gotta go."
"Are you sure?  Al it doesn't seem fine," Kellin said worry lacing his voice.
"People have relationship problems. It's normal."
"Yeah but-"
"Kells it's okay don't worry about it." He said cutting me off.
"Alan I'm gonna worry. I know you."
"Well don't. I'm going." He said and walked off.
Kellin sighed and I wrapped an arm around his waist, "Stop worrying Kells. He'll tell you when he's ready." I told him and kissed his cheek., "Don't stress about it."
"I'm not stressing."
"Yeah but I know you and you're going to stress about it until he tells you what's going on." I said and he nodded, "So instead of stressing you can come with me and bug the hell out of Jaime."
"I guess I can bug Jaime."
"Good cause I know how much you like pissing him off."
"You're right. Let's go bug Jaime."
I smiled and gave him a quick kiss before dragging him to the stage and he was right, it is fun dragging people.
Austin's Pov
"Finally." I said walking out of the venue. "Its the same questions every single time."
"Its an interview." Phil said.
"I know it is but it's always the same questions, what are you guys working on now? When can we expect some new music? How are your love lives? Is there a new song in the works?" I groaned, "It's annoying."
"Well get over it. It's going to happen whether you like it or not."
"All I'm saying is that they need to come up with new questions."
"One day they will Austin. One day." Aaron said patting my back.
"I just hope it's soon or else I just might go crazy."
The guys laughed.
"You're being ridiculous." Tino said.
"No I'm not." I said walking onto the bus, "You guys are."
"Dude what's wrong with you? You're being all pissy." Phil said.
"I'm not being pissy."
"Yes you are."
"What? No I'm not."
"Oh really?"
"No, why would I be?"
"Because you've complained about pretty much everything all day today and we all saw the way you were ignoring Alan earlier."
"I wasn't ignoring him."
"That's bullshit and you know it."
"No it isn't."
