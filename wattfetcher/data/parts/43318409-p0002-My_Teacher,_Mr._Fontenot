?: *Coughs* Um excuse me, I'm guessing this is yours? *He asks picking up the jacket*
Yn: *Nervously laughs, and looks up at mr.fontenot*
As Yn scarily looks up she instantly imagines Mr. Fontenot with his, shirt unbutton, his tie, and his belt around his neck, touching his hair and looking at her in a seductive, and sexy way. (The way he looks in the cover of the story) in this fantasy Yn doesn't realize she's looking deeply at Mr.Fontenot, looking at him like she wants to attack him (sexual way).
In reality Mr.Fontenot is looking at her in puzzling way.
Mr.Fontenot POV
Why is Yn looking at me in this way? I feel like she's not listening to a word that I'm saying. Is it even possible to think...that she is having a fantasy about me? But why? I'm not that attractive? Am I ? Don't get me wrong Yn is a very attractive girl, believe me I would definitely date her, and even do more than date her😏. Just thinking about it. The things I would do to her😉😏. But I need to stop thinking these dirty, and nasty thoughts about my students because if I don't I could loose my job😰😁.
Mr.Fontenot: *Coughs loudly* Yn. Yn. Yn. ....YN!! *he yelled to get her out of daze*
Yn: *Out of daze* huh? I'm sorry I was just day dreaming...🙊 sorry about that Mr. Fontenot .
Still Mr. Fontenot POV
Yeah, you better be sorry for pull out that leather on you girl!
Mr. Fontenot: Mhm, your okay baby girl just don't let it happen again or else...😏 *Evily smirks* but as I was saying, I was asking was this your jacket? *He asked pointing to Yn's jacket*
Yn: Yeah, it is I was looking for it. Thank you. ☺️. *She grabbed her jacket about to walk out the classroom* wait Mr. Fontenot let's say if I do daydream again what do you mean by "Or else " ?
Mr.Fontenot: Well let's just say if you do it again you'll find out *He winks* 😉. Have a nice day Yn.
Yn: *Blushing hard as hell* you too! ☺️
