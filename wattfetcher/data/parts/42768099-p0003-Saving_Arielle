"You don't ever learn do ya?"
Slap!
"Silly girl."
Slap!
"Such a stupid little worthless piece of shit."
Slap!
"You can't even take a slap right."
Oomph. The next hit took the breath out of me and I teetered precariously on my feet.
"Aw, c'mon girly, I barely even touched ya. Surely you can take more than that?"
Blam!
There was something wet dripping down my nose and the next thing I knew, I was seeing stars.
"What a waste of time. You can't even take a punch without fainting. Don't even deserve another one."
Thwack!
Some part of me hoped that I ended up like Arianna had, at least then all of this would be over and I wouldn't have to pretend not to care anymore. I pushed the thought away quickly, if I left then there would be no one around to take care of Sammy. I couldn't let that happen, no matter how bad the beatings got.
My stomach screamed in pain and then I toppled over, I couldn't bring my hands up fast enough and my face connected with the ground. Hard. It didn't matter, I was sure that my nose had already been broken. There wasn't all that much damage left to do.
"Fucking whore, no wonder you're such a weak little thing. You really do take after your momma after all. Don't cha?"
My head was spinning but I was almost certain that was spit I could feel on my cheek. It didn't matter any more because I was barely aware of what was going on. Soon he would leave, grab a beer from the kitchen and settle in on the couch to watch the game, leaving me here to fend for myself. I would be fine come morning, I always was. I had to be, for Sammy.
