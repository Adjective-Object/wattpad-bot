I turned the camera on to see the cap still on it. "O-oops! I g-guess we all make m-mistakes" I said as I took the cap off of the camera. H-hello. M-my name is J-Jenn! I'm auditioning f-for the new s-season of total d-drama. As y-you can t-tell i-i-i have a s-stutter. B-but that wont g-get in my w-way." "I m-may look weak b-but i can t-take a l-lot." M-my r-ramblings took up m-my minute s-so, B-bye!" I said. I ended the video and reluctantly sent it in  (or in better words, my sis sent it while i begged her not to.) Well, now all I can do is wait and see. (BTW, I'm 16, I have dirty blonde hair with natural highlights, I also have hazel eyes with specs of dark brown in them. Im REALLY geeky and nerdy and I love video games.I am also VERY shy.)
