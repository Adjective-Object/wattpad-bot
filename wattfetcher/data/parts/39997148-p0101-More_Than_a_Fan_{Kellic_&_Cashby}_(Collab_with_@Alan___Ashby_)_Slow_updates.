"You're the only person who's seen us." Austin said, "Now run along please."
Kellin rolled his eyes, "I'm not the only one." He said and shifted the box around to point to a group of girls who had their phones out. "And don't worry I'm going." He said smiling at us before he left.
"Austin!" I said pushing him away from me and blushing madly at the girls. "I should go..."
"No!" He said pulling me back to him, "Just a couple more minutes." He said hugging me.
"Babe we've got to go, the guys are going to be pissed with you."
"I haven't seen you all day though and when I did we argued and now we're here. Come on please?"
I sighed, "Okay fine but what about the girls..." I said looking over at them , "How did they get back here anyway?"
"Who knows, they probably snuck back here." He said, "Just ignore them."
"But what did they see, I mean... Austin we were practically fucking with clothes on."
"Babe it's fine we were just making out, who knows maybe they're going to make a fanfic out of this one day." He said and kissed me. " Just relax. " He said against my lips. I nodded and kissed him back, letting our tongues tangle together.
We finally pulled away just as Pierce's set ended.
"Aust you need to go before the guys murder you."
He sighed, "I know."
"Go, I'll see you later and I'll be right below you I won't be far."
He snickered, "Below me. Of course you will be." He kissed me once more before walking off to the stage.
I turned around and saw the girls still there giggling to each other.
"How much did you see of that?" I asked blushing, "I'm really sorry about that."
One of them grinned, "Oh we didn't see too much, and it's fine. Just know that Cashby fanfics don't do you guys justice."
"You read those?"
"Of course we do!" Another one said, "Who doesn't ship Cashby?"
"I don't know some people don't." I told them, "You guys didn't record anything did you? Or take pictures?"
"Just a few pictures- it was a nice talking to you!" One said and before I could say another word they were all running away.
I groaned before stomping off towards the stage just as the guys were getting on. I smiled at Austin who ran over and kissed me deeply before running on stage.
Their set went by quickly and I got quite a bit of pictures- mainly of Austin but I couldn't help myself. He was so hot jumping around on stage and these pictures had to be taken.
I finished up and quickly got backstage and looked for Austin. People were all over the place rushing around and when I found him I saw Jaxin standing with him. He was all over him and I couldn't help but be jealous except I was happy Austin was trying to push him away. I was torn on whether or not I should go over there and yell at him for messing with my boyfriend or just let Austin take care of it himself.
In the end I decided I wanted to to yell at the asshole for messing with my boyfriend.
"What the fuck are doing?" I yelled walking up to the two.
"What's it to you?" Jaxin asked rolling his eyes.
