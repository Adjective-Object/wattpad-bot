No two persons ever read the same book.
Imma talk about that.
OK some of you might not get it so lemme explain.
When you read you might see the book in a completely different way than someone else. This is where all our differences come from even though we read the same book.
In my opinion this is the most important part of reading. When you have a different opinion on something you'll have the most amazing conversations of your life.
You'll discuss so many things and you'll see things in a way that you never thought you would. You'll keep talking even long after you've gone off topic and all because you font see eye to eye.
You might have intense arguments and you might seriously disagree but when you look back at the conversation you can't help but be happy
Sorry if this was long as hell but i get like this sometimes sorry.
