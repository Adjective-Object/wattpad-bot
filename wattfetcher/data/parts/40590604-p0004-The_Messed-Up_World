Then it hit me on who that voice belongs too.
Will.
"Whatever, traitor." I spat at him.
"Nico, I'm sorry. It's just that I only like you as a bro. And I got Nyssa. I'm so sorry." He approached me.
"NO!" I yelled. "I am rejected again! And I'm pretty sure Reyna liking me is a lie! No one ever likes me! It's all a lie!" I stormed out of the room. Then suddenly........................
"NO! IT'S TRUE! SHE LIKES YOU!" A goddess voice screamed. It could only be the cruel goddess who strikes hearts. Aphrodite.
Then as if on cue, everything started floating up in midair. Like in outer space. Yes.
"That's it!" Annabeth said. "The key to bring peace to make love happy. The three of you have to find Reyna and fix that broken OTP. Aphrodite has messed up the world."
"It's just that," Piper began. "Beware. The girl swore on the Styx. Never to love again."
I had enough.
I just found my way to float back to my cabin. It now says in the prophecy even Reyna doesn't like me.
