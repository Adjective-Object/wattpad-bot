"(Name)...



(Name)...




(Name)...uhm, please wake up."




I felt my eyes slowly flutter open to see violet orbs gazing down on me. As my vision adjusted to the light, I realised that it was Canada.


"(Name), sorry to disturb your sleep, but I just wanted to let you know that we're back in the saferoom. Ah, but you may continue your sleep on the beds over there, eh?" the blonde haired Canadian said.


Looking at my current position, I became a little bit flustered. I realised that Canada was still carrying me in his arms. "O-Oh my! Thanks, Canada. You can put me down now..sorry for the bother." I told him.


He gently let me steady myself to stand on the wooden flooring of the room. "You're welcome. And no, it was not a bother at all. You looked really tired, so I'm glad you were able to take a break even for a while. You...were able to rest, right?"


"Yeah...why do you ask?" I tilted my head.


Canada furrowed his brows slightly and cupped his chin. "Well....you were sort of...sleep talking a while back."


"Wh-What?! I...didn't say anything inappropriate or anything.....did I?" I asked nervously.


He gave a soft chuckle and spoke, "No no. Just things like, 'mansion', 'time', 'cupcakes'..."


"....Ah...maybe I was getting a bit hungry from all the searching around the mansion and stuff ehehe..." I reasoned awkwardly.


Canada suddenly snapped his fingers and and faced me, "I remember some more you said....ah, what was it..? ...'hide-and-seek'--"


"--I-I think it was from my childhood memories or something. I, uh, tend to dream about those sometimes..." I told him, starting to cringe at the recollection of the dream I had just a while back.
