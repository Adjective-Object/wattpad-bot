I followed Tay to her All black Mercedes Benz with nice flashy rims on it
Miracle--- Damn you got a nice ass car
Tay---( Mean mugging me ) Listen ma you to beautiful to be cursing ight
Miracle---- ok w.e you say.... look At you over here talking to me like you my daddy
Tay--- Well that is what you gon be calling me soon so why not
Miracle--- (playfully punching her)
We arrived at my house and I welcomed Tay in
Miracle--- Here you pick out a movie and I'm going to put on some comfortable cloths on
Tay----
I went upstairs to change...... I put on some yoga and and a tank top on then went back downstairs to see Tay picked out Insidious 2 great
~~ Tay ~~
when Miracle came downstairs I couldn't help but stare at all her curves man this girl is just so Damn beautiful you don't even know the things I want to do to her I quickly snapped out of my daydreaming
Tay-- You ready for the movie ma
Miracle--- ugh ig
For most of the movie Miracle kept screaming and jumping so I eventually held her in my lap
Tay-- Come here ( pulling her to my lap)
Miracle---- (Blushing)
Tay---- I got you ok
Miracle---( nods her head)
I stared in her eyes and I'm not even going to lie it really had my thinkin if I was gon stop playing around and cuff her as I was staring into her eyes I couldn't help but kiss her
