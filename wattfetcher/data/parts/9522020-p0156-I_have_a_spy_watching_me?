He started to walk off and I went on.
"So, you and her having a project and you trying to act cool is nothing. You stammering on your sentences is totally normal, Right?"
He completely froze then.
"Do it, you'll only be doing me a favor." He said and turned giving us a mock salute as he went on.
"He's telling the truth, anyways you should wake Jaycie." Morse said just as we heard footsteps running out of Jaycie's room.

*Jaycie's POV*
"NO! GET AWAY! GET THAT CURSED THING AWAY FROM ME! YOU LIED! I SAID NO!" I yelled as I ran away from Tessa and Tania.
"Jaycie, come on, do it for me!" Tessa begged as she followed after me.
"NEVER! I HATE THAT CRAP! NO! NO! NO! NO! AND NO!" I yelled as I slid down the banister to get away from her. I landed perfectly fine and smiled and waved to Morse and Chase to only see her coming down making me gasp as I ran outside.
"JAYCIE! COME ON!" She yelled after me.
"NO! Not today or tomorrow, I am done with make up and that is finalllll... Hi Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil, Claire, Tyler and you guys... How are you?" I asked as I showed a smile.
Mom laughed a little along with Mrs. O'Neil.
"You know you should get used to make up. It makes women and young ladies like you look prettier." Mrs. O'Neil says.
"She is beautiful so are you Mom, I don't know how many times I have to say that. You don't need make up to look pretty when you are already beautiful." Chase said as he came out.
I tried not to blush as I stuck my tongue out at Tessa.
"See! I don't need it." I said as I went to sit down to only be hugged. I looked and saw Jack and Nick. I froze. "Nick, Jack what, you didn't tell me he was in town." I said looking at him.
"I didn't know until now. He wanted to say hi." Jack said after I hug him.
"I heard what happened and came as soon as I heard which was last night. I'm glad you are all safe." He said hugging me and I hugged him back.
"Thank you. Anyway, everyone this is Jack and Nick. They are friends of mine." I said.
"Anyway, I'm Chase, Jaycie's boyfriend. It's nice to meet you." Chase said extending his hand out to shake hands.
Nick was somewhat surprised, but smiled anyway.
"It's nice to meet you as well. I'm Nick, an old friend of hers."
"Yeah, how long ago? How'd you meet her?" Chase asked and I elbowed him.
"We met a year ago anyway I'd actually need to talk to Chase for a second so if you'll excuse us." I said as I tried to tug him away to only have him rooted to the ground.
"Talk about what?" He asked with a smile.
"You know you would know if you came with me. Skull!" I yelled. "Get. him. to. move."
I was practically trying to get him to move. When he finally did he picked me up surprising me.
"Stop it!" I laughed, but then he made me fly in the air a bit. I choked back a scream as I grabbed onto him. "You jerk! I'm going to hurt you!"
I laughed and smiled as he smirked.
"Oh yeah?" He asked as he carried me in. "Hurt me how?"
