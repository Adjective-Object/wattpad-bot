"Yeah. So what did you call me for?"
"Oh, yeah. Jesse hangs out with you a lot, right?"
Oh no, was the first thought that ran into my brain after she mentioned Jesse. She wants me to ask him out for her, I thought.
"Yeah..."
"Ok. So, I've been liking him for a while now and I want to ask him out. Will you help me out?" Lily pleaded.
"Um... I don't know."
"Please, Charlie? I know you're not into all that girly stuff. That's why I'm asking you to help me. Please?"
"Um... Okay. I'll help you."
"Yay! Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Lily screamed as she pulled me into a tight hug. I hugged her back before releasing myself out of the hug.
"Okay. I have to go. Bye." I waved as I ran to the bus and hopped on the steps.
"Bye." Lily waved back.
The bus dropped off many students at their houses before reaching mine. I hopped down the steps and walked to my house as the bus drove away. I unlocked the front door and found my mom and Logan in the living room.
"Hello, Charlotte." Mom called out.
"Hi, Mom." I called back. "Sup, little bro?"
"Sup, big man?" Logan called back.
"How was school?" Mom asked.
"It was okay." I lied.
"Hey, Charlie. Dad called earlier and asked for you." Logan said.
I froze up when Logan mentioned Dad. I don't really talk to him and I haven't seen him in a while. I barely talk about him anywhere. He rarely calls because he's too busy with his new family to care about his real one, so I was really shocked to find out that he actually called.
"Did he want to tell me anything?" I asked.
"Yeah. He told me to tell you that he loves you and he can't wait to see us." Logan answered.
"Really? He said that? I thought he was too busy to care about us." I said. "I thought he loved his new family and not us."
"Charlotte Jewel Red!" Mom yelled as she stood up from the couch. "You do not talk about your father like that!"
I came up to her. We were just a foot away from each other. "Why do you say that like it's a bad thing?" I whispered.
"Because it is. I know that you haven't seen him in a few years, but that doesn't mean that you have to talk trash about him." Mom replied.
I stepped closer to her so that we were face-to-face. "So now you're taking his side?! He cheated on you for 2 straight years! He never talks to you nor mentions you!" I shouted. "Do you still love Dad?!"
"Of course I do! But not like that!" Mom screamed.
"Sure, mother! Well, news flash: He doesn't love you!"
"Charlotte! Stop acting like a devil!"
"I don't care! He doesn't love any of us! He just doesn't want us to think any less of him!"
"Woah, Charlie. Calm down." Logan interrupted. He stood up and tried to use both his hands to touch my shoulders. I pushed them away.
"No, I won't!" I turned back to Mom. "Stop defending Dad! He has a new life now that doesn't involve us!" I ran upstairs and slammed my door shut. I sat next to my bed and thought about how rotten my life is.
