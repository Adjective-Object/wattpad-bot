"The cave does something to its residents....I feel like it corrupts us. A water drop hits the floor, its sound echoing off the walls. Every paw step sounds as loud as thunder. I flinched as Scorchstar padded into the cave. I could never meet my eyes with my brother's. He corrupted himself, and now tries to do the same to his Clan."~Silverwing
