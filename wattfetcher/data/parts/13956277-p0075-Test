Okay, so, I have to make a scedual right now:
#1 Im going to give away everything in the closet- WAIT A SECOND !! THIS JERK THREW ALL MY OLD CLOTHES ! WHAT AM I GONNA WEAR THEN ?!? I'll solve this later ...
#2 To the pet store to find out who bought me this kitten, clothes, chocolate, windows and stalks me.
#3 Do what I said in #1 and #2
#4 I should heal my leg to accomplish #3.
"WHAT THE .." Mrs.Carter scanned me.
"She jumped out of the window" Damon said simply, he wants me to get scolded.
"SHE WHAT !!!!"
"Calm down Mrs.Carter I'm fine, I still can walk, just give me some bandages and ice"
"The cups didnt work ?" Damon looked offended.
"Ice in a thick plastic cup will never work" Elina chuckled.
.....
I wrapped the bandages around my ankle, got upstairs, brought all the things in plastic bags, then I got back down.
A piece of clothes slipped from the bag, Stylish & modest, That's what it said. Weird...
I scanned all the clothes and found something strange, They all were from Stylish & Modest. The dresses, Hijabs, boots and accessories, all of them from the place I work in.
"C'mon Elina" I opened the door with my chin since both of my hands were busy.
"And you think I'm gonna let you go with this ankle ?" Damon tries to act like a man and be jealous and all ... But dis ain't gonna work wid me babe.
.......
Heyyyyy

So yeah, That's what I wanted to say.
