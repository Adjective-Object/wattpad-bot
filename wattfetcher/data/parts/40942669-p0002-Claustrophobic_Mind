"I'm not insane!" Billie shouted.
"Billie Joe, sit down," Tré spoke while his hands rested on Billie's shoulders.
Look! Even Tré thinks you're crazy. He said so himself! Just admit it Billie Joe, you're nothing.
Billie shook his head.
"I'm just trying to help you Billie. Talk to me!"
He's not trying to help you for your safety. He only wants you to calm down so he can carry on with Green Day. He only cares if you're okay because he wants it for the money.
Billie shook his head.
"Do you want me to get Mike?"
Don't listen to him. He doesn't care. He doesn't care about you either, he just wants the fame.
"S-Stop..." Billie Joe choked out.
"Billie Joe? Can you hear me?!"
He's going to tell everyone.
Billie gritted his teeth.
"BILLIE!"
You can't escape me Billie. I'm in you're head. And eventually...you're going to die because of me.
"No!"
"Billie Joe!"
Tick tock. It's just a matter of time.
Billie Joe fell to the ground and pulled himself into a ball. He cried and shook while Tré desperately called his name. He could barely hear him over his cries and the voice in his head. Billie didn't want this. He didn't want to be crazy. He didn't want to have to share his thoughts. He didn't want a claustrophobic mind.
"Billie?"
Billie didn't respond to Tré, but he did crawl into his arms. Tré wrapped himself around Billie and held him close. Billie Joe's cries soon died down, leaving him with sniffles and dried tears.
Tré didn't sleep that night, for he was afraid for Billie Joe. What was happening to him?
A faint snore came from the small man. Tré instinctively played with his soft hair and wiped away the remaining tears in his face. A shiver came from Billie Joe followed by a few incomprehensible mumbles.
Tré stayed as still as possible, trying his hardest not to wake the man. He didn't want to disturb the sleep that Billie was finally enjoying. After all, Billie hasn't slept in days.
