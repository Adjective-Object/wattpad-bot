There's days when I want To stand under the hard spray of water,Feel the blistering heat pierce my bodyAnd try to warm my heartSomehow.
To feel it beat, beat, beatAgainst me as it slowly turns to Icy cold.
Because some days it's like a tidal waveSweeping over and carrying me underSuffocating and drowning meUntil there's nothing left
Other days it leaves me whole,As whole as I can possibly beLike this,
A cracked remnant of a soul Lost to the worldOf light.
