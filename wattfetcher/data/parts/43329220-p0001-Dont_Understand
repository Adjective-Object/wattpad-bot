I'm the saddest person but the happiest Do you understand? I'm so emitional yet emotionless Do you understand? No you couldn't You see I'm a mystery You could dig up all my history But still couldn't understand me That's how it'll always be If you could read my mind That would be the key I'm the most complex yet simplex person you'll ever meet I'm very out going yet so shy I'm so insecure but still think I'm so fly I'm nice but so mean I'll hit you with a bye I love life but yet wanna die Do you understand? No you couldn't I'm misunderstood Couldn't figure me out Not even by my mood But I wish you could
