I: Anthony, are you okay?
I: You seem a little down.
I: And I mean that in both ways.
A: Not really.
I: What's wrong, dude?
A: I miss Pip...
I: Oh, Anthony, i'm so sorry...
A: It's fine. It was his time. I just wish I could have told him i loved him one last time before he died.
I: I know how you feel, man. Remember when Sparky died?
A: Oh yeah. You cried for a week straight.
I: That I did, but I eventually got over it. Well, sorta. I got my dog Daisy a couple years later. She doesn't replace Sparky, but fills a part of the hole that he left.
A: Let me guess. I fill another part of that hole?
I: You do. In more ways than one.
A: ;D
I: So, to help fill the hole Pip left, do you want to get another kitten?
A: You would do that for me?
I: Yes I would, because I love you <3
A: I love you too <3
I: But we're not naming it Pip 2.0
A: Fine.
