The bell for Period 3 had just rang. I opened my dark blue 'Just Do It' bag and pulled out my planner. I was hoping for a good lesson but no. English. I guess English isn't that bad? Okay it is terrible. I stood there for a good few minuets trying to pursued myself that English isn't the worst lesson in the world. I hadn't realised the time and that I only had two minuets to get to lesson, English was on the third floor."CHRISS!" A shiver shot straight up my spine as two cold hands clenched onto my shoulders, A strong strawberry sent filled the air. Only one person ever did that, My best mate Phil."Hey man, were you been at." I asked happly but annoyed at the same time. He knows I don't like him doing that but yet he still does."Err, Chris hello? We got English?! With MS KAL! No time for chit chat, Ms Kal is actually gonna kill us if we don't get there in what? Thirty seconds?!"Phil blurted out, he was out of breath. I knew he was right, he's always right. I grabbed my bag of the bench and stuffed my planner away. I quickly zipped up my bag and threw it on my back. I look down at my 'Armani' watch, twenty seconds. We ran through the building like little kids again. Racing as we went. Usually I wouldn't care if I'm late for lessons but when it comes to English with MS KAL. You don't want to be late. We ran up three flights of stairs, I was out of breath at the second. Phil could see I was out of breath. I have very bad Asthma and cannot run for very long. Phil could see this so he picked me up and put me on his back. He carried me all the way to the top of the stairs, I gained my energy back and jumped of his back. We swung the door open of our English classroom. "Chris and Phil, late as usual. Half an hour detention." Ms Kal said not looking at us. WHAT? I thought. I wasn't in the moode to argue back so I just strolled towards my seat and slumped down onto it. I pulled out my 'Pink' English book. I looked over to the far right. Something caught my eye. I looked back. A new student? She had beautiful long brunette hair. She was wearing bright PINK lipstick. A bit too bright for my liking. But yet there was still something about her. I couldn't see her eyes. She was wearing white sunglasses. I recognised her from somewhere. But where?"AHH, students. If you haven't noticed already we have a new student. Lydia?" Ms Kal looked over to the girl with the long brunette hair signalling for her to get up. She stood up and walked to the front of the class. She was wearing neon pink high hills which gave her, her height. As she walked she gave the class a quick smile then pulled of her sunglasses. Lydia? Lydia? Were have I heard that name before? Questions filled up my mind. But I couldn't put my finger on it. Who is she? Where have I seen her before? "Oh YES, I know!" Everyone turned around to look towards me, oops.
