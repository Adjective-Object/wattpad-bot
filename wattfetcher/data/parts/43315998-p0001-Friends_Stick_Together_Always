~Aubrey's POV~
Aubrey-"Lythia lets go, you don't wanna be late do you?!"
Lythia-"I'm coming, I'm coming"
Aubrey-"....."
Lythia-"What?"
Aubrey-"It's our first day at college"
Lythia-"Yeah I know, were not late"
Aubrey-"I know but I like to be early"
Lythia-"Lets go then"
Aubrey-"Alrighty then"
Lythia-"College here we come"

When we arrive at the college me and Lythia are just flooding with questions!

Aubrey-"It's so pretty! I can't wait to see what the inside looks like!"
Lythia-"It's just looks so sophisticated, doesn't it?"
Aubrey-"It does! That's probably because its an Ivy league school!"
Lythia-"Your totally right!"
Aubrey-"Well duh, I'm always right!"
Lythia-"Haha, not all the time you know"
Aubrey-"Okay, tell me one time when I was wrong"
Lythia-"I'll let you know soon enough"

We then try to find our dorm room. Lucky for us were in the same room!

Lythia-"It's SO BIG!!"
Aubrey-"Okay Lythia calm down!"

Lythia's version of big is about a 30 square foot bathroom... I'm not saying this college Isn't big cause let me tell ya It Is! It's just not surprising to me.

Veronica-"Hi my name is Veronica, are you two by any chance Aubrey, and Lythia?"
Lythina-"I'm Lythia!"
Aubrey-"Yup and I'm Aubrey nice to meet you Veronica!"
Veronica-"Not to be rude but it seems we have a energetic, happy, sweet, pretty Lythia here. And then we have a kind, pretty, caring yet serious Aubrey here. What do you think do I have that right?"
Aubrey-"Well I would say so but I'm only serious at times"
Lythia-"Well you got me right!"
Veronica-"Of course, sorry, why don't I show you two to your dorm"
Aubrey/Lythia-"Thank You!"

(Really?! I'm not serious! What is she talking about?!)
*****

Veronica-"Well here we are room 35A"
Aubrey-"Thanks so much!"
Lythia-"Yes thank you!"
Veronica-"If you need anything just give me a call"

She gave us her number and walked away
