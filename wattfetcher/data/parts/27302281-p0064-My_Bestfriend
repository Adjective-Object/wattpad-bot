" your not leaving me even if I have to force you to stay I know you don't want this I know you don't wanna leave" I said breathing in her neck
" please don't leave me " I pleaded digging my face in her neck
" Justin I have no choice" she said trying to convince me like she didn't want to stay but I knew she did
" its over okay move on " she said walking off leaving my grip I ran up behind her and pinned her to the wall in front her making her face me
" don't you ever say that to me again OK " I breathed down her neck and started my descent she put her hand up
" we aren't dating anymore " she smirked
" shut up " I said pushing her hand out the way then kissing her
" if I only have five days then those will be the best five days of my life"I smiled kissing her again
" you piss me off "she smirked shoving my chest playfully
" I love you" I smiled
" hate you too" she teased
" love you more " I chessed then we walked downstairs.
"I'm not doing that sappy stuff " she mocked
