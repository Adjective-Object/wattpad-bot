"Why the hell am I doing this?" Sakura asked herself looking at herself in the mirror.

One would say it was classic, weren't for the fact that the skirt was extremely short and it showed most of cleavage.

It was a plain black tank top which exposed her entire back and the only part that was skirt was the mini apron that seemed to dangle from the shirt and onto the already short skirt. The skirt seemed to literally end, 5 inches below her waist line.

"I know it's ad but you can't complain. It's our turn today." Aya answered not feeling too happy about the deception and hypocrisy behind the job.

"It was all your idea!"Sakura shouted.

A few weeks ago....

Aya and Sakura were walking through the halls when they saw a colourful advertisement.
'Help wanted for the School's Maid Cafe. Please send in your application the FablousPinkFluff@WLord.com'
"What's this one about?" Sakura asked.
"Well the schools owns a Maid Cafe which is run by Hancock-chan."
"That greedy bitch actually owned something?" Sakura asked in surprise earning a slap from Aya.
"Yeah, but I heard all the maids quit their job. I wonder why?"
"That email address looks funny. We shouldn't sign up."
"Of course, we should!"
"Why?"
"Because the poster is pink!"
"That's not a good enough reason!"
"Plus, I'm pretty sure Kid will be there." Aya said teasingly.
"I don't give a damn about that bastard!"
"But Ace goes there too."
"Yosh, what was email address again?"
"That's the spirit!"
-
"I am so going to kill Doflamingo." Aya hissed.
"Get over it." Nami scolded, "We have work to do."

After lining up in front of the door, they all greeted.

"Welcome home, master~"

-Doing a time-skip because a Yonko told me so~-
Reflecting, the current owner's likes, the cafe was very spacious. The entire cafe's floor was tiled with white marble and it shone, literally. The walls were white with occasional pink stripes running diagonally. From the ceiling, hung pink glass lanterns which gave off a faint glow.
There were 20 seats, each had a centre table with a number, which served the purpose of letting the customer know which maid they were getting.
There were 5 maids, namely: Aya, Sakura, Vivi,Nami and Robin.
Aya served Tables 4,8,12 and 16.
