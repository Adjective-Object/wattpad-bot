I know,that I can't make you stay,but where's your heart?
when will you go? baby by the time you get back I'll have already gone on my way.
would you even turn to say goodbye? could you look at me and tell me your gone?after all the blood I've shed when you go, I won't cry.
I know there's nothing I can say to change that part I am not afraid to walk alone baby if you stay you'll be forgiven
if you go, take my pictures with you. look at them when your alone show your new friends and don't come back.
