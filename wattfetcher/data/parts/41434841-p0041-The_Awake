I don't even know. It's like I have two different people battling in my head. My headache is getting worse. I'm on some sort of emotional roller coaster. One moment I'm making a plan for life and then next I'm looking up the statistics for suicides. Idk. My higher power is correct. I am scared of dying. Just. I don't know what comes after. But I don't want to know the future. With my luck more people will leave me. Ryan won't want me back. Just none of this is how things are supposed to be. As far as I was aware I was supposed to get "better" and then find my way back in. Take the complete opposite of that. That's what's going on right now. And it's just super.
