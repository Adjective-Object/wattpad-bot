T-"hello"
S-"t-tristen"
T-"im on my way"
*End Of Phone Call*
-5 minutes later-
"im here!" tristen opens the door to my room.
she runs up to me and hugs me.
"babe...whats wrong?" she asks......and here come the tears.
"me and jack.......were done" i say through tears.
"what happened hun?" she asks rubbing my back. "he got mad because i might leave to college in LA" i said wiping my tears.
"why did he get so mad about it?" she asks. "because i was leaving him" i said.
"just forget about him babe...i brought you ice cream, swedish fish, and hot funnyns!" she said pulling out a bag from behind her back.
"your an amazing friend tristen, i dont know what i would do without you" i say hugging her.
"thats what im here for!" she says with a big cheeky smile.
we laugh.__________________
"you know guys....i really needed this" i said taking another hit.
"we know you did bro....so when do you think all of this will blow over?" sammy asks.
"to be honest, im still pissed!"i said.
"what college did you say she was going to again?" johnson asked
"Fucking UCLA!" i say. "but right now, i dont need her...she wants to leave me, she can leave me...i dont need her" i say laughing. "she is a bitch!"
"Hey bro we have been smoking for 3 hrs. now , your really high, you cant drive, stay here" johnson says. "thanks bro" i say patting his back.
"umm....gilinksy im sammy"..."no your not your johnson!" i say. "alright bro you need sleep" i feel hands on my shoulders helping me walk.
then i fall on to something, which im assuming is a couch, and pass out._____________________-First Day Of Senior Year-
"hey johnson whats your first period?" i ask. "umm...choir, what about you?" he asks. "same".
we head to first period. on our way there i see tristen and sabrina at their lockers , i look at her and she looks at me, i look away.
yes, me and her are still not talking, im pissed and i probably will be for a while, i dont want her leaving me. she knows i love her.
(A/n: everyday they make vines im just not gonna write about them, just thought i'd let you know!)
we get to choir and take a seat in one of the chairs. a few minutes later, tristen,sammy, and sabrina walk in. great.
sammy come and sits with us , while tristen and sabrina sit somehwere else.
im gonna make sabrina jealous......show her what she is missing out on.
"hey leigh!" i kind of yell across the room. she turns around and walks over. "wanna sit over here, next to me?" i say winking.
she sits down ,i wrap my arm around her and she snuggles in my side...leigh is my ex.
i glance at sabrina and she's looking at me.
