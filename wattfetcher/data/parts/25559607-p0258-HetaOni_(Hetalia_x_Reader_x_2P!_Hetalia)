///Reader's PoV///



"It won't eat...It obstinately refuses to. Since we went through all the trouble to bring it food, should we force it to eat?" I heard Japan ask.




England eyed the AmeriMochi curiously.  "Maybe the food is too good for it to take? America, didn't you bring anything else?"





"What, you mean inside my hero pockets...? All I have is withered/raw cabbage." America answered, showing them a piece of the vegetable.




We were all gathered in a room in the fourth floor. Japan, America and England were trying to solve how they can get the AmeriMochi out of the hole on the wall. The others were scattered about the room, chatting and making small talk to pass time as the three were in charge of the mochi. I, on the other hand, was just standing on the far lower right of the room, by myself.




It's not that I'm still uneasy about the others and vice versa...we've already worked it out. It's just that...I've been thinking...




I've been thinking about the 2Ps.




Okay, I know that I'm supposed to be really furious about them about what they did--and maybe I still sorta am...but...but...

What Japan said, really got me thinking.




It's true, to be honest, they haven't really tried to kill me or anything. They lied, yes.
Their lies hurt my feelings--not to mention my head. Seriously, I've had so many mental struggles just because of that lie. ....But, they've somehow become my friends... Ollie, for example. And...they have...shown..."concern". I still don't want to admit it, but I think Luciano meant that.
