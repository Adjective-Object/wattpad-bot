How you meet-
Dean- You stood in the market just staring at the empty shelves. You sighed and turned around to meet green eyes staring at your (e/c) eyes. "Can I help you? Because I don't work here." You said. He stayed quiet for a minute before responding. "You've been staring at that empty shelves for the past 7 minutes. Can I ask why?" He had a deep voice. You smiled at the man. "Some dude took the last pie and I kinda stand here till they put more out." You explained. The man reach down into his basket. And handed you the pie. "Here, I can find another." You stared at him. "Your lying." He smirked. "Alright! I do love me some pie. How about we split it half the pay and you take half of it. Deal?" You nodded. "Fine. By the way I'm (y/n)." You stuck your hand out. "Dean. Dean Winchester."
Sam- You weren't tall. So when you are at the library or book store- since you almost always there- you try and avoid for books out of your reach. However, there is one book you always wanted and you couldn't reach. You huffed in frustration. You looked up and saw a hand grabbed the book. You turned around and saw a tall man with long hair. He passed you the book. "Here, I saw you struggling to reach for this." You went red. "Well, yeah. I'm not the tall. Wait how long have you been watching?" This time he went red. "A few minutes." You rose an eyebrow. "Seriously dude! I could have gotten that book a few minutes ago!" He looked at you with puppy eyes. You sighed. "Thanks...?" You stopped realising you didn't know the mans name. "Sam Winchester." You nodded. "I have to go and meet my brother. See you around.." He turned around. "THE NAME IS (y/n) BY THE WAY." As you waved good bye.
Castiel- You sat at the edge of the roof. Not because you wanted to commit suicide. No, it because you loved the view. You could see the city. There was a man watching you and you could feel his stare. "Are you going to stand there? Or would you like to join me?" Of course you were taking a risk, I mean this man could be a murderer. You heard footsteps and then at the corner of you eyes you saw him sit down. "Beautiful ain't it just?" You asked, being friendly. He nodded. "Very." He replied. After a few minutes of peaceful quietness. You sighed. "You don't talk much." You turn to see a man in a trench coat and he had bright blue eyes. You felt a small smile creep into you face. "It doesn't matter. I hope I see you again... Wait whats? Your name?" He looked at you. "Castiel." Your eyes shined. "Nice name Castiel. My name is (y/n).
Gabriel- You worked at the bar. Many men has flirted with you but you always say the strippers are on the right which they always seem to go. You aren't a stripper or a pole dance. You were the bartender. So usually you have to make sure no person was left out with a drink. But this man was different. "Can I help you?" You asked a handsome man. His eyes were golden and you were very attracted to them. "No, but can I help you?" You rolled your eyes. "You know the strippers are on the right?" You asked as he chuckled. "Yes but I don't want them. The names Gabriel." You stared at Gabriel. "And my name is (y/n). You are are the first man who actually don't want strippers." He chuckled once more. "Because I want you. See you another time, (y/n)." And then he disappeared.
Balthazar- You worked at the museum. You locked up late but you didn't leave. You knew something or someone was stealing things. You heard a noise and turned around. It was dark. But since your eyes has already got use to the dark, you could see. You saw a man trying to steal a crown. You couldn't really see what he looked like but you just started at him. You were leaning on your desk. He turned around and grinned at you. Since you were up on the second floor he looked up at you. "How long have you been watching?" You shrugged but you noticed he had a british accent. "Few minutes." He flashed next to you. You shrugged it off. "Wine?" You offered as you pour yourself one." Please." You poured him one and passed it to him. "Thank you... You are very welcoming and beautiful, love." You shrugged and blushed at the same time. "I have a blade in my drawer, try to attack me I can stab you." He laughed. "Angelic I think." You said as he stopped laughing. "Well, thank you. I'll make sure I won't steal anything from you but I will visit. Don't miss me too much" You smirked. "My name is Balthazar, how about you, beautiful?" You chuckled."(y/n). The names (y/n)." He kissed the back of your hand before disappearing in thin air.
