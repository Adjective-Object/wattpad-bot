My dad half-slides-half-dives into the room, crashing in between the counter and island and kneeling at my side. "What happened?" He asks, every ounce of seriousness seeping into his voice.
"I'm fine." I try to act collected. "It was an accident, I just dropped the glass."
"Are you hurt?" He asks, his eyes flickering to the shattered glass on the ground.
My brain scoffs at the question. Apparently Not.
