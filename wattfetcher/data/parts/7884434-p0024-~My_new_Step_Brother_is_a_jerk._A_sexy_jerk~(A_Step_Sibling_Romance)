Chapter 8
Shea's P.O.V
I could not believe what Casper had just done, and to his best friend. I turned to him and smacked him.
"Your a jackass! I did not agree to go on a date with you!" I screamed at him.
"Sweety you said you'd give me a chance" He said with a smug grin.
"No anymore! And how could you be so crule to him! He's your bestfriend!" I yelled
"Used to be! He gets every fucking girl he wants! So now i'm going to take the one that means the most to him!" He yelled.
"Oh no you fucking won't!" I said shoving him. "I will never be yours! Your an asshole! Get out!" I yelled opening the front door.
He looked at me with a blank expression on his face. "I will be back for you Shea!" He left the house slamming the door behind him.
Seth
I ran upstairs and to his room. I knocked on the door millions of times before it swung open. I looked at Seth, his cheeks were puffy, his eyes watery, his face a pink color from crying.
"Oh Seth" I said resting my hand on his cheek.
He pushed my hand away. "Leave me alone Shea. Have fun with Casper" He said closing the door. I did what I had to do. I jumped on him making him crash to the floor.
I was laying ontop of him and he looked pissed. "WHAT THE FUCK!" He yelled.
"Seth let me explain" I said softly resting my head in the crook of his neck. I could feel his heart beat rapidly. I kissed the soft skin on his neck gently. "Casper lied to you Seth. I didn't agree to anything. Yes I said I would give him a chance but I didn't say when. I still need to get over you first. It's going to take a while" I kissed up his neck loving the sound of the throaty low moans that I was causing him.
I kissed up his neck and across his jaw, until I reached the side of his mouth. "Do you forgive me?" I whispered softly. "Please say you'll forgive me. I won't be able to deal with you bei-" He pressed his finger to my lips silencing me.
His hands then wrapped into my hair, as he pulled my lips down to his. His soft lips against mine made my heart beat rappidly, my stomach fill with butterflies who gave birth to more butterflies, who then gave birth to more butterflies. I couldn't understand why he had this affect on me. It was such an amazing feeling coarsing through my body.
He flipped us over so he was hovering over me. I wrapped my legs around his waist and pulled him closer to me. I rested my hands on his chest. He puled away and rested his forehead against mine. "I forgive you Shea, but never let me see you in his arms again. It kills me" He whispered. I pecked his lips once more gently and then looked into his beautiful eyes.
"What are we going to do Seth? Expecially when school starts in a couple days" I asked softly.
"I don't know. We can just not tell people we are soon to be step-siblings" He said softly looking into my eyes.
"Seth I don't want to lie to everyone and then get caught. I don't want to be frowned upon cause I am dating someone. We have to keep it a secret" I said
"I don't want to keep you a secret Shea. I want everyone to know you are mine" He said softly in my ear making me shiver. Just him calling me his makes my heart flutter. "Tell me your mine Shea. Let me hear it roll of your tongue" He said kissing the soft spot under my ear.
"I'm yours" I said breathlessly.
