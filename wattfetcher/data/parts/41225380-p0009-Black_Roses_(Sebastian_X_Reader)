Sebastian covered his mouth and began to laugh. I stared blankly at him as he tried to hold back laughter.
After what seemed like hours, he cleared his throat and smirked at me.
"I find that hard to believe. If you could fight, why didn't you escape yourself?" He held in more laughter
My eyes narrowed and I crossed my arms. "I was locked in handcuffs."
"That may be true, but they weren't connected to the cage."
"The damn cage Was locked!" I snapped back.
Sebastian grinned in response. Tch. He was teasing me.
"Besides," I said. "I didn't have any knives." I smirked devilishly at him.
His joking expression changed to a slightly confused look. "Knives?"
"That's my speciality."
The butler nodded and thought for a moment. He told me to wait for him to return, and I did. Sebastian returned with several silver knives in his hand. He handed them to me and I examined them closely. Sharp, shining, new knives.
"Throw them at me." I glanced up at Sebastian, completely baffled.
He looked unfazed at his current situation.
'He must have some sort of trick.'
I shrugged and took my throwing stance.
Aiming at Sebastian's head, I threw a knife as hard as I could. The silver knife darted towards his forehead.
Sebastian caught the knife with two fingers. It was almost touching his forehead. I dropped the knives and my (E/C) eyes widened in shock.
He dropped the knife and gave me a seductive smile. "I underestimated you."
"So did I."
