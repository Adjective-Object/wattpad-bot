Please tell me if you see any mistakes!Â (Like, a lot of times I would write "her" instead of "him" or vice versa, and I usually miss it :/)
P.S. Jared's pic is to the right...he's too cute!
P.P.S. I'll admit, "Roar" is pretty mainstream, but I feel like it goes really well with Zoe's thoughts...at least, the lyrics do. xD
