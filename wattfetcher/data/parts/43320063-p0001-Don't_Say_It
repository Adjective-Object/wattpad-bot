Have you ever thought that your not good enough,smart, pretty, skinny, and will be a loner forever.
That what I thought when I was crowned Queen of the underworld.Jk
But I was crowned Queen when I turned eighteen. That because my parents had died when I was ten years old and had a secret that will change my life. Also my grandma and grandpa became King and Queen again when my parents died.
I see your wondering that every Queen has a King but I didn't at one point cause things weren't good at the time.
You see things turned from the better to the worst once I became Queen. There was a war coming up about.....will I can't say yet but you'll find out soon enough but for now let's get to know each other.
My name is Rebecca Smith Queen of England. Eighteen years old and have two siblings who are twins boys. I don't have Prince Charming or King charming as people say it. And I have the biggest secret that no one knows except for my brothers and the people who work at the Castle that will help me in war. Find out Rebecca's secret on Don't Say It.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hello my lovelies I have another book that you should read "if" you want to cause it your choice to read it or not.Don't worried I will try to check my spelling and errors on this book. So you won't be confused about what I trying to say. Also I will go over the errors on What is Love to you when I'm not lazy which is all the time but I do it for you guys. If you have any ideas for any of my stories DM me and will try to make it happen cause I easily get writers block.
Have a good day or night.
