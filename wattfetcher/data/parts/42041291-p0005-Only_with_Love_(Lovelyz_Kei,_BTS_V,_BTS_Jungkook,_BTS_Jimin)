"Yeah but you just grabbed me and I thought you were going to kidnap me!"I pouted.
"Haha....Well..I was suppose to kidnap you on a date..."He said.
"Date?"I confusely said.
"Yeah a date...Well I would want to know you better since your V's precious sister."he said.
"I wouldn't say precious....."I silently said.
"So...do you want to have a small get to know each other?"He said as he placed his hand forward, signaling me to accept it.
I gladly took his hand and nodded.
"But...I have to tell my members that I'm alright."
"Nah! You can just text them later."he whined.
I chuckled then said,
"Where do want to go then?"I asked.
"That should be my question."He pouted.
I smiled and thought of a place.
"Hm....How about the nearest café?"
"Then lets go!"Jimin said as he pulled me.
*At the Café......
While Jimin was telling the orders I noticed a lot of girls looking at him.
Well...thats usually expected from a idol..
Jimin was finally back.
"So.....Since I want to get to know you better, ....did you ever have a boyfriend?"He suddenly asked.
"Uh..... I..Actually haven't experienced having a boyfriend."I said in a shy tone.
"Really?!"He said amazed.
"Yeah..., then how about you?"I asked.
He didn't answer my question instead he was counting his fingers.
"Bwo! You have experienced having a lot of girlfriends?!"I said.
"Ne....."he proudly said.
"Ah....I see."I said and looked away.
"I heard from V..that your not real siblings."Jimin said.
"Yeah, My foster father adopted me then got married to V's mother."
"Where's your father now?"Jimin asked.
"Uh....."I couldn't seem to answer his question because my father's .....dead.
"You don't have to answer the question." he said.
"But....Do you want me to tell you a secret?"He whispered.
"Uh...sure."I said.
I came closer then.....he said. "I really like you~."He said.
I quickly backed up and placed a shocked face.
"Yah, stop lying."I laughed .
He laughed along but didn't say anything afterwards.
"Oh! Our Coffee's here."I said.
We both drank our coffee's and spended a wonderful time talking about our life.
It was already 6:40pm so I told Jimin I had to go home already.
"I need to go home now Jimin, see you tomorrow."I said as I slowly stood up.
"Do you want me to bring you at your home?"he said.
