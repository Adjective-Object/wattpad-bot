At last ! here it is .. THE FIRST CHAPTER XD
NOT EDITED *
Leena's POV :
At last, the day has come.
"Allah yehmikii " Mom said while crying ..
Dad hugged me and gave me some advices, mostly about boys: not to talk to them, not to be close to them etc ...  you know protective dads *sigh*
We hugged, kissed and cried for minutes, I'm their one and only daughter so it's not easy for them, "salaam" I let one last tear, then got in the plane.
I can't believe it !!! I'M GOING TO AMERICA ! ALONE!!! My dream came true, but I will miss Jordan for sure .... Naaah I won't Haha .
"Welcome to plane number 189, we hope you enjoy your time because it's going to be a long trip" The pilot's voice was like some piano in my ears, nobody could imagine how happy and excited I was.
I sighed in relief  as I kept watching everything getting smaller and smaller until all I could see was the white soft clouds that looked like cotton candy, I wished I could taste some !
"Hey" The girl beside me grabbed my attention, Oh god ! She's American !! ugghh I'm not that good in English I hope I don't embarrass myself !
"Hey" I shook her hand
"Going for tourism?" she smiled widely.
"Nah, studying" I answered
-"Cool"
-"What about you ? Why were you in Jordan" I asked
-"Tourism"
We talked for 6 hours, she sounded cute.
"When are we going to reach America ?" I raised an eyebrow, I started to get bored and lost some of my excitement.
"In 10 hours or so "
"Ugghhh" I murmured.
"Why don't you take off that head scarf" She tried to pull it.
"Excuse me ???"
"come on ! I bet you look better without it , and your parents aren't here" she smirked.
"Yeah they are not , but God is watching" I smiled .
"okay whatever" she rolled her eyes .
It's okay she doesn't know what does hijab mean .
I felt my eyelids getting heavy so I closed them and took a nap ..
"Leena wake up wake up" Isabella woke me up .
"Are we there yet?"
"Yeah ! get up" she pulled me out of my seat while I was still half asleep
"Come on we need to take our bags" she dragged me out and all I could do was nodding.
........
We exchanged numbers and said goodbye to each other before she left . I took my bags then started walking in the airport like a lost puppy...
mind: do you know where to go ?
me: naah
mind: do you know who is going to pick you up ?
me: naah
mind: stupid
me: shut up
