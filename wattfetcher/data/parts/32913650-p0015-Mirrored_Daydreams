My eyes opened to a bright sun through Gavin's window. I saw his clock as it read 11:24AM. Gavin was still asleep and so was Adam. I kissed Gavin's cheek and slipped out of his dorm and went back to mine. The girls were all awake, and they all ran to me. "Where were you?!" "What happened?" "Were you crying?" I shushed them and told them everything. From what happened with Isaiah to falling asleep with Gavin at his dorm. "Isaiah? That cute, techy guy?" Shelby asked. "Yeah, him..." I said. "You dated him? Like not that I'm surprised because you're hot too but when? Was he like a major nerd?" Shelby asked. I laughed. "Yeah, he was a nerd, but he was still cute... and sweet. We always talked about moving to California and traveling the world with each other, and just our future in general." I explained.
- FLASHBACK -
Isaiah and I just sat there, staring at his ceiling. The soft music playing had made me sleepy so I grabbed Isaiah and cuddled him, and we kissed sleepily while laying there. "I wanna live in California... with you." I murmured to Isaiah. "One day, we will," Isaiah murmured back. "Then we'll travel the world together." He added. "I've always wanted to travel the world," I said while smiling. "With someone I'm madly in love with," I giggled, half asleep. "I love you." Isaiah said. "I love you too." I said, kissing him once more before falling asleep.

"When?" Hannah asked. "Like when did you date him?" She added. "We started dating freshmen year and we broke up a little while after senior year ended in high school." I replied. "Wow, so y'all dated for awhile." Claudia said. I nodded. "So like a year ago you two broke up?" Shelby asked. I nodded my head. "I caught him cheating with that bitch I once called my best friend." "HE CHEATED ON YOU WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND?!" Shelby yelled. "Ex best friend." I said. "Wooow, that is so fucked up." Hannah said. "Why would she ever do that?!" Claudia asked. "I don't know," I said. "But I'm glad I have you guys now, you guys are the best." I said. They all 'aww'ed and hugged me. "It's a really good thing you didn't take him back." Shelby said. "Yeah," I replied. "I really miss him though." "Don't worry, you'll find someone better than that douche!" Hannah said. "Yeah, like Gavin," Claudia winked. "Ooh yeah, you did sleep at his dorm. Any cuddling?" Shelby asked/stated. I felt my face get warm. "Yeah, actually." I said, remembering me falling asleep in his arms. "Dannnng." Shelby said then Hannah laughed and Claudia wiggled her eyebrows. "I think he really likes you," Hannah said. "Yeah!!" Claudia agreed. "Even Adam thinks so..." Hannah added. "No, I'm sure Adam knows so!" Shelby said. "True." Claudia said. I smiled, thinking about Gavin. My phone vibrated and I got a text from Gavin:
"Did you go back to your dorm already?"
"Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you :("
"No it's okay :)"
"Okay yayy :)"
"Ooh, someone's already texting her lover boy," Shelby said. I laughed. "Shut up, Shelbs!" "We go back to school tomorrow!" Hannah screeched. My jaw dropped. "Shit! I haven't even gotten that many school clothes," I said. "Me neither!" Claudia and Hannah both said. "You know what that means!" Shelby said. "Shopping!" She yelled. "We should invite the boys," Hannah said. "Yeah, that'd be fun," I replied. "I'm already calling Sam," Shelby said, turning away to talk to San. We all pulled out our phones and I dialed Gavin's number. "Hello?" He answered. "Hey, it's Clarissa," "Yeah, I know." He said, and I could almost hear his smile. "I was wondering if you wanted to go to school shopping with the guys and girls... Oh, and me?" I asked. "Of course, yeah! Let me go get ready." He said. "Okay, well I'll see ya later, byeee." "Bye!" I hung up and we all started getting ready.
We all met up by Shelby and I's and Claudia drove us to the mall and we shopped for HOURS. Even the guys bought a whole bunch of stuff.
