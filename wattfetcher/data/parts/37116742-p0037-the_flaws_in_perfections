All the little stars we stare at will disappear
Every cigarette enjoyed will smoke away
I don't want to leave things unsaid
But I handed her the gun
I thought she could ruin me
Now I know that I'm bulletproof
Everything will burn out one day
Including me
It's coming over like a suicide
I won't close my eyes
