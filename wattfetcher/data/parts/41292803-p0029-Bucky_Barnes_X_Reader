Ps. Peeps. I know it seems like just filler chapters (chapters that just kinda exist with no apparent reason and add nothing to the plot) They however are not. Almost every chapter has a least one element that adds to the plot. I could not and would not remove any chapter because you would be lost. Just thought I should let you know. BTW. Chapter 21 made me sooo happy. My finest yet. Sorry. I just really liked that chapter. Love ya and thanks for reading.
