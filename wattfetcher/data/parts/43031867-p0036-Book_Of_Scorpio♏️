In order for you to be at ease, you need to stop worrying about the unknown and just enjoy what you already know. Relax with your close and trusted friends while drinking your choice of drink and talking about whatever. Playing video or computer games with your gaming buddies and thrilling your competitive spirit, by playing laser tag or paintball, are all therapeutic.
