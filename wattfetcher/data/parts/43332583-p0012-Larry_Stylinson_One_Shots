Louis stood up and moved around the other side of the bad in front of Harry. Harry looked up from his hands, as his head was resting in them, and saw Louis had a big smile on. "Wha-" Harry got cut of as Louis grabbed him by the waist lifting him up to stand and placed his hands on his cheeks.
"I'm inlove with you too, Harry. I love you too." Louis said, smiling. Harry lips curved up into the biggest smile he could manage. "R-Really?" He asked. Louis nodded. "I love you." Harry said. "I love you." Louis said, not adding the 'too' pat to the end as he thought it made it less special.
Tell me am I crazy? Or is this more than a crush?
Both boys stared at the other in the eyes for what seemed like hours. Harry started to lean down but stopped in fear and nervousness. "Just kiss me." Louis said. That was all he needed to say for Harry to make the final move to close the space between them. Louis smiled.
Yeah, he was inlove.
