"I know, I'm just waiting for my friend. She has the money." Lacey lies, glancing around for her missing friend.
Avery peeks her head out of the aisle. Her eyes expand once she sees Lacey still standing at the exit. "What are you doing?" She mouths.
"Waiting for you!" Lacey mouths back, urging her friend to hurry.
"Miss," the clerk says, his voice growing annoyed. "You need to pay for those-..."
"Run, Lacey!"
The two girls sprint out of the store and run down a crowded street. They hear the store clerk shout "Somebody stop those girls!"
"Run faster!" Avery demands. The girls run faster and accidentally bump into a group of boys.
"Somebody get those girls!" The clerk's voice faints.
Avery looks behind her and screams when a pair of tan arms surround her. "Get off me, fucker!" She struggles to get out of the tough grip and when she sees two boys continue to run after Lacey, she screams again. "Lacey! Behind you!"
Before Lacey can turn the corner, she is tackled to the ground. The bottles of Fireball roll into the street, and she scrambles to retrieve them, only to have her arms pinned down on the concrete.
"Get the fuck off me, you dickhead!" She belts, struggling against the boy's tight grip. When Lacey looks up, she freezes.
Michael is straddling her stomach and looking at her dead in the eye. She opens her mouth to speak, but no words come out.
"It's you," Michael breathes, a smile spreading across his face. He strokes her cheek softly. "It really is you."
