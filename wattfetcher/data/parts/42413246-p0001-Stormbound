Magic was something great; powerful. Something that wasn't in everyone and only embedded to one at birth. Out of a million, roughly only a hundred would have magic and furthermore then called as superhumans. Of course, humans and superhumans, they all have the same mindset; same feelings. The ones with powers would learn their powers, control it and like any other, most of them would show how great having magic was.
Then it made the huge population of the powerless angered but they could do nothing compared to the superhumans. They could fly, run as fast as light, control fire and normal humans? Their only source of weapon was from the military, police or might as well everyday items we use.
It stayed like that for a while before a case that came by and spread like wildfire. A group of four teenage superhumans, dangerously misusing their magic, resulting in mass of deaths. It became a catastrophe and after a single day, a new law was divulged.
A law that maintained until the new age.
Behead superhumans.
A war commenced soonly after the law was made. The superhumans had their own powers and it wiped out most of the humans. But they were overpowered. Humans came in hoard of people with their own simple weapons like a baseball bat, axe, some even came with an ordinary kitchen knife.
Most of the superhumans talked big and fight the hoard coming at them and some flee. By the time the war ended, the superhumans was never to be seen.
Now at the new age, superhumans came back. Back to where they belong....but magic was no longer used. The magic the superhumans had was forgotten, and they had to live not knowing how to use neither control their own abilities. It was safer that way.
