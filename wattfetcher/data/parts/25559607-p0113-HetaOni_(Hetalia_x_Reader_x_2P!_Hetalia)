"Then we should be off." Lutz said.
My eyes widened. "W-Wait! No, hold on... Where are you guys--"

At that, the 2Ps started gathering their weapons and walked out of the door one by one.
"Hey, Oliver. Keep a close eye on the girl. Don't let her walk out this door." Matt called out before he exited the room. He was the last one to leave.
As the door closed, I suddenly snapped myself back to reality.

My eyes started to well up. "Why? Why does it have to be like this? You guys have suffered, but they have suffered, too! Both sides are suffering! Both sides are hurt. Everyone...is..."
Oliver suddenly pulled me into a hug. "Shh... Poppet, don't...cry..."
"Please...let me out of here." I pleaded.
He tightened his hug upon hearing this. "...I'm sorry, I can't."
I pulled away from him and stared into his blue orbs that swirled pink.
"Please...Ollie."
