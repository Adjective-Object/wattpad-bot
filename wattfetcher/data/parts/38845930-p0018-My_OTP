Jordan's POV
After the hour of crying, Erin and I just cuddled and talked mostly.
"I can not tell you enough how much I love you." She said.
"Same for me. And did you happen to know I love you?" I asked.
"Yes, Jordan." She said as she rolled her eyes and grabbed my hand.
"You're so beautiful." I said.
"Baby." She said before kissing me.
"I love you." I said.
"I love you." She said back before I shed a tear and kissed her.
"Umm... " She said before laughing awkwardly and sniffling. "I thought we couldn't cry anymore." She said.
"Screw that! who cares if we cry?" I said.
"Good, because I'm gonna cry aga -- " She said before she started to cry and cover her eyes.
"No, Erin. Baby, why?" I asked.
"Ugh, shut up, Erin! Mmm! I'm sorry!" She said as her face got slightly more red.
"Don't say sorry, why are you crying again?" I asked.
"I can't do this. I don't want everyone to know but they already do." She said quietly yet enough that I just barely heard her.
"Oh, no. Please don't cry. Please don't make me cry again." I said.
"I can't -- what do -- how am I supposed to -- I don't know what to do, Jordan."
Erin's POV
I can't stop crying. What is wrong with me that I can't stop crying? I keep making Jordan upset 'cause I cry, then we both cry, and... it all sucks!
"Baby." He said.
"I can't take this. Do you see what happened? Why would someone want to do that?" She asked.
"I don't understand why someone wouldn't just say to themselves that they shouldn't do it." I said.
"Oh, Jordan!" She said before kissing me and leaning her face against mine.
"Oh my god, mmm." I said.
