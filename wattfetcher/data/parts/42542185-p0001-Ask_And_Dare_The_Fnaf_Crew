Wolfy: Hi, guys! So mylittlemuffin ask to make a book together and we chose to do an Ask The Fnaf Crew book and she has a dare for Foxy.
mylittlemuffin: I dare Foxy to kiss Mangle and tell Old Chica she's ugly.
Foxy: What?! Come on! I don't want to!
Wolfy: Just do it, you big baby.
Foxy:Fine, Mangle will you go out with me?
Mangle: Oh my god! YES!! *death hugs Foxy*
Foxy: Can't...breathe...
Mangle: Whoops...sorry.
Foxy: Chica!
Old Chica: Yes?
Foxy: You're ugly.
Old Chica: Really? I was trying to look like you today. *walks away*
Foxy: ......
Wolfy: Well, at least you did the dare.
mylittlemuffin: Thanks for reading. Comment dares or questions and we will force the victims to do/answer them.
