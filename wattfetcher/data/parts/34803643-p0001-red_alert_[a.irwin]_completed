red alert is an ashton irwin alternate universe work of fiction. ashton irwin is not himself and does not have his personality in this book. red alert's ashton is a completely original character. the rest of the characters in the book are either original, such as rose, or are real, such as ashton. all of the characters that are real, again, such as ashton, have only two things that are alike in their real and red alert selves: their looks (face, hair, body, ectera) and names. in short, everything and everyone in red alert is a work of fiction (except for looks and names based off of a real person.)
updating has stopped, due to the completion on this book on june 27th, 2015.
enjoy reading, not copying.
warning: strong coarse language, violence and death. read at your own risk and be aware of your comfort zone.
