Hey upper east siders. Gossip Girl here, and I have the biggest news ever. One of my many sources--melanie91-- sends us this. Spotted at grand central, bags in hands, Serena Van Der Woodsen. Was it only a year ago our it girl mysteriously disappeared for boarding school? And just as suddenly she's back. Don't believe me? See for yourselves. Lucky for us melanie91 sent us proof. Thanks for the photo Mel. Spotted--Lonely Boy, can't believe the love of his life has returned. If only she knew who he was. But everyone knows Serena and everyone is talking. Wonder what Madilynn Waldorf thinks. Sure her, Serena, and her sister, Blair are bffs but we always thought Madi's boyfriend, Dustin had a thing for Serena. Better lock it down with Dustin, M. Clocks ticking and what a shame Dustin is out of town. Word is S bailed on B's party in under 90 seconds and didn't even have one Limoncello. Has our bad girl really gone good? Or is it all just part of the act? Why'd she leave? Why'd she return? Send me all the deeds. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. The only one..X.O.X.O. Gossip Girl
***Spotted on the steps of the met. An S and B power struggle. Did S think she could waltz home and things would be just like they were? Did B think S would go down without a fight? Or can these two hotties work it out? There's nothing Gossip Girl likes more than a good cat fight and this could be a classic.
***Madilynn's .p.o.v.
"Miss Madilynn! Miss Amelia is here!" My maid, Dorota yells. "Okay! I'm coming!" I shout back as I jump off my bed. Amelia and I were supposed to study together today. Amelia has been my best friend since ninth grade. Sure she wasn't rich and well known but there was something that I loved about her. Once she was my best friend she started speaking her mind and now she is one of the most well known people at our school. I rush downstairs to see Amelia awkwardly standing by the elevator. "Hey! Fabray! Get up here!" I shout with a smile. She chuckles, shaking her head as she walks upstairs. We walk into my room and close the door after us. She plops on my bed with a sigh. "Guess what just happened." Amelia says as she sits up, facing me. "What? Did Chuck try to flirt with you again? Cause I told you I can and I will beat his ass if he does." I remind Amelia. "No that's not it but thanks." She says with a smile. "Then what happened?" I ask confused as I sit beside her. "Blair invited me to The Kiss On The Lips party." She says looking confused at her own words. "Really?" I ask trying to sound suprised. "You told her to didn't you?" She asks. Blair is my twin so I can get whatever I want when I want. "Oh come on, Amelia! All we ever do is do homework at my house and eat pie at your house! We never go to party's with Nate and Chuck and everyone else!" I complain in a whiney voice. Nate and Chuck were our other best friends. We really didn't like the rich, snobs at school. "Cause we need to do homework to get into good schools and we love pie." She says with a smile. "Please just go to this one party. If you don't like it we don't ever have to go to a party ever again! Please!" I beg using my famous puppy dog eyes. "Ugh fine!" She groans and falls back onto my bed as I smile.
***Spotted at the Palace hotel S and B having a heart to heart. Hmm why so thirsty S? You may have won over B, for now, but we still think you're hiding something. And just when B and S had built a bridge, it all had to come crashing down,but dry your eyes. The Kiss On The Lips party is just around the corner. And you know who loves parties? Gossip Girl.
