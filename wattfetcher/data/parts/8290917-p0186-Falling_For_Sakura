Slowly, he opened the card.
I will always be your Snow.
I love you.
Sakura
A sound escaped his lips and Darcy felt dizzy. His heart began to beat fast.
"Snow," he whispered, closing his eyes, trying to calm his beating heart. Then when he fully comprehended the meaning of those few words, he flashed his eyes open, jolted up, and screamed, "Sakura!"
His heart was pounding so hard and so irregularly within his chest that the machine started beeping loudly in the room, indicating abnormal heart rate. Darcy was lost in his rage and despair as tears flowed down his cheeks from his eyes and the world spun around him. "Sakura, don't leave me!" he cried, his eyes dark, his voice shaking. "Don't. I love you. You can't leave me. Please, Sakura."
He scrambled off the bed, mindlessly tearing away IV lines from his arms. "I have to find you. Where are you, Sakura? Please, come back."
The door burst open and two nurses rushed into the room. They took one look at him and immediately took him by the arms and tried to make him return to bed.
Darcy wouldn't listen to them, however, and shook his head as he fought them off, thrusting a nurse against the wall as he headed for the door. It was then that the brothers, who had just arrived, rushed into the room. Sebastian caught Darcy in his arms and managed to calm him down.
"She's gone," Darcy whispered, tears in his eyes. "She left."
Sebastian nodded.
"We can't just leave it and do nothing," Darcy said. "We have to find her." He looked up at his brothers, begging them with his eyes to agree with him, to help him find the woman he loved. Before him stood Nicolas, Tristan, Logan, Hayden, and Conrad, and one by one, they nodded, a determined look in their eyes.
"We'll look for her, Darcy," Sebastian said, his hand tight on Darcy's shoulder. "We'll find her."
"Together," Darcy said. "We'll find her together."
Sebastian nodded and said, "Yes, together."
The brothers nodded again, and Darcy smiled, tears in his eyes.
