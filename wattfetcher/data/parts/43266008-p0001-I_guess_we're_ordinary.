Moving day: Alex's POV:I ran and hugged Connor really tight when I got into his car."How was your flight?" He asked. "I am so tired! I was stuck in front of a screaming baby the whole 5 hours..." I groaned as I rubbed my eyes."Awwww hun..."He drove all the way to the O2L house. "Before we go in." "Yeah?""So you're going to be the only girl and I want you to be carful.""Yeah, yeah!""You're staying with us till we get our own place okay?""Yeah!!!" I said. I grabbed my bags and we went inside.I walked into seeing Ricky singing Beyonc√©. I giggled and followed Connor to the guest bedroom. "This is your room! I'll let you unpack and you can introduce yourself. Ummm just to let you know, they love your videos and they don't know you're my sister. I kept it a secret" I laughed and I unpacked.Then I thought."Connor!?" I yelled."Yeah?" He said walking in."Let's pretend I flew here to do a collab with you.""Yes!"I unpacked my things and went downstairs."Shut up... You're Alex Bourne. I love your videos!" JC said."Thanks!

JC said.I smiled and looked down.Ricky's POV: I can't believe I am In front of my crush. She had been my YouTube crush for years now. Her videos had always made me laugh. I never gotten to meet her cause she  always loved picking a fan to go with her to events and I never had the guts to talk to her. That has changed.Alex's POV:I heard Connor coming downstairs. Going along with the plan. He came down, wrapped his arms around me and kissed me on the cheek. Jc and Ricky's jaws dropped and I smiled."Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you..." I said."You guys are dating?" Ricky asked."No, he's my brother!!!" I said.Kian came downstairs and came up to me. "Oh hey!" He said."Hey!" I said back. They were in total shock.I laughed.
