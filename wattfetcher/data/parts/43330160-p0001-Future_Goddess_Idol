I enter the classroom when the teacher call my name.All the people's eyes in the class watching me.After a few seconds,I stop walking and stand beside the teacher."Alright,guys.This is our new friend.Lala, can introduce yourself?"the teacher ask me while giving me a marker.
I write my name on the whiteboard,'Lala Doremi'."My name is Lala,Lala Doremi.Transfer student fron Japan.Nice to meet you."I said boringly."Any question?"the teacher ask again.No voice.
"Lala,your seat is...there!"the teacher pointing at the blank seat rearmost.The seat is beside the biggest window here.I walking to the seat,again with the blank view they have on me.
I put my LV bag on the table.
