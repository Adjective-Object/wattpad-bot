???: y/n, I love you. Do you love me too?.Y/n: I don't know what to say...but..???: Y/n! Y/n! Y/n! Wake up!
Y/n's POV:
"Y/n! Please wake up!" shouted a female voice..it seemed familiar.."Y/n!!" she shouted again."What!" now i'm shouting."What is wrong with you!?" I asked."What's wrong with me? I'm fine. What's wrong with you?!!"she shouted. "Huh?" I asked in confusion."You've been sleeping for hours!! I thought that you're never going to wake up, so i got worried and tried to wake you up again and again!!" she cried."Okay, hush now and let's go home." I say keeping her calm. I don't want my bestfriend to be depressed and worried about me.
We're here at the AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE and i'm planning to enter to be a night guard working night shift  at a restaurant named FREDDY FAZBEARS PIZZERIA also i find it's name a bit creepy but a work is a work so i have no choice but to work there starting tomorrow. So i better get ready.
Third person's POV:"I heard that we're going to have a new company here." vincent stated."Yes we do, so better be courteous and polite to her." Mr. Fazbear warned."So she's a girl, well this better be fun". Vincent bursted.
Y/n's POV:
"So tomorrow night's going to be the start of my first shift as a night guard, I wonder how it's like  when you are working for the night shift. Will it be fun, tiring, exciting, boring or creepy? Oh well, let's just find out." I wonder.
A/N:So how's the prologue? Like it or not. It's ok. But i'll try my best not to fail you my lovers. :* (sorry if it's short) :(
