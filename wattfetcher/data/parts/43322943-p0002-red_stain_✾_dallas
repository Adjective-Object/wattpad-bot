"night dad." i say setting lily down as i grabbed the bag and walked upstairs.
i walked into the bathroom and put in a pad. i wash my hands and i walk out.

i read it and couldn't stop blushing. i plugged in my phone as i continued to watch neighbors.
i heard a knock at my door and looked to see it was my dad.
"night sweetie." he says bending down to kiss my head as he shut the lights off so it caused the television to shine brighter.
"thanks dad." i say with a small smile as the door slowly closed. i laughed at some parts and put the pop on my nightstand.
i close my eyes and started thinking about cameron.
he's very hot. he could fuck me anytime, anyday, anywhere.
