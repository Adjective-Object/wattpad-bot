"Yeah you better get going." Jaxin said.
"Oh alright then I'll see you later on the bus." I called after him.
"You need to steer clear of him."
I frowned, "Alan? Why?"
"He likes you obviously."
I shook my head, "No he doesn't."
"Yeah he does. I don't want to lose you again, so stay away."
"Jax you're not going to lose me." I said giving him a reassuring kiss, "Don't worry so much. Alan's just a friend."
"Okay, I trust you on this."
"Good." I said smiling, "Come on let's go do something, like have a drink and lay under the stars."
"Sure," He said grabbed a bottle of beer.
I grabbed one for myself and walked with Jaxin to the emptier part of the field we were all in.
"I'm so glad you took me back." He said smiling.
"Yeah me too." I said and kissed him again. I didn't like this. His lips on mine wasn't a feeling I've missed. I couldn't break it off right now when I just got with him again. I'm such an idiot. But it was better than trying to go after someone who didn't want me. And it got lonely sometimes on tour and since things obviously weren't going anywhere between Alan and I then I guess this is better than nothing. Besides he's good in bed and that's all that really matters.
"Aust, lets go do something now." He said pulling away.
I nodded, "Okay, lets."
The two of us got up and hurried back to the buses and back to my bunk as quickly as possible.  Soon enough clothes were being thrown around and it was quick and hot before we finished and he fell asleep with me.
The next morning though, I woke up alone. I grabbed a pair of boxers before slipping out from my bunk, "Jax?"
"He's gone." Aaron said looking up from his phone.
"Is he coming back?"
He shook his head, "Doubt it. What the hell were you doing with him anyways?"
"We, uh, got back together last night."
"Well it looks more like it was just a one night stand."
"No it wasn't. He came back last night and begged me to get back together with him. " I said shaking my head, "I'm gonna call him."
"Yeah well you go do that." He said looking back down at his phone.
I left him and went back to my bunk looking for my phone. When I found it I quickly dialed his number and waited for him to answer.
"Hello?"
"Hey babe. Why did you leave this morning?" I asked.
"Because I had shit to do. Why are you calling me babe?"
"Because you came to me last night begging to get back together... Why wouldn't I call you babe?"
"Oh I just wanted to fuck." He said laughing, "I don't want to get back together with you."
"So you just used me again."
"Well I wouldn't say used."
"You used me again! Don't try to say its something else! You used me as your toy again and I keep fucking falling for it every time. This is it Jaxin, I'm fucking done. Stop calling, texting, finding me. Just leave me the hell alone!"  I shouted before hanging up and throwing my phone back in my bunk. I sighed, I can't believe I fucking fell for his shit again. At least I got sex out of it though.
