okay this song just ticked me off.im not even..(the song is the stereotypes song)im laughing out of irritation by now and im pretty sure i sound crazy...
all i can say is..you know what?never mind,you dont even want to know..and if you really want to know check the song out...but be warned.
as i continued editing my story the wrost song EVER came on making me growl out a metal scream...but i did it wrong and ended up hurting my throat making me get cut off and make a vomit noise as i clenched my throat.
,"that...that was my fault.."
