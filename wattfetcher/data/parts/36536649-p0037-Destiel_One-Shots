There was once a boy. He hated everything about himself, save for his ability to pick best friends.
The boy's name was Dean Winchester. And his best friend was Castiel Novak.
Once, Dean sat on the edge of a cliff. Castiel was just a few feet back, attempting to coax him off the edge.
"How?" Dean asks him. "How am I supposed to go on when I have nothing, when I am nothing?"
"Nothing?" Castiel repeats. "Nothing? How can you say that? How can you say you're nothing when you're my everything?"
"Everything?" Dean says in a hushed whisper.
"Everything. You are my night and day. My sun and stars. You're the moon, always glowing, igniting the dark sky with light. You're the paint on a canvas, the words in a story. The greatest thing that ever walked the Earth."
Now Castiel was on the edge too.
"If one of us goes, we both do. It's been that way since we were little," Cas says.
"I don't want to go," Dean reassures him. "Not anymore. Not after knowing I have you."
"You'll always have me, Dean. There was never a time you didn't own my heart. I'll go anywhere you go. I'll follow you, even in death. I will always need you."
"I love you, Cas," Dean says.
"I love you, Dean," Cas says against Dean's lips.
