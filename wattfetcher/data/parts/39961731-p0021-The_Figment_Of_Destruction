"Um... guys... did you hear that?" I asked.
"Hear what?" Max questioned.
"A strange laugh... Did you hear it?" I asked again.
"No... Charlie, I think you're going on a different path of insane." Alex said. "Well, anyway, I gotta go find somebody. Bye."
"Ok... Bye." I waved as Alex walked away. Then, I turned to Max. "So, it's just us, right?"
"Not for long. I'm gotta go bash a bastard's head against the lockers for getting me detention yesterday." Max explained. "But I hope you make it through the weekend. Bye."
"Bye." I responded. Once Max ran off, Lily and the Barbies came running to me in their- I don't know... 6? -inch heels.
"Hey, Charlie." Lily greeted.
"Hey, Lily." I replied.
"Ew! Why are we here with the rat, Lily?!" Lindsay screamed. I huffed and rolled my eyes.
"No one asked for your opinion about me, Barbie." I scoffed.
"Ok, ok. Anyway, guess what?" Lily said.
"Your friends are moving to New York?! That's so great!" I shouted.
"You wish." Emma whispered.
"Haha, but no. Shawn asked me out!" Lily squealed.
"Well, of course he would ask you out. You two are a couple now." I remarked. Lily raised an eyebrow and I realized what I had just said was somehow "wrong." "Oh, I mean, congrats." She grinned and started clapping. "And just to be clear, he means a real, actually date?"
"Of course. Oops! I forgot. You don't know what a date is because you've never been on one." Emma stated. Lindsay and her started laughing and lazily high-fived. Even though that was true, I was not gonna let her get the best of me.
"Yeah. You're right. I haven't been on a date, but I would know how to keep a guy for more than a hour." I pointed out. Both of their jaws dropped. I laughed, then turned back to Lily. "Anyway, what do you want from me?"
"It's about my wardrobe." Lily responded. "What should I wear? What should I do? I'm so confused!"
"Woah. Calm down." I stopped her rambling. "It's no big deal. And why would you ask me about this? You know I'm not interested in those stuff."
"Ok, ok. I need to calm down." Lily told herself. She slowly took in some deep breaths before speaking again. "It's just... You set both of us up together and I was thinking... maybe you knew more about this than you think you do."
"Well, I do watch a lot of TV..." I said. "Ok. You don't wanna be too flashy, yet not too... homeless. You get me?"
"I totally get you." Lily agreed. "I too watch Bridezillas." I laughed and shook my head.
"You're actually taking fashion advice from her?! Look at what she's wearing! She looks so poor! Oh, yeah! She is poor." Carrie blurted out and laughed. The other two joined her.
"Shut up, Carrie!" Lily shouted. "Stop being rude to Charlie. At least she has a bigger brain than your walnut one."
I couldn't help but laugh. Externally, I was laughing like the casual donkey, but internally, I literally felt my lungs shutting down. I'm sorry, but with Barbies, you could easily slay those bastards.
"I don't care and OMG that's so rude! How could you say that?!" Carrie replied. Lily rolled her eyes.
"I can't believe you're actually friends with her." Lindsay remarked.
