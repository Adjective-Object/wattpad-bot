So
This story is going to be about mental disorders. They'll help inform you on what they are, see if you think you have a mental disorder, and because I feel like putting this out there.
I'm not a doctor, but I use trustable sites for information on disorders that I don't have information on.
Please, seek help from a doctor if you believe you need it.
(Trust me, it helps.)
Also, there could be trigger warnings in this book. I don't know.
