I gave her a faint smile. Maybe Sakura isn't that bad after all. "Fine, just basic information." I told her. "My name is Taylor Rush, twenty years old. I went to Princeton at fourteen because of a scholarship-I'm not that smart compared to my mother."
Sakura nodded, listening deeply to any words that came out of my mouth. "Well then." The blonde clapped her hands together. "My name is Sakura de Amoir, nineteen-turning twenty in a month. I went to Ochanomizu University-Japanese School of course."
"But you don't look Japanese." I bluntly but honestly told her.
The blonde girl shrugged. "Remember that I said I'm a quarter Japanese?" She recalled. "My father is half Japanese and my mother is full white with a Filipino ancestor." I nodded, finally understanding.
"Well I'm half Filipino," I informed her. "Ang ina ko ay puno Filipino pero aking tatay ay isang kapat Cuban." Not knowing whether she understood Tagalog or not, I decided to speak my native tongue.
She nodded, making me surprised. Seeing my expression, Sakura giggled and covered her mouth with her hand. "I understand Japanese, learned Tagalog because of my mother, and I'm slowly learning English." She explained.
"Wow, you're amazing." I sighed as the car went to a complete stop.
