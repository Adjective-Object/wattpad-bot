*Derrick/Dad's POV*
"Dad, stop pacing so much!" Alexander groaned as he was texting on his phone. "You're making my head hurt."
"I can't she isn't late like this! The only times she is, is if she's been kidnapped! What if she is? What if she's-?"
We heard the door open and Jaycie talking with Paul coming downstairs finally.
"Where have you been?!?" I asked as I rushed over and hugged her.
"I was waiting on Talon! It's Talon's fault I'm late!"
"Is not!" Talon retaliated.
"Is to! You had to go get the part!" She exclaimed.
"Shut up both of you! I swear all you two do is make fun of each other or argue." Paul grumbled.
"What do you expect? It's Talon." Link said as she was going upstairs.
"Hey! What's that suppose to mean?!" Talon asked as he tried catching up to the others.
"It means exactly what she said Talon. It's you. We don't exactly have anything on Jaycie, ok I do, but your the one that starts everything." Thalia said like it was nothing as she and the others went into Jaycie's room.
"Ugh finally. Lets get this over with now." Paul said heading to the kitchen while he shook his head.
Jaycie nodded. We all headed to the kitchen as we see a smug Alexander as he chuckles. He glanced up for a sec. Looked back down then he took the phone and put it away after he finished texting.
"I told you so." Alexander said slowly and I gave him the look to shut up, but all he did was slouch in his seat and put his hands behind his head. Still with the smug face. I wanted to smack the back of his head. "Don't even think about it Dad."
I smirked as his eyes were shut. I had walked over without him hearing as I said "Fine, I won't think about it." Then I whacked the back of his head.
Jaycie was holding in her laughter unlike Paul. Alexander grumbled as he rubbed the back of his head.
"How about reprimanding him later and get to the story, daddy? I really want to know." Jaycie said.
I nodded and started the story.
~Flashback to 18 years-old~
"Derrick! Hey Dude!" I turned to see it was Blake Garrettson.
"Garrettson! Wassup Man?" I asked him as I was headed towards my locker.
"Nothing just got an idea of what's happening tomorrow." He said with a grin.
"Yeah? Because I thought I was going to go home and sleep the weekend away?" I said.
"No your not. Please tell me you weren't going to stay home." He said.
I shrugged. "My parents are so overprotective. If I don't then they'll call and text me all day."
"Unless your with me." He stated.
"Yeah so?"
"You and I have been invited to a party and your going." He said.
I knew I had no say so I just asked who it was for.
"Oh just Bethany Hopper's Best Friends birthday. It's nothing big." He said with a grin.
I stopped in my tracks.
"What?"
