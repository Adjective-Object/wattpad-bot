Luke purses his lips. Another thing about Julie? She made him feel confident. He wasn't afraid to be himself, to take risks. And right now, Luke was about to take the biggest risk ever.
He lowers his mouth to her ear and whispers, "That's because I do," before cupping her face and pressing his lips ever so softly on hers.
He can tell she's caught off guard because she doesn't kiss him back at first, but when he pulls her as close as their bodies allow, she completely melts against him.
Her mouth is soft against his and their pace is slow with a hint of curiosity. Julie's hands wander up Luke's, dragging her nails against his smooth skin. Luke's hand presses against her lower back protectively, and he tries his hardest to contain himself, but when Julie's hands find his hair and pull slightly, he loses it.
He trails his tongue along the outline of her lip and gently bites the corner, careful not to be rough with her. She gasps softly and accidentally parts her lips, allowing Luke full entry into her mouth.
He smiles proudly against her lips, knowing his actions surprised her. Their tongues explore each other's mouths and Luke is finding it so difficult to keep his composure.
His tongue strokes Julie's and she moans into the kiss, provoking a low grumble to erupt in the back of Luke's throat.
They pull away at the same time and look at each other, hair messy and lips swollen. Both of them are breathing heavily.
Julie smiles shyly. "I haven't been kissed like that in a long time," she confesses, placing a hand on Luke's chest.
He nuzzles her cheek with his nose before kissing her. "Believe me, I was debating on it for a good couple of minutes."
They both laugh and close their eyes, falling asleep to the sound of one another's heartbeat.
this was potentially the cutest thing I've ever written I ship it so hard omffff
