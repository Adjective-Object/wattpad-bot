"Yeah, I'll text you when I get there! Then, if you like, you can come over." China said.


Japan found it reasonable and nodded, "All right. I'll be waiting here."


"Well, then, those in the first group, let's go?" England asked, gesturing the others to depart.


Japan tilted his head as he saw his friend stare blankly at a certain place. "Italy? You keep looking at the waiting room.Do you want to talk to Romano?"

"Hm? Oh, sorry. It's... nothing." he said, shaking his head. Italy creased his forehead and muttered under his breath, "That...Did I just see...? No... That's impossible..."

Japan nodded. "Yes. He was in shock, so the first thing I did was continue to look around. As a result, I ran into that dreadful monster and somehow managed to get away."
