Marionette: NOPE *runs and hides in his box*
Author-chan: Toy_bonnie-Rules dared Foxy to ride on A.A's back, and my friend Dustin dared Chica to show everyone her stacks of yaoi that she drew.
Chica: HOW DID HE KNOW!?!?!

Author-chan: I never made any promises :D  now Foxy, get on A.A's back.
Toy Freddy: I'm recording this (and putting it on YouTube mueheheh)
Foxy: Meh *climbs on A.A*
A.A:* tries to take a step forward but ends up face planting into the stack of pancakes he had been eating*
Foxy: am I really that heavy? T.T
Author-chan: yes. A.A, get up. You need to give him a ride, not faceplant into the ground. Kk?
A.A: *gets up* FIIIINE
Foxy: *climbs on A.A again.*

Chica: Fiiiinne... *pulls out a stack of drawings about three feet tall*
Freddy: wtf bruh
Everyone looks through the yaoi. Bonnie hides under a table, Foxy faints, Purple Guy nosebleeds, Freddy goes to throw up, Golden Freddy indulges in the glorious butt-ness, Mangle gets scarred for life, Marionette goes back to sleep, Toy Bonnie and Toy Freddy go... erm... do stuff..., Author-chan fangirls along with everyone else. Except for Springtrap. He was too busy putting glitter all over his room.
Phone Guy: *pauses fangirling for a second* you guys know the drill. Comment, dare, request, all that jazz. Now the camera is going to die because yaoi.
