maybe I'm screwing myself over lust is what I'm after uncomfortable butterflies sleepless nights happy dreams
it's way too fast what's your middle name? i want you to want me too i know this isn't right
putting my heart on the line for nothing more than a glance giving you my body for a touch giving you all I have for a kiss
so now I'm left to wonder what ever will happen to us
there is no us
