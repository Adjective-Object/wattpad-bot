"Thank you so much," I praise them once again, this time hugging each of the three boys in the process.
After a few more minutes of continuous conversation, I tell the trio that I have to get ready for tonight. They let me excuse myself and I make my way to the bathroom. I am not sure what to expect tonight, dozens of ideas pop into my brain.
I grab a maroon-colored, oversized sweater, comfy black leggings, and combat boots. One thing I love about this time of the year is the adorable outfits. Though, winter is not considered my favorite season of the four.
I turn on the shower water to the perfect, warm temperature then strip out of my clothes from earlier. The foggy steam rises up, out of the bathtub and I step inside.
Beads of hot water run down my backside which instantly relaxes me. I pour shampoo onto my wet hand, rubbing the substance into my hair. Thoughts are pushing to the front of my mind and I let them surround me.
I cannot believe that my birthday is today. It seemed so long ago that I was living on the streets of New York, but in reality, it's been a couple of months.
In that short amount of time, so much has happened to me, good and bad. I've met five lovely guys whom welcomed me into their place they call home. Harry used to be so rude to me, I was so hurt and confused. All this time, he's been disguising his true feelings with hateful words.
Before I can ponder any longer about past issues, I break my thoughts to finish cleaning myself. After I feel fully renewed, I step out of the shower and wrap a towel around my body.
I quickly dry myself and throw on my clothes. Then I apply natural makeup to my face. To erase my imperfections, I dab on some concealer and foundation. Next, I draw a thin line of eyeliner under both of my eyes and a few coats of mascara to my lashes. I remember Eleanor giving me some of her makeup she barely uses.
By the time I'm all done getting ready, it's almost six forty-five. I check my phone I bought a few weeks ago, well.. Harry bought the device. We fought for ten minutes straight because he insisted that he should buy it. Of course, he won.
When I turn on my phone, I have one unopened message from Harry.
I called you a cab, it'll be there around 6:50. It's payed for. See you soon. (;
His cheesy winking face at the end of the text makes me giggle at how clich√© the gesture is. I find it truly sweet that he went through the hassle of getting me a cab then paying for the fair as well.
Before I head out the door, I shout a quick goodbye to the four boys and they all wish me luck except Zayn. I wasn't expecting him to say anything anyway. Both Harry and him have developed feelings for me, but Harry is the one who got the girl. As I stand outside to wait for my ride, I begin to feel bad for Zayn. He's probably suffering seeing the girl he likes go off with another man.
Right on time, the taxi arrives and he drives off immediately when I sit down. I'm sure he was told by my date where to go. Thank god because I have to clue what we're doing or where we're going. This night will be nothing but surprises which excites me.
After ten minutes of continuous traffic, the silent cab driver parks next to an ice rink. Tell me we are not going ice sk-
"We have arrived at your destination," he speaks for the first time. I send him a small 'thank you' and hop out of the car.
Not knowing where Harry is, I begin to walk over to the ticket booth. On my way there, I spot my curly haired date sitting on a bench. He's wearing a black trench coat, skinny jeans, and an adorable beanie.
