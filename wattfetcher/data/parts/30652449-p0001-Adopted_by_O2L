Have you ever felt like you were falling in into a black hole that's how Lauren Williams felt
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
"I KNEW YOU WERE YOU WERE GOING TO COME TO ME",I yelled
"Shut the hell up Lauren",My room mate Taylor said to me.
"Why"
"Because your dangerous"
"Bye Felicia"
How rude of me I didn't introduce myself I'm Lauren , I don't know my last or middle name . Professional rapper like you may of heard of me {A/N lies lies lies} I'm lying like the lady whoever she is said. My best friend in this ugly hell is Taylor Thompson we have been friends since fourth grade and we are sisters Forever and Always. Enough about me lets get to the story.
Jc P.O.V
