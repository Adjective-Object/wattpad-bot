Leo Valdez broke my heart
His smile I'll never get His hair I'll never petHis love I'll never receiveBut I'll try not to grieveThough i might be sadI can't help but be gladIts like Cupid shot my heartNot knowing it would fall apart
He broke my heartThen set it ablazeBut his heartI couldn't even fazeBut its OK I'll be fineEven if his heart isn't mine
Maybe you are a bad boyMaybe you were one from the startI know you were a bad boyBecause you broke the good girls heart
