A menu screen appeared in front of me. ...And it was then that my fears were confirmed. I saw the list of the 1Ps and the status of their health...and it was starting to decrease.




What's going on?! Did they really...?



I couldn't make the screen show me their battle, nor their dialogues...so I decided to look for anything else. That was when I saw the inventory.

I have never seen this key in the game, I don't even know if it existed. If anything, they probably just made that recently? I'm not sure...but I think if it's there in the inventory...
