My name is Avianna Moreno and I am 15 years old. I just moved to North Carolina from my home town Tucson, Arizona. I am probably like any other out cast. You know, shy, keeps to them selves and all those other charteristics.
I have a 18 year old sister Lexi and two brothers, Sean (who is 9) and Brian (who is 8). My father getting a job offer here is the whole reason I'm in this mess. Having to meet new people and make new friends is one of my worst nightmares. I am so shy to just even look at another person without me thinking that they are judging me. My mother Belen, is one of the prettiest women I have ever seen, with her dirty blonde hair and her great personality.
I honestly can not wait to go to school tomorrow and just get everything over with...
