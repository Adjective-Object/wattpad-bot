[A/N]----HI! I hope you like it so far and I'm sorry if it sucks lol I'm new at thisðŸ˜‚I hope you like the photo of fetus 5sosðŸ˜‚ðŸ’œ-----{ Lily's p.o.v.}    I just got home and Lexi isn't here. She's probably at he boyfriends , Johns house for the day , maybe longer. So I just run up to my room. I really can believe I did that ...Jenna's gonna do something because I stood up. Fuck.Fuck. FUCK! Ugh. I never do that! I was just in a bad fucking mood!I'm just gonna do homework fuck this.    *20 minutes later *    I look at the clock to see what time it is. 8:38 P.M. I guess I'll just go to bed and wait for what punishment Jenna's gonna have in store.
"BEEP BEEP BE--" I slam my hand on my alarm clock groaning. I don't want to get up my bed is so comfy...ok Lily you can do this just get up.   *20 minutes after getting dressed*    I start to walk to school. I didn't eat breakfast because my sister wasn't home so she wasn't there to force me to. Like why do I need to eat? I'm fat enough to go without eating for awhile...right? Yeah.  I was too busy thinking to realize how close I was to school. Ok . You can do this. It can't be that bad right?   I walk thought the gates and get my books fast. People were staring and whispering about me. The normal. I ran into the bathroom to wait for the first bell. Surprisingly it worked. I ran out the bathroom and starting going to my class.      "Where do you think you're going " I hear Jenna say. I can almost hear the smirk on her face.       I spin around. Not only were Jenna and the guys there , but so were the strongest jocks in school. Fuck. She knew I couldn't fight them back          " I-i was g-going to c-c-class" I stutter. Smooth Lil. Smooth.        " Oh. Lily. Sweet little slut bag Lily. You forgot about your morning beat down!" And with Jenna saying that the guys came toward me. One of them, I think his name was Hayes ,threw a punch. But i actually dogged it! HOLY SHIT I, GETTING GOOD AT THIS!     "WHAT THE! STOP MOVING!!!" Hayes yells in frustration as I keep dogging them. But with Hayes glaring at his other friends and Luke , Calum , Michael , and Ashton , they all grab me. FUCK! I can tell this is gonna be what happens for now on. Hayes was hitting me, in the jaw , eye , stomach, you name it he hit it, while the guys held me. Jenna was yelling insults, and to my surprise they actually were pretty hurtful and that doesn't normally happen...it never really hurt me but this did.    "SLUT IM SURE YOU TRIED TO FUCK YOUR OWN DAD!"   "PROBABLY WHY YOUR PARENTS SENT YOU HERE ! YOUR SISTER WAS PROBABLY SENT TO WATCH YOU AS A PUNISHMENT! WHORE!" I actually started crying. I never self harmed because of them...I did it because my parents...me and Lexi moved because they were hitting us and dad would actually rape us...that's why they don't visit that much...not because they couldn't but because we didn't want them to. I self harmed all the time because of it, I mean my DAD took my v card and my mom watched while hitting me and calling me a slut while Lexi was on the floor in a pool of blood. I ended up in a pool of blood awhile after dad and mom left. That's when we decided to move away.   " HA YOURE CRYING! IS IT BECAUSE DADDY REJECTED YOU?!" Jenna spat. That's it. I wiggled my way out of their grip and ran out of the school. FUCK SCHOOL.
[A/N]HIIIIOOOOO
