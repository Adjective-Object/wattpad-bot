===============================
"Hurry up! We have to go shopping for the ball!" Sakura yelled excitedly.
"If I knew, I would've packed a dress at least." Aya sighed.
"Aren't you excited Haruka?" Sakura asked peering into his face, Haruka snapped out of his day dreams and looked at her.
"Not really. I'm not into those things." Haruka answered looking at the ground, as if he expected someone to pop out.
"But come on. Be excited. It be fun!" Sakura said, not knowing that at that moment, Haruka saw a woman with white hair stretching his hand out to him.
"Everything can't go your way, Mirahoshi!" Haruka shouted at Saukra.Â  Sakura was at a loss of words and Haruka was shocked. Which was a rare expression for him to show in public.
"That name..it can't be..." Sakura thought. Haruka on the other hand, realized his mistake, mumbled a quick sorry before disappearing.
"What was that about?" Aya asked Sakura, who seemed to have a feeling about what's going on.
"Nothing, let's go back to shopping." Sakura answered harshly turning around. She was very sensitive to that name. Aya just shrugged it off.
Harua on the other hand, walked through the resort rather slowly. He didn't even hear the comments his fans made. Why? Ever since, Sakura joined he's been getting flashbacks of this white-haired woman but they seem to be happening more frequently today.
Out of rage, he punched the nearest coconut tree and sat on the ledge and passed his hand through his hair. This was definitely not good.
"Um, are you okay?" Some random girl asked him.
"Yeah. I'm fine."
"But you nearly destroyed a zoo. Just now."
Haruka looking over at the quarrelling zookeeper just nodded before grabbing the girl by her shoulders.
"I'm fine. Thank you for the concern." Haruka said in smooth voice. The girl immediately went into hysterics.
Haruka was walking around the resort until he stopped at a tailor. Deciding that he might as well appear at the ball, he went in to order a suit.
--------------
Sakura just also just walking through the resort. Haruka had unknowingly hit a sensitive nerve in her. She was holding her dress in a bag and she did not see that she bumped into a familiar friend.
"Yo. What's that face for?" Ace asked teasingly. Sakura tried to answer but instead she just fainted. Her emotions too a toll on her body.
Sakura woke up the next minute in her room which the bag by her side and Ace looking at her.
"Okay now?" Ace asked grinning like an idiot. Sakura sighed before playfully punching his arm. "My life could be better."
"What happened?"
"Nothing. What time is it?"
"4:30 p.m."
"Shit! I have to get read for the ball!" Sakura exclaimed running around the place.
"I'll be outside then."
