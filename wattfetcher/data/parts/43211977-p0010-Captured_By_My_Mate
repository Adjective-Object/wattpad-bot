We exit from the Lamborghini as everyone stared at Ethan he then pulls me toward him and I know he is next to him he smiles as he kisses me for like 10 seconds.
Everyone stares at me expecially Jessica and David those sluts were the worst. as we walk in the hallJessica bumps into us and says "Well well what do we have here a lonely girl? With no friends!" While circling us "But she isn't so lonely! What do we have here? Sexy boy!" She squeezes his ass. Ethan and I let out a low growl Ethan eyes were now black replies to Jessica saying "ok you little slut why don't you go fuck him then sleep with someone else and calm your hormones would you?" I yank a angry Ethan to me attempting to calm him and I smile at a upset Jessica as we walk right through them. After everyone staring at us Ethan left me and went to his class while I went to mine. After a few hours we were in the same class that was so funny. Chemistry. Like what we have between us.
