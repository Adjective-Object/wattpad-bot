I was running. I was running with Bucky. He was telling me to hurry, but my feet refused to move. I felt like IÂ was drowning. Someone in black pointed a gun at me. My eyes slid shut as the shot fired. But instead of me slumping to the ground, I looked down as a blood flowed from a hole in his chest. I knelt down and sobbed. He was trying to tell me something but I couldn't make it out. He was struggling to breath. I saw him mouth "I love you" before his eyes slid shut.
I felt my body shake. I lay on the ground next to Bucky and looked up at the stars. I began to scream as I realized that he was gone.
