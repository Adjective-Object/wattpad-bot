"Alright a capella bitches, we're leaving!" Cynthia hollers, so I run over to the girls.
"Okay." Jessica takes a deep breath. "I am going to miss you guys so much."
"Thanks girl." Chloe wipes her eyes and copies Jessica's actions. "You guys know I didn't have a huge or supporting family, well now I do. So, thanks guys, I love you all."
"Call me, text me and stuff, guys. I'll probably annoy over texting you twenty four seven, but I guess that's okay." Stacie smiles at all of us.
"I'm going to miss you." Peeps out Lilly.
"I'm going to miss my skinny, fat hearted BFFs."
"I'm going to miss you weirdos." I speak up, when I realize I'm the only who hasn't spoke.
"Well, we are so definitely going to see each other twenty four seven, alright?" Chloe mentions and we all nod. "One last Bella exit." We all put our hands in the middle.
"One, two, three." And when I finish the count down, we all sing out the note.
"Okay, get in the cars before I ruin my make up and start crying." Stacie commands and we laugh, but we do so. I walk towards the cab that I called earlier and Jesse comes with me.
"I'm going to call you as soon as possible." He tells me, I nod. "I can't wait to move in together with you, Becca." I put his face in my hands and I kiss his lips, which he smiles through.
"Come on, you should go, Bec." My dad comes towards us and kisses my forehead. "Bye."
"Bye dad, bye Jesse, bye girls!" I call out to the girls, who smile and wave. As soon as I sit in the cab, the driver takes off. I look out the window as we drive away. I look at the rape whistle that sticks out of my bag and I smile at it, not a creepy smile, but a memory smile, the day I met Jesse. And now I have an item to remind me of that day.
