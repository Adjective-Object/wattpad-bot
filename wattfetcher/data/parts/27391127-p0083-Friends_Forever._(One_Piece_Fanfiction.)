Some of them went exploring in the forest, the non-devil fruit users went scuba diving, groups of girls went to the natural baths, some ransacked the restaurants and bars and others were at the Water Park.
Right now, the girls were  at a particular bath that was specialized for Devil Fruit users.
"Its called Morphix Water. A good bit of the attractions here use Morphix water. Morphix water is artificial and does not have the same effects as the Sea have on Devil Fruit users. This is one of the reason why the resort is so popular." One of the tour guides explained to the girls as she directed them to the Natural Baths.
"I see."
"Finally! I know what it feels like to soak in water. It's nice~"Sakura awed, with her back facing the wall.
"EH? You've never been in a bath before?"
"Well, um, no. I had my Devil Fruit ever since I was born." Sakura explained, not really feeling sorry for herself, "The most I have probably ever soaked in was.."
"Was?"
"T-The.." Sakura stuttered, unable to bring herself back from the trauma.
"Why didn't wash the dishes! They still covered with food!"
"Gomen ne. I thought I washed all the dishes properly and..."
"How dare you talk to me like that!" St.Marie exclaimed, slapping her slave. The then Asuka, promptly got herself up and couldn't answer her master's retort.
"Honestly, treating a princess like that, you insolent filth. You need to punished. Wanna join me for a Tea Party?" St.Marie asked with a very dark expression that day, whilst stretching her leather whip. Asuka only looked at the ground with fear and cold sweat started to form on her skin.
"Please anything but that!"
"Sakura, are you okay?" Aya asked her friend. Somehow hearing Aya's voice snapped out of her trance only to find her face covered in cold sweat.
"Yeah, just a flashback. That's all." Sakura reassured her friend. Usually, she wouldn't have this many flashbacks.
"Then come over here!"
"Yeah, the water is nicer in the middle."
"No thanks, I like the wall better." Sakura answered allowing herself to soak in the water. "Si rafra√Æchissant."
Meanwhile, just outside the bath....
"Yohohohoho, I hope this goes well."
"I'll finally be able to Nami-san and Robin-chan in bath." Sanji awed, peeking through a tiny hole.
"Aya-chan and Sakura -chan!" Absalom awed appearing next to them.
"Oi! What the hell are you doing here?"
"Doing the same thing as you perverts. Look someone is standing!" Absalom exclaimed as the boy noticed Nami standing up in the bath. The only thing from seeing Nami's nudity in the full was the steam and they would nearly died of a nosebleed had Nami not sent a thunder cloud behind them.
"Come on, lets get outta here."
"I agree."
"Is there something you're not telling me?" Aya asked her friend.
"No, its okay. I'm fine now."
The rest of the day was filled although the thing, most wanted to do couldn't be accomplished due to the mere fact that they were Devil Fruit users. The pool was a famous get together spot for the students as this was one of many  places that had Morphix Water.
