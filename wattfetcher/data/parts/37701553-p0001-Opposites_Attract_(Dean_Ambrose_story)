C.J.'s P.O.V.
My name is Candace Jennette but everyone calls me C.J. I'm 16 years old I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm apart of the varsity cheer squad.
Let me tell you about myself so you can get to know me a little more better. I'm very competitive I've bin a competitive person my whole life mostly in sports. I used to play tennis and volleyball when I was young but because of my competitive attitude and strength I was kicked out of both sports and kicked off of teams but I didn't mind.
I've bin bullied throughout my elementary and middle school years mostly by boys. Some girls I think only 2 girls have bullied me one time each but all of the bullying was mostly coming from those little punk hole boys.
Like I remember this one time in 4th grade this one boy sneezed and spit his gum in my hair and in 7th grade this other kid got in a lot of trouble because he got caught trying to unzip the back of my dress while I was drinking water from the water fountain in the hall luckily school security stopped him before things got worse.
Things finally got better after I finished up middle school I was now ready for high school so many things and opportunitys that were on my way and I just couldn't wait to walk through those doors.
