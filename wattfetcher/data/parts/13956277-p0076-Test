"I hate you" Elina punched my arm, "OUCH, what's all that for !" I glared at her.
"For getting us here" She answered furiously.
"What is life without taking risks anyway ?" I giggled like nothing has happened, "YOU PUNCHED A FREAKING COP !" She shouted at me.
"I didn't actually punch him" I said simply.
"THE MAN FAINTED AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DID NOT *quotes* actually punch him" I smiled at the memory of me makimg contact with the cop with my hand- well, fist.
"Oh memories" I chuckled.
"WHAT MEMORIES ! THAT WAS 5 HOURS AGO", "Why are you so furious, look at the bright side, they'll give us free food" I laughed, "YOU ARE SUCH A-
"Don't fight girls" The mustachey cop said.
You must be wondering how we ended up behind jail bars, so here's what happened 5 hours ago ......
"Are these my keys in your hand ?" Damon took 3 slow steps toward me.
"RUN ELINA" I screamed and ran to Damon's car dragging the heavy bags of clothes behind me.
"COME BACK YOU THIEF" Damon shouted at me and turned the rocket mood On.
"I'm sorry" Elina locked her door and I started the car "Bye" Elina waved at the furious red-faced Damon who was shouting and hitting the car.
I sped up and drove while laughing hysterically ....
"So, where are we going ?" Elina took a bite from the chocolate Damon keeps hidden under the seets.
"YOU ATE DAMON'S CHOCOLATE!!!" My eyes widened. There is only one thing that freaks the hell out of Damon more than stealing his car ... Eating his lovely chocolate...
"Calm down, you stole his car and now you're scolding me for stealing a bar of chocolate, concentrate on the road" Elina raised her eyebrow.
"It's not any choco- ugghhh forget it, give me one" I was about to shove one of Damon's dear chocolate bars in my mouth when ...
"STOP"
"Oh my god" Elina froze in her place and so did I, "You have license, right"
"No" My face turned yellow as I watched the Cop coming closer to my ca- well, Damon's car.
"Hello pretty ladies" A hot cop leaned on my opened window "May I help you sir ?" I said coldly.
"Ooohhh, somebody is in a bad mood" He teased.
"If you do not mind, I have some important work to do and I really have to go"
"Not so fast pretty, you broke the speed limit" I almost broke my skull, jumped out of a window, twisted my ankle, got no licenes, stole a car and about to get in jail WHAT A PERFECT DAY.
"Your license and car papers please" He commanded, I searched for the papers, giving him something is better than nothing ...
"Here they are" Elina handed me the papers with a warm smile and a deadly look after she whispered "I will kill you", "Here you go" The cop read the papers carefully, "I can tell that this car isn't yours, No way your name is Damon" BUSTED!
"It's our brother's car" Elina said nervously, "So you two are sisters ?" What a great lie Elina, great lie ! Cops are not some fools you can lie to, he can easily find the OBVIOUS differences between us *facepulm*
"I see *pause* So you two are sisters ?" He asked suspiciously and Elina nodded.
