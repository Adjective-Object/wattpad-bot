Partied yesterday on a boat!!!!!! IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!! I remember everything except when I dancing. That is a little hazy but after I saw a video my friend took I saw myself go down and so did my other friends. Woke up tired though........but the sea was so pretty. San Diego is also really pretty with its sky scrapers and all. I took this picture on the boat. It looked so cool.
