My mom is always getting onto me about how I should play sports or how I shouldn't have quit cherrleading.  And her only backup reason is you get to spend time with your friends.  I just sit there and let her talk and all that's going through my mind is, none of my friends (close friends) play sports.  Then I'm just like, if you're going to spend money on sports then spend money on something I actually want to do. Like piano lessons or dance, I would even volunteer at my local pet shop!
