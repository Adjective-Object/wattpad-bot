Italy was surprised and got himself curious of the students' conversation. "Hm?" he tilted his head and began listening in on the conversation from afar.


"It's just a rumour. You're not really going, are you?" asked another student.


The girl with them shook her head. "There are ghosts, right? That sounds kinda scary..."


"It's true! Lots of people went missing and got eaten by this huge monster!" said their friend, making hand gestures to describe what he knew about the said topic.


One of the students nodded. "Let's check it out! Where is it?"


"If I remember correctly, I heard it was a really big western-style house north of here." answered one of the students.



That sentence piqued Italy's interest and got him thinking. "A haunted house...Even though we're in peace nowadays, I never get to play or have fun with the others...


And here I really wanted to be friends with them..." he said in a depressed tone.


He suddenly snapped his fingers and opened his eyes, showing his amber orbs lighting up. "Oh, I know! I'll tell America about it! If he tells the others about it, maybe they'll all get interested! Ahah, I'm so clever~

All right, as soon as the meeting is over, I'll--"



"ITALYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!" he suddenly heard someone shout angrily.


Italy turned to see that it was Germany, who seemed to be very frustrated. The Italian's spine shivered, as he was scared at his friend who was charging towards him. "VE!~ Eeeek! W-Why!?"

Germany grabbed Italy's arm and spoke, "So this is where you were hiding?! Stop fooling around and get back to training!"


"Eek! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! At least wait until I'm done eating my gelato!" the shaking Italian reasoned.


Germany shook his head. "You shouldn't even be eating before training! And I'm taking you back even if I have to drag you kicking and screaming!" he scolded, pulling Italy's arm in order to drag him back.
