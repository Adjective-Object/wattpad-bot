I say-skip car ride cuz I'm a lazy ass-We just got to the cheer gym.All the cheerleaders come running toward us and ask the guys for autographs.The guys reject them and sit on the bleachers.I heard one ask Shawn "Lets go out sometime,"the slut says.But thankfully Shawn says "I like another girl here I came with," and I started singing happy and dancing like an idiot.Then Kylie and I started doing warmups.I did a side cartwheel into a two backhand springs into a ariel.Then I turned and faced the guys and their jaws were on the floor.Then I turned to face Kylie she did three backhand springs into a back tuck into a ariel.We then lead actual warmups.Three backhand springs into a back tuck.Then we all did our routines perfectly we're ready for the competition.-skip to end of practice I'm way to lazy-"Alright girls see y'all next week at the competition."I sayѕнawn p.o.v.Mia is really cute.I don't think that Nash will let me go out with her.She's a really good cheerleader.мιa p.o.v.That was our last practice before the competition.If we have one Coach #thankscoach.We walk out to the car and her mom drives us all to my house.
