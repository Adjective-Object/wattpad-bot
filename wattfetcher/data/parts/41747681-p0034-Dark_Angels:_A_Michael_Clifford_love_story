She shrugs. "You have to be or people will take advantage of you. That's why I like being part of the Angels so much. People take one look at me and back away. I'm intimidating and I love it."
"You don't intimidate me one bit," Calum says, smirking. "In fact, I'm completely attracted to you."
Avery's face scrunches. "You can't be serious right now. If I punched you square in the face right now, you wouldn't be scared of me?"
Calum shakes his head. "Nope. It would hurt, don't get me wrong. I don't underestimate your strength, but no I wouldn't be scared of you. In a weird, twisted way, it'd make me want you more."
Avery crosses her arms and narrows her eyes. "I don't know what game you're trying to play, but you'd better let up."
Calum puts his hands up. "No game."
They look at each other silently, trying to figure out each other's next move. Then, out of nowhere, Avery lifts her fist and swings, only to have Calum catch her fist in his hand and back her up against the nearest tree. He holds both of her wrists above her head with one hand.
She looks at him, her breathing uneven, and swallows nervously. Calum, smirking again, leans in until their noses touch. "Don't worry," he breaths. "I won't kiss you until you ask me."
He can sense how nervous Avery is, and he lets her go. She continues to look at him, a mixture of confusion and lust in her eyes.
"C'mon, let's go." Calum says, walking off.
"Wait a minute," Avery yells, running up to him. "Where are we going?"
Calum grins down at her and throws an arm around her shoulder. "I'm taking you out for lunch, where else?"
Yeet I'm baaaack. Enjoy this chapter and spread the story!
