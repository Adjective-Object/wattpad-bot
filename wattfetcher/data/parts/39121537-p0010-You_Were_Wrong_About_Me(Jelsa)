"Hans."

"Yeah?"

"When we arrive in New York, can I get a new look."

"Sure, actually I think one of my stylists is here in California, we could do it before we leave for New York. Anything else?"

"Only one more, I want to go by the name Icy. At least when we are in public anyway."

"Anything for my almost sister." He chuckled, then shut the door.

I curled up in my bed, although I was alone and I left Anna behind, I was too relieved to grieve. I felt so free and relaxed. For once in my life, I can choose what I want to do, and I can have dreams of my own!

I instantly fell into the hands down best night sleep in forever.

Sweet dreams Elsa, and good morning Icy!

Anna's P.O.V.

I was furious! How could Elsa not approve of my dream relationship? Mark is a nice sweet guy, one day we will get married, and have a family!

I walk back into the party to find Mark sucking the face off another girl.

"Mark! What are you doing?!" I cried.

"Oh, I got tired of waiting for you to get back, so I moved on. If you want we could always do a threesome."

"So that is the only reason you wanted to go out with me, sex."

"Yep."

I ran to Punzie crying.

"Anna, what happened?"

"Mark cheated on me! He only wanted me for sex! Elsa was right!" I said crying into her chest.

Then all of the things we said and did to Elsa came back to me.

"Guy's we have to go and apologize to Elsa!"

They all looked at each other and nodded.

We drove to our house, and found it empty. Elsa wasn't home! Where could she be?

"Guy's!" Merida called, "You may want to see this."

I went to the kitchen where Merida was, and she was pointing to a note and my parents last testimate was next to it.
