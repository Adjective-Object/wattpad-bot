I walk into the loud, unsupervised class room. I walked around looking for a spot to sit, there was one empty table right by the window, perfect! I took the seat closest to the window and placed my bag hanging on the back of the chair, I just stared out the window and looked at the beautiful sight of a school parking lot, note the sarcasm on the word beautiful.This is when I don't try to fit in, I am a good two shoes when it comes to school, at home I don't care but here, getting caught, no, just doing it, whatever it is, will wreck me, I hate the idea of going to the office or getting detention or even just getting yelled at by a teacher is horrible. so I stay seated at my table of one and picked my nails, looked out the window and hummed a random song I herd on the radio, "Everyone, take your seats!" The teacher yells as she storms into the room, they all quickly obey and sit in there seats, "Welcome to your first day of school. As you all should know my name is Mrs. Kandella." "Hello Mrs. Kandella." everyone replies, she smiles and bows. "Please take your textbook in front of you and turn to-" "Sorry I'm late." We all turn to see who just barged through the door, "Hey Rylee." He gives me a wink. I slap my hand on my forehead, great just great. "Hello Mr. Pylina, please take a seat." she points at the seat beside me, wow, this day just gets better and better, that's sarcasm by the way if you can't tell. Well, hey, at least I know his last name now. He takes a seat beside me and the teacher continues class. After we get our first assignments 'Mr. Pylina' turns to face me he takes a breath to speak, "don't even talk to me." I say to him putting my hand in his face and staying focused on my textbook. He kissed my hand and I flinched it away as he chuckled. "I was going to tell you that you don't have to kiss me anymore to know my name but, if you're going to be like that." I looked up and faced him, "knew you'd be interested."
