"Hello Steve."
"Hi."
"I'm sorry Kevin hurt you."
"You are?"
"Yes, and also I'm sorry that you hurt me. I loved you Steve, since fifth grade. You helped me discover myself as a person then you hurt me more than anyone ever has. What you did was worse than being rejected by my parents, worse then being excommunicated, worse than my mission companion calling me disgusting. I kind of expected all of those things, I never expected this."
Steve tried to speak but Connor shushed him with a light kiss. "Goodbye Steve, I truly hope you find someone." He said, stroking his hand through the the long dark hair that he had once admired lovingly. Then he turned to go back to Kevin's room.
