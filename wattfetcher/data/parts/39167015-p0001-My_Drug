Jack Gilinsky
"where's Shaylee?" I asked Sammy
"she left" he sighed
"WHAT!WHEN!" I yelled jumping up
"this morning with my parents, something about them wanting her to have good grades some shit" he sighed again putting his head in his hands
I stayed quiet. To shocked to do anything.
"your girlfriend well ex now left Gilinsky because of me" Sammy sighed
Everyone raised an eyebrow
"BECAUSE OF ME THEY LEFT! AND TOOK HER WITH THEM!" Sammt screamed kicking his chair back and going into the house tears coming down his face
In the light of the fire all the guys saw one thing they haven't seen before. Me crying hard. She was gone. No trace on where she went.
