She sobs louder. "I'm so sorry."
"Shh, don't cry Cee. Don't cry."
"I don't know why I'm such a bad person. I am hurting so many people."
I pull away.
"What?"
She sniffs. "I'm going to have to leave this pack."
I stare at this beautiful angel in front of my and thank the goddess that I had a chance to know her. I hold her tightly to me, knowing that this will probably be the last embrace that I ever share with her.	"I love you," I whisper into her hair.
"Acis..."
"Shh. I love you so much." And I pull away.
I watch as she stands and runs away from me. Her petite body getting smaller and smaller in the distance. My heart shatters, and I know that no matter what, I cannot love anyone as much as my girl best friend and my first love.
But in the end she lied to me.
She hadn't found her mate yet.
