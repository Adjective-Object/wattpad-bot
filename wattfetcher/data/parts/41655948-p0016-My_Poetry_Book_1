I cannot stop writing.
Even in the bright light of dawn,
Pen in hand,
My hands tremble.I cannot stop writing.
Even when the darkness swirls around me,
To the point that I've forgotten
The position I'm in. I cannot stop writing.
Even when you're all
I've been thinking about
All day. I cannot stop writing.
Even when I'm too tired
To speak words aloud,
And the rain pours down on my soul. I.Cannot. Stop.Writing.
