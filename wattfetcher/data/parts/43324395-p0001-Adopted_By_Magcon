Avia's POVHi I'm Avia and I love to color everyone calls me the Artist. Sister Emily hates me I'm her "play toy" (hint the sarcasm). she always pulls me by my hair and she drags me. And she puts me on punishment if I don't do my chores,or what I'm told. Witch I hate it when she does that. I guess you could say I have a nasty attitude with her, but don't worry it's only her. I was drawing up in my room and she came up there. "What are you doing you brat I told you, you were on punishment didn't I" she said spitting on me. "Are you serious you just spit all over my sweat shirt you old hag" I said at her "GIVE ME ALL THESE CRAYONS YOU WILL NEVER IN YOUR LIFE DRAW AGAIN" she said still spitting on me "YOUR STILL SPITTING ON ME GET OUT" I spat back at her. She walked out of the room. "now what am I supposed to do"I mumbled to myself. I guess I could just read one of Suzan's books she's library girl here. I found a book called fancy Nancy she's really funny. I tiptoed down stairs after I heard the front door open then I saw 3 boys that were surprisingly cute.Cameron's POV I was reading a magazine and then I saw a picture of an orphanage and I saw pictures of girls and they were really cute. "hey guys I think we should adopt a child" I said "OMG YEAH I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING" Matt said "OKAY LETS GO SHOPPING" I said mocking Matt "okay teams, Nash,me and Carter are going to get the little someone and I'm going to call Mahogany so she can go shopping with Matt, Glinsky. (btw Johnson is at the studio recording). Sister Emily's POVThere were 3 boys that came into my office. "hello we would like to adopt a child" one of them said with short brown hair and brown eyes. "Well what are you interested in" I said hoping they wouldn't take Avia because I need to abuse her some more so she can learn her lesson. Then I saw her "what are you doing your on punishment" I said then the boys turned around in their chairs "your still spitting you old hag" she said "GET IN YOUR ROOM NOW" I yelled "NO YOUR STILL SPITTING STOP SPITTING ON ME YOUR RUINING MY SWEAT SHIRT" she said  "I like this one we'll take her" he said "what no you-I mean okay I'll get the papers" I said sounding mad.Cameron's POV While the witch was getting the papers we met Avia. she's really shy tho. "hi there I'm Cameron and this is Nash and Matt" I said "Umm hi" she said scratching her neck she had the cutest outfit on. And she was right that old lady was ruining her sweatshirt cause it had all these bubbles of spit on it. "Okay here's her dumb files" the lady said rudely "okay thanks" i said. I signed the papers and we left "go pack you dumb bags brat" she said Avia's POV After Cameron signed the papers I went to my room and packed then Sister Emily said something I couldn't here then she came up there. "hurry up I don't want you here anymore" she said "WELL OLD HAG IM LEAVING AND IM GOING TO HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE WITH THOSE BOYS" I said  "get over her now you little brat" she said and pulled my hair "CAMERON" I yelled and he came running "GET OFF OF HER" he yelled                   *after that*We were in the car and we pulled up to a gigantic house.Cameron's POVAvia was very shy so she stayed bye Nash's side the whole ride and they just mumbled to eachother. Then we got to the house and she had to sleep in Nash's bed because they were still finishing her room and she's scared of all of us other than Nash. Tomorrow we had tgt court so she can pick who's last name she wanted. I'm sure she's going to pick Nash's. After she fell asleep we all stayed up until we finished her room it was 4:45 am. We picked her up and put her in her room and she would see it when she wakes up and it will be a cute reaction.
