"JUSTIN ! WE'RE GONN-" Brianna Voice Was Cut off With A The Sound Of Crashing before The Her High Tower Of presents Started Tumbling Down On Them.
Lots Of "Ouch"s And "Ow"s Were heard as People Bursted Into Laughter. Some Were Even Rolling on The Floor laughing their Eyes Out.
"- Crash.." Brianna Mumbled Sarcastically, Pushing the Last Present Off her Face.
Her Brother, however, didnt Seem Annoyed By the Incident one Bit.
He, Too, Was Laughing with The Crowd Of People.
Brianna Couldnt Help But Let Out A Light Chuckle Before Joining Them In The Fun.
Something Inside Of Her Heart Tugged At his Smile, The Way He Cheers Up Every Soul with A Simple Smile Of his..
A Tiny, Familiar Voice Could Be Heard Whinning And Sobbing Lightly In The Background, Though.. It Was Never Heard.. Not Even By Brianna herself..
"Awww, You Little Brats.. Having Fun Without Me !" A Feminine voice Whined, Before A Beautiful Young Lady With Stormy Cystal Eyes Almost As Blonde As Her Hair Appeared Before us.
"DIA !" Justin Screamed Before He Attacked her In a Bear hug.
They Fell Backwards, Rolling on The Floor, Dianna Wincing Before She Hugged Him Stiffly, Arms Flailing Around As She Struggled to Push Him Off.
Staring At their Position Awkwardly, Brianna Managed To Push herself Up On Her Feet Again Before Clearing Her Throat.
"Damn, You're One hell of a Heavy Pig !" Dianna Squealed, Running out of breath.
Dianna tilted her head Slowly, Cocking an Eyebrow At Brianna Before Asking, " Well, Arent You Just a Lady ? Come And Help Me Push Him Off Me Before I Explode Out Of Embarrasment ! "
Shaking Her Head, A Small Smile Tugging Onto Her Lips, She Walked Towards Her Sister. Just As She Was About To Help Her Up, A Feminine Voice Called Out Her Name..
"The Cake's Here !"
"Where's Bree?"
"Oops, Sorry Not this Time Dia " Brianna stuck her Tongue out childishly Before Skipping To Where The Voice Was Coming From Excitedly, Samara And Janice Following Behind.
○▪○▪○▪○▪○▪
"Happy Birthday..." As They Sung Loudly, Wishing Brianna A happy Birthday obviously, She Couldnt Help But Stare Into Each And Every Person Around Her In Daze.
Dianna.. Her Cheerful And Cheesy Twin..
Justin.. Her Childish And Over-Protective Elder Brother And Partner in Crime..
Jayden.. Her Skillful Prankester And Party Animal, And With No Doubt, Just As Childish As Justin, His Twin, Can Be..
Jason.. Her Arrogant, Protective Elder brother Who Never got tired of picking On Her Until Today.. But Eh.. She Too Used To fake Cry And Get Him In Trouble When They Were Younger.
Janice.. The Famous Drama Queen, Damn, When Does She Ever Get Tired Of Her Pointless Drama..
Samara, Cameron, Lennon, Louis And...Wait Sonia ?
'Who Invited The Fugly Bitch here Anyway ?' She Thought Disgustingly..
She Hated Sonia.. Well Not exactly Hate but If She Had To Hug Her, It Would be With a Rope..Around Sonia's Neck..got the point There ?
However, She couldnt Help The feeling Of Sadness and Disppointment That Raided her body As Memories Of Aiken Replayed earlier.
