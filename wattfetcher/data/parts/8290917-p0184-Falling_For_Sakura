Hearts Broken

Hand in hand, James and Brenda walked up the stairs to their bedroom on the first floor. As they came into the room, they immediately saw the little card sitting on the large king-size bed.
James knew immediately who it was from and nearly broke down. However, he managed to control himself and picked up the card.
I love you, Daddy James and Mom Brenda. I will always be your daughter Sakura, no matter who I am or where I am.
Brenda came to read the card by her husband and gasped out in anguish, tears rolling down her cheeks. James took her into his arms as tears, too, rolled down his cheeks.

Nicolas came into his bedroom as he checked his e-mail on his tablet. Once he'd finished replying to the various messages that needed his attention pronto, he put down the tablet and finally noticed the pretty card that sat in the middle of his bed.
He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, wondering whom it was from. He picked up the card. It had a pretty hand-painted picture of cherry blossoms. He opened the card and read:
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
You forge your own destiny.
Sakura
Hand shaking, Nicolas whispered, "Sakura."

Tristan picked up the small, pretty card and read it. As he opened it, a photo slipped out and landed on the bed. He picked it up and saw it was a picture of him with Sakura and Logan. He and Logan were kissing her at Mary and Peter's wedding ceremony. He turned his attention to the card and read:
Sorry I slapped you that day in the library years ago.
I'm sorry I never got to know you better.
Sakura
"Sakura? What is the meaning of this?" Tristan said and read the card again.

Logan stared at the photo of him and Tristan kissing Sakura on her cheeks. "Sakura?" he said. Then he read the card again:
I will miss your laughter and your teasing.
I'm sorry I never get to know you better.
Sakura
"What?" Logan said. "This is no time for jokes, Sakura. When I see you tomorrow, I'll tell you how to do a proper joke."

Hayden stared at the little card and the small box sitting next to it, confused. He picked the card up, opened it, and read:
I love your motorbike and I love those wonderful rides near the cliff.
Sakura
Hayden picked up the box and found an earring. He gritted his teeth, his eyes dark. It was the earring she'd bought for him when they were children.
"Sakura," he said, clutching the earring in his hand.

Conrad cocked his head to one side as he looked at the pretty card sitting on his bed, wondering whom it was from. Grinning, thinking it must be one of the maids who just might have a crush on him, he picked it up and opened it.
My dearest Conrad,
