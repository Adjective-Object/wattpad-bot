"Look who's awake," a teasing voice said. Ian opened his eyes and saw none other than Jade staring down at him goofily. He didn't recognize where he was.
"Where am I?" Ian asked, sitting up and rubbing his eyes.
"Lay back down." She pushed Ian back down and he didn't try sitting back up again. "You fell asleep so I got help from Brad getting you down here into the cabin."
"Is Brad someone from your team?" he asked. I'm starting to get curious about her new friends.
"Yes, but don't worry about it now. You'll meet them all tomorrow. Get your rest for now." She put her hand on Ian's forehead and he closed his eyes again.
"Sounds good to me. What time is it?" he asked.
"Late. Good night," she said, kissing his forehead before he drifted off into another deep sleep.

A/N: Wow, this chapter was really short compared to what I've been uploading. Anywho, please vote if you enjoyed. Question Time: Do you like that Jovian and Jade are reunited? -Picture on side: Supposed to show SOMEWHAT show what the SS Hope looks like. To show things like size and all that.-~ Video on Side: "Falling In Love"-by Us The Duo.   I feel like this song just randomly starts playing in the background whenever Jade and Ian are with each other. "Hello mah lurv." "Why hallo to you too mah lurv."
