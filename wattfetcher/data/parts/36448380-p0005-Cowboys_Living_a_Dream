"Yes. I would love too."
"Ok meet me at my truck after you take a shower."
"Ok." Then I walk away to the locker room and I can feel him watching me. When I get to the locker room is empty and all the girl have gone home. So I take a shower and put on the extra pair of clothes that I had in my locker. I is getting cold out, because it is turning night, and I didn't bring a jacket. The best part is that the heat in my truck doesn't work so I am going to be so cold. I quickly put my long blond hair into a pony tail and go to my truck.
Ben is already there and sitting on the tail gate. I walk up to him and he jumps off. I hug him for warmth because I am in a tank top and shorts. I start to shiver. He takes off his leatherman jacket and puts it around my sholders. "Thanks." I say and smile. Then we hop into my truck and start it. I put his jacket on all of the way and it is really warm.
"Hey, will you call my mama and tell her we are on the way home?" I ask Ben. I can see him hesatate for a minute and then picks up my phone to call her. She picks up and he tells her it is him and that we are on our way. When we get home, we walk to the door hand in hand. I open the front door and everyone is in the house talking.
"Hey!!" They all shout at us as we walk through the door. My brother Mark walks up to us, as we are still holding hands.
"Finally! Are you guys dating?" He asks Ben and I. I look up at Ben then back at Mark.
"Yes. Yes we are." I say with the biggest grin on my face.
"Hey every one these two are dating!!" He shouts. Every one gasps and then comes to congradulate us. Well it is out. Now my whole family knows and soon the whole town.
