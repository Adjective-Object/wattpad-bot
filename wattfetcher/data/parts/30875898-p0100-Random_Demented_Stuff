Now I have a reason
To cut out my heart
To leave not just one, but a thousand ugly scars
Now I have a reason
To no longer care
Now I've lost the mean of life
Stuck in this fiery hell
Now I have a reason
To drown myself in tears
I've fallen so far under
The brave person's fears
Now I have a reason
To die right on this floor
To slam my head right into this door

But fuck reasons
I don't need to have one to fall asleep
To take a bottle of these devil pills
And lay down and weep
