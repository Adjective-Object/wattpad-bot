My stomach ruptured with fresh pain, and it was so consuming that it sickened every inch of me. It radiated and swallowed me whole, as if I didn't have a single bullet in my body but a hundred.
I heaved as if to vomit, as if I could rid myself of the bullet and the excess blood and save myself that way. The wind curled around me as though to embrace me, as though to try and pull me to my feet. There was a flavor of urgency in the misty gusts, and when I lifted my face, the first drop of true rain struck my cheek. I lifted my hand from where the hilt should have been, but the tiny trinket of Ra had returned to its original shape, a speck of gold amongst the blood.
My vision tunneled. My shallow breaths stopped in my throat as I choked and coughed on blood. I tried again to get up but my lead foot slipped. I toppled across the concrete. It happened so fast, and yet the sun had already split the horizon, and it was morning, and somewhere, people were going on about their lives, and my brothers were waking up, and I was here, bleeding to death.
It should have taken more than one bullet to kill me, but in reality, it was only one bullet in the right place.
My vision faded in and out. I was cold. So cold. I'd never known cold like I did now. Distantly, I heard the peppering of rain, but I couldn't feel it. I couldn't feel anything except my heart, pounding fiercely against my chest in a valiant fight to survive. Somewhere across the world, a train shrieked, the clouds rumbled, and my light went out.
