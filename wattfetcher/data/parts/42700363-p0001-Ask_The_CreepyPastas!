Me: So this is how it's gonna be then?
Shadow: Yea, every random thing we do is on here.
Jeff: That's a suitable thing to do.
Shadow: And so is this. *bites Jeff's arm*
Night: Was that really necessary?
Shadow: Obviously.
Peng: *Messing around with Edward the demon penguin*
BEN: And what is this even for again?
Me: Can't you read. This is like a truth or dare book.
E.j: *Jumps up from couch* Does that mean I can do surprise surgery?!
Night: Not unless your dared to do it. Then no you can't do it.
E.j: Aww okay.
Shadow: YES DO IT ON JEFF!
Jeff: WHAT NO.
Me: GUYS THINK OF THE REAL REASON WE ARE HERE!
Peng: DAD THERE AT IT AGAIN.
Slendy: Not again! *Faceless face palms* CHILDREN KNOCK IT OFF.
Shadow: Your as useless as the k in knock!
Slendy: THATS IT *Throws Jeff out the window.*
Shadow: IM A SURVIVER!!!
Me: *Face palm* So I have a question to ask Slendy. By himself.
Them: Ohhhhh.~
Me: WHAT THE DUCK HE'S OLDER THEN ME BY *Whispers* Infinity.
Slendy: *Glares and teleports everyone out of the room*
Night: That's not fair!
Peng: But dad!
Me: Ok so without any other interruptions. My question for you Slendy is, how do you feel if there wasn't CreepyPasta? Like if they actually got to live their lives normally.
Slendy: *Adjusts tie* Well... I guess I'd want uh Sally to see the rest of her life, For E.j t finish school and be a doctor, for Jeff and Liu to be happy together and for BEN to finally get the feeling of beating that video game.
Them: *From behind the door* HE REALLY DOES CARE!! *Hugs him*
Me: Aww Kawaii.
Sally: You really feel that way Slendy? Maybe there IS a way I can finish school....
-Five seconds later after that...-
Mrs.P: I'll be your teacher today kids! I'm-
Jeff: WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
Mrs. P: Do you wanna sit in the time out chair?
Shadow: *Whispers* YES!
Peng: *Petting Edward from within her backpack*
Mrs. P: Get up here then young man!
Night: He's anything but young.
Me: Ik wait until the next chapter when this all will make sense. :/
Peng: I have to use the barroom and I don't wanna hear any of the "May you use the bathroom" shit so bye. *Runs off with backpack*
Mrs. P: Ok what's this. *Points at board*
Jeff: *in the corner* A whiteboard.
Me: *whispering in the background* THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!!
