Going downstairs I stayed by the front door. The smell hit me even more. Then I heard Jaycie's voice.
"It's so nice to see you Kiara!!!! I've missed you so much." She said.
'Kiara' I thought.
My heart went into a frenzy. I was confused at this. I gripped my chest confused. What's going on? I leaned against the wall confused. I shut my eyes with a shake of my head. I stood up just as soon as Dad told me to hurry up. I walked outside and saw the girl. She was putting her helmet on her bike. When she turned around it was like the whole world stopped. She and I just stared at each other. All of the sudden her eyes were wide with surprise.
"This isn't happening." She muttered and that made me frown.
Some reason I was hurt by that comment. I paid no attention to my wolf as he was being straight up annoying as he was saying stuff and howling so damn much. I had frowned at her.
"What do you mean? What the hell is going on?" I asked.
"Don't play stupid. You know exactly what's going on. You know who I am to you." She grumbled only I looked to Dad.
"What is she talking about, Dad?" I asked.
"I don't-."
"DAD?!?" She said surprised as heck. "You're Jaycie and Paul's brother?"
"I'm their half-brother." I replied.
"Oh. Emm. Gee." She said.
Jaycie was confused.
"Dad, Kiara doesn't say that." Then she looked at me. "What is your wolf saying to you?"
I listened to him and he growled out mate. I was fairly confused.
"She's my mate?" I asked aloud.
Dad's eyes widen with excitement and happiness. He cheered at what I said.
"She and you are mates!" Dad yelled out to the world although he was confusing me.
She's my mate. Then I felt stupid as my eyes widen. I found my mate. Sure I didn't completely know what a mate was. It was true love, then that's all I know. I never really met another wolf besides Dad, Jaycie, Paul, and a few other people, but we never talked about mates.
"You say that like your confused." Kiara said.
"He doesn't know much. He had a human mother Kiara, but he is full wolf." Dad said.
"What?" Kiara said. "Does that mean he doesn't know half the stuff he can do?"
"What is she talking about? Do I have powers?" I asked almost getting excited. Jaycie grinned.
"We all have a gift. They're all different. Since I haven't shifted yet, I can't know about my power yet because I haven't shifted. Kiara tell him your power." Jaycie said.
"My power? Ugh... Lets not." She said.
"Lets." Dad said with a boyish grin.
"Derrick Landers Everheart. I will haunt your dreams if you..."
"She has the knowledge of all fighting skills and she can go into people's dreams. So when she says she'll haunt you in your dreams she means it." Dad said.
