14 days passed but nothing new happened, usual routine : Wake up, go to school, get bullied by Miley and Conor, sometimes punch them, get into the boring classes, get back home, feed my kitten, go to work, get back home and sleep.
Al hamdulillah, Elina have found the kitten in the garden. I checked the bracelet on its hand and it was the same as the name of the store I saw in the mall while I was leaving, I went to it again but the worker refused to tell the identity of the man who bought the kitten.
"Come on !" I sighed as I noticed that a chewed gum was stuck to my back, "I have had enough of those two" I walked in the school searching for someone, for the only one who would help me happily.
"Hey Robin" I waved at the red headed boy who I once saved from Connor's fist, "Oh hey, Ummm ... Leena right ?" He smiled, "Yes, and I need your help" I whispered, "I see, I think I know what you're thinking of, It will take me two days to get the thing ready" He smirked, "You're the best, make sure to make some worms involved" I whispered and he laughed out loud, "Whatever you say" He winked and headed to his class.
"Hey, Leena listen, I'm sorry but today I'm making this surprise party for Molly so please come for her, she'll be very happy" Simon said quickly and I had to stay silent for a while to understand what he was saying, "I'm sorry but I don't like music and dancing and drinking", "I know I know, that's why I didnt get any of those things, we'll just have a cake and there wont be many boys, you can just come for 5 minutes, please, do it for Molly" He ran to his PE class like a Ferrari.
"So, you going to Molly's surprise-party ?" Helen asked me, "I am" Diana answered, "Shut up, I'm asking Leena, So ?", "I donno, I don't like parties" I shrugged.
"Hey karate kid" Here comes Molly, "Hello empty-headed" I put on the fakes smile I had in my fake smiles book, "Did you take a bath today ? because it smells like garbage" She put her hand over her mouth and nose, "It's normal since you are here, come to my home and I'll give you a deodorant" and loud laughs echoed through the whole school from students from all ages.
"LEENA, GET DOWN HERE" Mrs.Carter shouted from downstairs, "I'M COMING" I put a blanket over my head and ran down, "Your friend is here" She said, "What frien- what are you doing here ?" I raised my eyebrow, "Shame on you Leena, is that how we welcome our guests ? have a seat young-man" Mrs, Carter left me with this stupid tall tanned beautiful young-man to get him a glass of juice.
"What is this blanket doing over your head?" He chuckled, "Shut up Simon, Damon is out in the room beside the pool" I walked to the stairs, "Sorry Sorry I wont laugh, I'm serious now, stop" I turned around but saw how hard he was trying to stop himself from laughing that his whole face turned red, "Okay, laugh before you choke, I know I look like grandmas" I sighed and pulled the blanket over my face and he exploded in laughter, "Okay, now, I came to remind you to come to my sister's surprise party at 6, it's Friday and it won't be a problem", "I don't know, I'll check if I got work today, my boss changed the schedule" I turned around, "Wait, take this, it will look better on you than the blanked, please put it on when you come to the party, please, you will like it" He gave me a white box then left quickly.
"He's willing to anger me" I walked upstairs and to my room then opened the box. A bright light came from the box and almost blinded me, "WHAT !" I pulled a golden dress, it's the same one he made me put on to see if it fits his sister, but why did he give it to me ? I'll figure it out.
"COME ON WE'RE GETTING LATE" Damon shouted at me and his sister and we ran downstairs, "Beauty takes time" Elina said, "Yeah yeah yeah WOAH ! Leena ! you look gorgeous" Damon's eyes widened, "Yeah yeah, take your eyes off me before I stick pen inside them" I threatened.
We ringed the bell three times until Simon opened, "Wellllllll- woah, It really looks good on you" Simon said, "We got some things to discuss about this" I raised my eyebrow, "Come on in" Simon opened the door widely.
