"Bro! What do you want?!" I yelled as I got up from the floor.
"What did Jesse say?" Alex asked.
"He said no." I answered.
"Great. Now you actually have a chance with him." Max blurted out.
"How many times do I have to tell you? We are just friends! Nothing else!" I blasted.
"Ok, ok. Don't lose your temper." Max said calmly.
"I'm trying not to." I replied.
"Good. Max, you better not do that again." Alex demanded.
"Fine. I won't do it again. We all know the end result of this." Max agreed. I scoffed and left them to go to my classes. Surprisingly, I had no work in my first 3 classes. But since there was no work, the morning was boring. Not that I wanted work. It was just boring. Luckily, lunch came and saved my life.
After I got my lunch, I sat with Alex and Max. We weren't talking to each other for a moment because we were all tired. Then, I saw Shawn coming my way.
"Hey." Shawn shouted as he came to our table.
"Hey." We all replied.
"Why do you tomboys look so gloomy?" Shawn asked.
"Just tired." Alex said slowly.
"Sure. Anyway, Charlie. Lily wants to talk to you." Shawn spoke up.
"Why does Lily need to see her?" Max came in.
"Why would I know? She just told me to get Charlie." He responded.
"Fine. I'll go." I gave in. I got up and followed Shawn to Lily's table. Her group of friends were all staring at me like I was a stranger. The Barbies. I hate every one of them. Except Lily. She's not a Barbie.
"Thanks, Shawn." Lily yelled as he walked away. "Charlie. Hi. Come sit here." She instructed me to sit next to her. I walked over to her until I heard a nasty remark from one of the Barbies, Lindsey.
"Ew! She smells and looks like garbage!" She tried to whisper.
"At least I don't look like a fucking Barbie doll." I threw back. Her face was so shocked. It was hilarious. I could tell she was trying to think of a comeback to throw at me.
"No comment? I thought so." I said as I sat next to Lily. "So what do you want to tell me?"
"I wanted to tell you that I've moved on from Jesse." Lily admitted. Her whole group started to clap like she just won an award.
"That's great." I said instead of clapping.
"But..." Lily started, "I like someone else now."
"Woah!" I interrupted. "You like somebody else already?!"
"Yeah. She just said that." said another one of the Barbies named Emma. "Try to keep up."
"Are you Lily?" I sarcastically asked.
"No. Obviously not." Emma answered.
"Yeah. Ok. So, shut up." I told her. I went back to Lily. "So, who do you like now?"
"Shawn." She automatically said.
"Really?!" I said surprisingly.
"Yes. I've always liked him, but I also liked Jesse." Lily responded.
"Then why did you ask Jesse out instead of Shawn first?"
"Because I wanted to see if Jesse had feelings for me, too, but I know that's hard to become one of Jesse's crushes. Now that I know, I have Shawn left as my only crush. That means I need your help again."
