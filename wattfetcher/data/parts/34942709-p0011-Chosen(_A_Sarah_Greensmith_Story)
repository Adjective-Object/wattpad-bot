When I woke up, I wasn't on a bed,instead I was floating over it. Doctors, nurses, and teachers were working on my shoulder. I floated toward the doors and saw my group out sitting in the sitting area, I guess waiting on news." Logan,sit down," Alex said to Logan who was pacing," we are all nervous, and upset."" Logan,you think you're upset," Page said," me and Kait had to watch it happen.""Then, you should of stopped it!" Logan yelled.The door opened and Professor Locksmen came out."How is she?" Chris asked." They're trying everything." Locksmen said, putting his hand on Logan's shoulder."I'm so sorry." Kait said to Locksmen."Dear, what happened to Sarah isn't your fault." Locksmen said, giving them a sympathetic look."But, they could of stopped it." Logan said." Logan, come with me." Locksmen said, taking Logan down the hall,with me following them.They stopped outside,by the fountains, Locksmen sat down, while Logan remained standing." Logan, I think you care more about Sarah then you had planned too." Locksmen said." I know your father wanted you to make Sarah to love you, and instead you fell.""I guess I did, and I never got to tell her." Logan said,rubbing the back of his neck."Sarah will make it." Locksmen said." She's strong and powerful.""How do you handle the deaths of people you love?" Logan asked." I just think of when I see them again." Locksmen said standing up."What if you dont?" Logan asked another question."Then, I find something new to think about." Locksmen said and walked away, leaving Logan to his thoughts.I felt a tugging sensation and I knew it was time for me to return to my body, because I wasn't gonna die quiet yet.
