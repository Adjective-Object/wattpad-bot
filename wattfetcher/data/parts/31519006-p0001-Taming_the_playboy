Ross Rider is the typical playboy, typical popularity man whore and typical handsomely handsome teenage boy that girls don't mind getting played by.
Until the new girl comes to school, and takes Ross on a journey he'd never had thought of. Could one girls attention take this playboy to extents he'd never thought he'd go on? Read ahead and find out.
