"Snow White and the Seven Knights," Hayden said, managing to hide a chuckle.
"Snow White and the Seven Knights?" Conrad laughed. "Sounds so clich√©."
Darcy wasn't paying attention to what Conrad said. In fact, if he were to pay attention, he would have jumped out of the closet and bashed his brother in the face for insulting his beloved project. He was, however, too busy trying to calm himself down from wanting the woman squeezing right next to him, tempting him with her soft body and spring scent.
The door closed. Darcy didn't move and stood there, gazing down at her.
Though she didn't want to move from the spot because it felt so right for them to just stand there, their bodies so close they could be connected, Sakura knew it wasn't right and thought perhaps Darcy was just dying to get out. So she cleared her throat and said softly, "I think they're gone."
Darcy got his wits back and reluctantly moved, pulling her along with him out of the closet.
Outside, Sakura didn't dare look at him for fear that his angry face would scare the hell out of her. Instead she picked up the socks she'd dropped and handed them to him. "Sorry I came in without permission."
Darcy wanted to tell her that she could come in whenever she liked, preferably at night, and that he wouldn't mind her sleeping on his bed either, like she had when they were children.
"Thanks for the socks," she said and hastily walked to the door.
Darcy desperately wanted to pull her back into his arms, but it seemed he couldn't move from his spot. He watched her go, his heart hurting so bad he wanted to cry in anguish.
Alone, he turned to gaze at the digital poster he'd drawn of the knight and the maiden. At the bottom, it read Snow White and the Seven Knights.
"Snow," he said softly under his breath.
