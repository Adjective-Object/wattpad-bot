I woke up to movement in the room. I leaned forward ready to defend myself. I noticed Dis put some clothes in my bag. I got up and went to help her. The clothes were in the bag. "Thanks Dis. I'm sorry for the sadness I cause you." I sighed. Dis looked at me in confusion then remembered what happened last night.
"It's alright. It isn't your fault. I will go to the entrance to say goodbye." Dis said then left.
I got dressed then grabbed my bag. I rushed to the entrance. Thorin and Dis were arguing. "Why do you blame me for your problems?! It is your fault not mine!" Dis yelled.
"You could have let her sleep so that I could leave without her! She is a burden to me!" Thorin yelled back.
They're talking about me. I thought tears forming at my eyes.
"You really know how to push people away! You are even pushing the girl away because of who she reminds you of! Why do you think Gandalf wanted her to come with you?!"
"That does not matter! I won't bring her with me!"
"You don't have to! I chose to come! I wanted to help with getting the company together! It's not Dis's fault! It's yours! You won't realize the blessings you have until you lose them! Your pride will be your downfall!" I shouted gaining a lot of attention.
I stormed over to the stables. Tears continued to fall. Fili and Kili came over to me. Fili handed me a throwing knife belt filled with throwing knives. Kili gave me a bow and a quiver full of arrows. I hugged them both. "I will miss y'all. See ya both at the meeting." I whispered. The two brothers left. Dis came up to me with the necklace from my dream.
"I want you to have this. My mother gave it to me and told me to give it to my daughter. I don't have one so I will give it to you. Both of my sons love you like a sister. That is good enough. I want you to remember me by this." Dis smiled and put the necklace on my neck.
"Thanks Dis. I will treasure it always." I thanked her.
Thorin walked by. I knew that is was now time to leave. We were leaving the Iron Hills to continue on to get more members for the company.

Hi. Now you know where Michelle got the necklace from. If I let Kili live, who should I let live out of Thorin and Fili? Michelle can only have one husband. There will be moments that will make her decision hard. Don't forget to vote and comment. I already have an idea for the second book. -Faith-
