" hey " they said at the same time
" ok everyone to the pool" chaz yelled and everyone ran off towards the pool but me and Justin
Justin started to walk off and I grabbed his hand
" Justin what's wrong " I asked with worry in my eye
"Nothing " he hissed
" can't you just leave me be and join the rest of them "he yelled raising his voice
Which made me jump Justin has never raised his voice and me then tears formed in my eyes
And I turned around and started walking then Justin grabbed my arm and spinned me around so I was face to face with him nose to nose then descended towards my lips
" don't leave me I didn't mean any of that " he said against my lips
" Justin what's wrong " I asked once more hoping now he would give me the answer
" the way that guy looks at you pisses me off and you don't realize it " Justin said angerly
" Justin I love you and only you ok get that " I said planting a kiss on his lips and wrappedmy arm around his neck and deepened the kiss then I felt his hands go to my cheek then down my body and stopped at my hips and I grinned through the kiss and pulled away
For air and leaned our foreheads against each other
" I love you " he said
" I love you with no spaces "I said while smiling wide
" your so cheesy " he said
" I know " I said pecking him on the lips then pulling him to the pool
"Come on " I said dragging him
" on one condition you swim with me " he said
" noo" I whined
" ok I guess I'll go watch TV " he said trying to leave.
" fine I'll swim only for a little while"I said trying to pull him again
" Kylie " the girls said waving me over
" yeah where have you been " they said eyeballing me
" with justin " I said giving them a confusing look
" are y'all together " they asked
" yeah " I said smiling
" about time " Sutton. Said
" so who asked who out" Alison asked
" he asked me out " I said.
" oh how cute " Hannah said
" I guess " I said
" do you love him " Sutton asked
" well yeah why wouldn't I he's my everything " I said
" aww " they said in awe
" well I'm gonna sit with justin " I said walking off
" hey baby " he said pulling me on his lap
" hey " I said
" let's go swimming " he said
" ok " I said taking off my slip over and I laughed as justin looked me up and down and bit his lip.
" my eyes are up here babe " I joked
" let's go " he said pulling me in the water
