"You got it."
"Alright I'll see you in like three minutes."
"Okie dokie." He said and hung up. I slipped on some shoes and grabbed my lanyard and phone and practically ran to the venue. I will kill Marcie if she touches a single fucking thing. I arrive quickly and ran to the merch booth.
"Marcie don't you dare touch anything!" I yelled as soon as I reached the booth.
"I didn't! Get off my ass Kellin!"
"Just shut up Marcie." Jason said looking over at her annoyed.
"Oh god shut up Jason." She said rolling her eyes.
"Sorry I'm late." I told them rolling my eyes.
"Its fine, Josh was doing most of the work anyway."
"Thanks Josh." I said gratefully. "What's left to be done?"
"Just posters and CD's."
"Alright I'll get those then." I told them and went to the boxes and started to unpack everything.
"You got it boss."
I nodded not bothering to respond and picked up another box when it was taken away from me.
I looked up and found Vic taking the box from me, "Babe you can't take all of my boxes." I said rolling my eyes.
He smiled, "Too bad because I am."
"Vic you do realize that this is my job right?"
"And that doesn't stop me." He told me and kissed my cheek, "Now where does this go?"
"In the corner by the shirts."
"Alright, I'll take it over there." He told me, "So are you feeling better now?"
"Yeah a bit."
"Good, I didn't like seeing you worry like that." He said as I led him to where the merch needed to go.
I shrugged, "Thanks for helping me with the boxes."
"Its not a problem babe."
"Well it's sweet," I told him as he set it down and I started unpacking it. "How was your interview and the signings and all of that other shit that you had to do?"
"As far as I know everything went well except the photoshoot considering the photographer was late and was extremely bossy too."
"Who was the photographer? I'll go yell at them."
"It was Alan but I don't blame him he seemed really pissed off about something when he did get there and he wasn't in the mood for anyones shit."
I frowned, "I'll talk to him about it before the concert starts or something." I told him laying out the bracelets.
"I don't know if you should, he barely said a word today beside like what to do or something. He was snappy even with Austin since he came to pick Alan up to walk around after."
"Nothing his best friend can't fix." I told him and finished arranging everything on the table. "How much longer before your meet and greet?" I asked him. "Or did that already happen?"
"I have about five minutes I think."
I sighed, "Well I'll take what I can get."
Vic smiled and pulled me to him, "Sounds perfect."
