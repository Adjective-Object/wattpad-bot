Italy noticed his friend in deep thought and nudged him, "Japan? You're frowning..."


"Italy, how do you go back in time?" Japan asked.


The Italian raised an eyebrow but answered, "Er, well, there's a clock somewhere in this house. A really huge one. All I have to do is rewind it."


".......A clock?! Could it be...?" (Name) thought, her eyes widening.


Japan tilted his head. "Is that big clock in a different place each time?"


Italy nodded and replied, "Yeah, that's right. The first time around, it moved so that I could escape, but whenever someone fell, I would go after it and it'd be in a different place.


Sadly, it's the one sure way to escape."


"You mean... for everyone... right? Surely you're including yourself in that?" Japan asked, furrowing his brows.


Italy looked away. "Oh... er... well..."


Japan gently placed a hand on his friend's shoulder and made him face him. "......Italy, do you remember the question I asked you earlier?"


"Question...?" Italy tilted his head in puzzlement.


"I asked you if you were... hurt somewhere." Japan said.


"Oh.

Yeah, I remember." The Northern Italian told him.



Japan took a deep breath. "I'll rephrase my question, Italy."


"O-okay..." Italy nodded.


"Is there somewhere you want to be?"Â Japan asked, giving a caring smile.


Italy's eyes began to water. "Japan..."


"Please answer... Italy." his friend pleaded.
