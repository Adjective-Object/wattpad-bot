We were only five when we met. We never knew what fate had instore for us. "Hello what is that you are doing?" He asked me"I'm doing chores. What is your name? Mine is Aribella. You can call me Ari.""Nice to meet you Ari. My name is Logan. Would you like some help?" That was the beginning of our friendship. He would come help me with chores and I would teach him new games. It only lasted a year or two before his visits would be less and less often. He never knew how I felt about him and I tried to forget. I was doing so well when he saw me there that night.
