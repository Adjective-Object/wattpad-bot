Jordan's POV
Erin got x-rays of her arm and we cried a little when we saw them.
"Alright. The x-rays are finished, you can stand up now." Dr. Callen said.
"Mommy?" Boo asked when Erin stood up and had tears falling from her face.
She half hugged her and I with her good arm.
"Okay, you can follow me and we'll take a look at your arm." The doctor said.
"Jordan, what if my arm is broken?" She asked.
"I don't know, oh jeez." I said as Boo squeezed my hand even tighter.
We took a look at the x-rays.
"So, I see something right around here." Dr. Callen said as she pointed to around Erin's elbow.
"Is it bad?" Erin asked.
"It's all I see, a small fracture." She said.
"Would she need a cast?" I asked.
"Yes. For just about two weeks, she would wear a cast." Dr. Callen told us.
"Can she still do stuff with it?" Boo asked.
"Oh sure, just not everything." Dr. Callen said.
"Good." Said Boo.
"Your daughter is so cute." She said directing it to both me and Erin.
"She's n -- " I started.
"Thank you." Boo and Erin said.
"But I'm not your dad." I said to Boo.
"Kind of you are." Boo said.
"I -- okay."
Erin's POV
Well, I have a broken arm in a cast.
"Isn't he kind of my dad?" Boo asked.
"I guess." I replied.
"Sorry, I assumed." Dr. Callen said.
"It's fine." He said.
once we finally got home, it was already ten o'clock. Boo should be in bed. I told Boo to get ready for bed and she asked if Jordan and/or I could lay with her.
"I gotta leave, Boo." He said.
"Aww, do you have too?" She asked.
"Yeah do you have too?" I asked making a really sad face.
"You guys are so cute. I guess I can stay for a little bit longer." He said.
"Oh yay! Thank you, Jordan." I said. I kissed him as a second thank you once Boo left the room.
"I guess I kind of have to stay another night. I mean, my girl just broke her arm! I can leave now." He said.
