So this will just be some poems and stories and quotes and song lyrics and whatnot about suicide and heartbreak and self-harm and depression.
Some of this I write and some of this I find online.
Hopefully it'll help you the way it helps me.
If you ever need to talk I am always here <3
Also, please feel free to send me poems/quotes/lyrics etc that you like and or wrote and I'll be more than happy to post them :)
*could be triggering*
(Send your own work I'd love to add it to my collection--and give you credit of course!)
