America clenched his fists. "I'll go to the annex."


Italy couldn't help but look at America with sullen eyes.


Japan tilted his head. "Is that...so? Then-"


"Wait! I'll go instead of Japan! So it'll be just me, America, and England. We'll make sure to fully search the annexe, and hopefully find the bella ragazza." Italy told him, giving a slightly crooked smile.


England raised an eyebrow. "Are you strong enough for that? I mean, if their base is really there, it'll be quite dangerous.... In that case the three of us will go."


"Ehehe, I look forward to working with you two. ..." Italy smiled.

Italy walked up to Germany by the crates in the top left corner of the room.

"Now we have more clothes and persona objects. I organised them and put them in separate drawers. Yours are here." Germany told him, pointing at the second drawer.


Italy nodded. "Okay!"


As Germany went to organise the other drawers, Italy opened his drawer and looked inside. It was some extra clothes, some of his old white flags, and other usual stuff he had. But there was something shiny that caught his eye.


"Oh...This..." he said, marvelling at the object. "I wasn't able to return this. Hmm...better bring it with me so that I won't forget."


He then put the object in his pocket and closed the drawer. After that, he walked down to Prussia and Romano at the table in the bottom left corner of the room.



"He's fixing my weapon. I did take good care of it, though." Romano told his younger brother.


Italy nodded. "Prussia is so good with his hands, isn't he?"

((That's what he said. //shot. sorrynotsorry))


"Yeah. Oh, by the way...We left the monster there when we disappeared. It's definitely lurking there somewhere. Be careful. Also, if you find the ragazza, just take her with you and run back here." Romano instructed.
