"3 others? "
"Yep! Until then, Smile will guard you. When they arrive, Smile will have leave to come and catch up with us." Masky continued.
I looked over at Smile. "Smile had to leave to?" I thought to myself. I was surprised that Grinny didn't have to come with them. I guess he's lucky.
"When will you guys leave?"
"Later on tonight....."
I sighed. "Alright then......"
I didn't understand it. What is this important business they all had to take care of? Where were they all going? Who were these "3 others"? Where did Jane go? Who was this "old friend" she had to see? Why did it have to take a week to visit her friend? These questions ran through my head as I sat on the couch. This was all happening too quickly.
I just shrugged it off and continued to watch TV with Smile next to me.
Later on that night, Masky, Hoodie, and Toby were preparing to leave. I gave them all hugs as I watched them walk out the door with their backpacks. When they were already outside, I remembered to tell Toby something.
"Hey Toby!" I called out.
He stopped walking and turned around to look at me.
"Natalie says Hi!" I told him.
He then smiled. "Well, t-tell her I s-said hi b-back!" he answered. Then he continued to walk with Masky and Hoodie.
Sometimes I think Natalie and Toby like each other, but I would never tease them about it. Never! Cause if I ever did, it wouldn't end well.......So I just stay quiet about it.
I stood at the doorway; watching them on their way until I couldn't see them anymore. I looked down and looked at Smile right beside me. He began to yawn and so did I. I decided to go to bed early. It was a tiring that day. I walked back inside the house with Smile and closed the door behind me.
I looked around the house for a silent moment. It was just me, Smile, and Grinny. For now......
I had no idea who were the others that would watch over me. I didn't understand why I had to be watched over anyways. I was only 17! I didn't need anyone to protect me. But then again, I remembered who I was living with. I sighed and turned off the TV.
I walked upstairs as Smile followed me up. Grinny just slept on the couch for some reason. I went into my room and decided to call it in for the night. I got into my pajamas as usual and climbed into bed. Smile climbed in as well. I turned off my lamp and layed quietly in my bed. Smile fell asleep fast, but I didn't.
I was tired, but i didn't fall asleep quickly. I then felt my eyelids get heavy. But before I could close my eyes and fall asleep. I saw a dark figure at my window. Judging by the distance, the figure was really close to the window. I didn't see what who it was because the curtain was covering it, but I could tell it was male. Then I saw the figure move away from the window.
I wasn't worried, scared, or confused. I was just to tired.......So I just closed my eyes..............and went to sleep.
