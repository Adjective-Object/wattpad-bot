Sure, a couple of the school bullies would flirt with me once in a while, but never in my life would I go out a stupid jerk. Plus, I just know that they would only flirt with me just so that I wouldn't stand up for Steven. It's really pathetic if you ask me.
When the bell rang, everyone rushed out of the door to enjoy the weekend as usual. As me and my friends walked outside, Steven walked to the buses while me and Natalie walked to the student parking lot. Now that we were all in high school, Natalie's mom didn't have to drive us anymore. Natalie got her drivers license and started driving me to school everyday as she still does now. It's pretty awesome!
We walked to the student parking lot and found Natalie's car in the same spot that it was parked in everyday. Natalie pulled out her keys and unlocked the car doors. As always, I got in the front seat and Natalie, of course, got in the driver's seat right next to me. We closed the car doors and buckled our seat belts. Natalie started up her sweet ride and drove out of the parking lot.
As Natalie was driving, I saw that I got a text on my phone. When I was about to pull it up and read it, something happened that caused Natalie to hit the brakes, making me back up in shock.
"USE A TURN SINGLE YOU JERK!!!!" Natalie screamed at the other driver.
I couldn't help but laugh as Natalie continued with her driving. "You're probably gonna get a ticket for criticizing other drivers like!" I warned her.
"Yeah! Well excuse me if other people are idiots when it comes to driving!" she protested.
I laughed once more. No matter what, Natalie criticizing things is funny. I put away my phone, thinking that I'll read the message later.
"So, what are you doing for this weekend?" Natalie asked.
"Well, Jeff says he's gonna take me deeper into the forest to check out of waterfall!" I told her.
"Waterfall?"
"Yeah! He's says that he took a walk into the deeper part of the woods and found a beautiful waterfall. He says he's gonna take me there to see it!"
"Awesome! Can I come over and see it, sometime?"
"Sure!"
"Cool!" Natalie commented.
"What about you? What are you going to be doing?" I asked
Natalie sighed. "Nothing...."
"Well you seem depressed about it. What's wrong?"
"My parents are going on their business trips for an entire week."
"What? Why?"
"My Mom is going to get an interview for her latest book and since my Dad is the engineer of some lame company, he has to go somewhere to do some boring engineer work." Natalie explained
"So, your gonna be alone in your house for an entire week?!?!?" I asked in concern.
"Yep...."
I was a little concerned about Natalie being alone for a week, so I thought and thought about how to help her. "Hey! I have an idea!" I said.
