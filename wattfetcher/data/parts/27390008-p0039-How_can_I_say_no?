"More than you could ever imagine." Johnny whispered. I ran my fingers through his hair. It had grown out since I'd moved in with him and I was just noticing now. "I'm sorry." He said again.

"Johnny, stop apologizing about your arm." I said.

"Not about that. I maybe sorta kinda read your diary." Johnny said. I giggled. "What?"

"I figured as much when i saw you standing there with roses and my teddy bear." I said. Johnny smiled.

"That's also how I knew to find you here. Before I'd only read some to find out what to do for today but then I was reading it to find out how to make it up to you and I saw you'd already been up here. I admit I was disappointed I couldn't show you but I'm glad you like it up here." Johnny said. I smiled.

"It's just so beautiful. I love it. You know that day I disappeared for like half the day?" I asked. Johnny nodded. "I came up here to read and lost track of time." Johnny laughed.

"That is so you. Hey look. The sun's setting." Johnny pointed out over the city. I laid my head on his shoulder and we watched the sunset. As the sun disappeared Johnny kissed my temple. "So are we good? Not going to break up?" He asked. I shook my head.

"No. We're good. I think I'd go so far as to say we even have better understanding of each other." I said. Johnny smiled.

"I agree. So does that mean I can kiss you?" Johnny asked. I nodded and Johnny leaned in. Our lips met and everything disappeared. "Come on. Let's go home and eat. I know I messed up today so I'll make that fancy dinner I promised you tomorrow. Let's just go to burger king or McDonalds or something." Johnny said once he pulled away. I giggled and nodded.

"That's fine with me." I said. Johnny helped me up and we walked back to the house. We stopped at burger king and got our dinner. We sat in the kitchen and ate in silence. I kept thinking about how he had already put so much effort into making sure us stayed us. I smiled at the thought. Johnny really was worth it.

"Uh Samantha. I was wondering if you wanted to maybe........You know what forget I even said anything." Johnny said. I watched him as his cheeks slowly became pink.

"Aw! That's so cute!" I squealed. Johnny looked at me like I was crazy.

"What is?" He said. I gently touched his cheek and watched as they started to turn red.

"Aw! Why are you blushing Johnny?" I asked. I was smiling. He was just too cute right now. I could get used to seeing Johnny blush. Especially if it was because of me. Johnny's eyes widened and he touched his cheek. I quickly took out my phone and took a picture seeing as I might not get to see this again any time soon.

"Fuck." Johnny swore. I giggled as he looked away from and focused on his food.
