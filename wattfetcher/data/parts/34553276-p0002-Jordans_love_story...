After watching them I turned my attention back to hannah. She was in the far end of the cylinder crying.
"Hannah call for help!" I told her.
" I can't. My phones at home.." She said in between sobs.
" Use mine" I said while reaching in my pocket and coming up empty.
" What the heck? Where's my phone? " I asked. I looked back out and saw it on the ground right in the middle of the fight.
" danget, now what? " I asked but knew it was no use. She couldn't help me in the state she was in. I checked my surroundings only to find some dirty pipes at the end.
Suddenly all the noise was cut off.
I peeked out to see all robots were destroyed. And the turtles were talking.
The red one looked on my derection and gasped. I quickly hid back in the cylinder.
Footsteps drowned out the pounding in my ears. I grabbed the metal pipe that was at the end of the cylinder and crept forward to the opening.
As soon as the first turtle face came to view I tackled.
He wasn't expecting it so he tumbled out.
I landed on top of him but he held me in his tight grip.
" I like this position." He said with a smirk.
" Well get over it!" I yelled and wiggled out of his grip. When I was free I swung the pipe at his face.
It pounded into his head fast and hard.
Once it hit I stood up and ran to the cylinder again. I stood protectively infront of it so. No one could get in or out.
Hannah suddenly screamed from inside.
"HANNAH!" I screamed a blood curling scream, and dove in to save her. Two giant arms wrapped around my waste and drug me out.
I soon found out that red head was holding me.
" LET ME GO! NOW!"I yelled furious.
I looked up at him and saw the bloodied gash I had made. I winced looking at it.
Hot head seemed to notice because when I looked up he looked slightly concerned.
I looked away and at the entrance of the cylinder to find orange carrying hannah.
" Hey let go of her." I said but they all just lauph ed at my sentence.
" I'm sorry you misunderstood me. I said LET GO OF HER NOW!"
My response was nothing. I could still hear Hannahs sobs, and it hurt because I couldn't so anything about it.
As anouther wave of sobs began orange dude ran to her side and was trying to calm hannah. What?
Red slightly moved me into a comfortable position,Â  but when he did I cried out in pain.
"JORDAN! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER!" Hannah screamed.
Red set me down on the ground and was about to lift up my shirt before I shoved his hand away.
"Go to far up or look to long and I will hurt you." I warned him through tears. He held bo fear in his eyes at my warning. Just concern and worry.
He slowly lifted my shirt and gasped. I heard 5 sets gasps from hannah and the turtles.
