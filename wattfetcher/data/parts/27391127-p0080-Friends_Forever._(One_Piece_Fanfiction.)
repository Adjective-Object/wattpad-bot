"Liar." Aya answered poking her cheek. Sakura just put the photo back on her dresser.
"We gotta go now. Haruka is complaining about something again." Aya cheered. Sakura just looked at her before hopping off her bed and grabbing the suitcase. They then ran out the door and met with a very impatient Haruka.
"Y'all fucking bitches finally arrived." Haruka muttered, passing her hand through the hair. Sakura merely apologized and Aya slapped him.
Nothing of the unusual. They then walked down the cloudy road, greeting their neighbours and shopkeepers. They then reached the train station . After showing their tickets, Sakura and Aya sat on the bench whilst Haruka leaned against the metal pole.
"Damn, this train is taking a long time."
"You're very impatient today Haruka, is something wrong?" Aya asked from the bench. Haruka looked at the two on the bench before quickly turning his head.
"Its nothing. The train is just taking a long time." Haruka answered.
"Liar." Sakura stated, poking his cheeks,"You face is red."
Haruka turned around before....
"DON'T FUCKING TOUCH MY FACE, YOU BITCHY LIZARD!"
"DON'T FRICKIN' YELL AT ME YOU DEMONIC PIECE OF SHIT!"
"FUCKING TOAD"
"BITCHY BRAT."
"Would the two of you..." Aya started appearing behind them, "SHUT THE HELL UP! YOU'RE DISTURBING THE PEACE"
During this 'fight', the train master just sweatdropped, " But she's the one making the most noise."
-------------
The Sea-Train finally pulled up into the station and the reaction was almost as expected. As soon as Haruka walked into the train, all the girls started fangirling.
"Haruka-senpai!"
"Haruka-senpai, look at me!"
"Sure, anything for you, my love." HAruka answered, passing his hand through his hair. The poor girl nearly died from sheer sexiness.
Meanwhile, Aya got various comments such as ," You look marvellous today, Aya-chwan!"
"Thank you."
Sakura just walked past the commotion saying an occasional, 'Tch' at the comments. She then settled herself into one of the many semi-soft leather seats of the Sea Train.
"Hello Saki-chan." Luffy called showing his head above the seat. He was eating a piece of meat and had violently tear a piece off the poor giant drumstick after he greeted her.
"Hello, Luffy." Sakura replied smiling. She learned it'd be best to let Luffy call her that name since she has realized that she isn't the only person who's name he cannot pronounce properly.
"Here, I brought meat for you!" Luffy exclaimed handing her an equally big piece of drumstick.
"Arigatou, Luffy!" Sakura exclaimed with sparkles whilst hugging him. However, the rest of his crew were utterly shocked, heck even Zoro was shocked which was rare.
"Did he just-" Nami asked before he was cut off by Ussop.
"Impossible!"Usopp screamed, his tongue flowing in a zigzag pattern.
"Luffy, are you alright? Do you have a fever?" Chopper asked, checking his temperature.
"What' your problem?" Luffy asked.
