"What?" I asked and looked away from him to find the two making out like there's no tomorrow. "Well that's disturbing."
"Oh my."
"They're really getting at it." I said and looked away before I got sick.
"I know, kinda wish I could make out with someone." He said and laughed.
"Yeah, you're not the only one." I muttered.
"What was that?"
"Hm? Oh nothing."
"Well I'm gonna go take pictures and stuff."
"Alright, have fun. I think I'm going to get me a drink." I told him.
"Have fun." He told me and walked off.
"Oh I will." I said to myself and headed off to the drinks.  That ginger was fucking around with me all the time. Being all cute and saying shit like that.  It .just makes me want him even more.
"What's got you all flustered?"
I groaned. I knew that voice way too well, "Jaxin what the hell are you doing here?"
"I heard you guys were here so I thought I'd show up and talk to you since you won't answer any of my calls."
"Maybe because I don't want to see you or talk to you. Hell I don't even want to be around you Jaxin. Please just leave."
"Not until you give me another chance." He said not moving.
"I'm not giving you another chance."
"Why not? We were so good together." He said grabbing my hand.
"Jaxin..."
"Come on Aust," He said getting closer to me. "I miss you."
"Jax, I can't."
"Give me one good reason why you can't."
"Because you always cheat on me."
"I won't cheat on you this time, come on Austin I miss being with you."
"You mean it this time?" I asked biting my lip.
"Yeah I do." He said, "Please take me back."
"Okay, I will."
Jaxin grinned, "Really?"
"Yeah baby, I've missed you." I told him. I don't know what I was thinking when I was taking him back.  Jaxin smiled at me and leaned up kissing me softly.
"Thanks for taking me back."
"Anything for you." I told him smiling.
"Wanna go somewhere private?"
"Not right now, but later."
"Oh come o-"
"Austin." I looked over and saw Alan standing there, "Who is this?" He asked.
"This is my boyfriend Jaxin." I told him.
"Oh, uh hi Jaxin, I'm Alan."
"Uh huh same goes to you." He said and turned back to me. "Please Austin! We haven't been alone together in so long!"
"Later we can." I told him, "What did you need Alan?"
"I just wanted to show you something, but it can wait. You guys, uh, have fun."
"It's fine, you can show me now." I said.
"No, no its fine. I'll leave you with Jaxin." He said slowly walking away.
