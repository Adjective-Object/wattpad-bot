"Okay go ahead babe" Nathan said while he started signing us both in, "see ya in biology" I said walking down the hallway. "DESI" my bestfreind and also cousin Taylor yelled walking out of her class, "hey Tay" I said walking up and starting to open my locker, "omg have you seen luke today" she said leaning against the wall. "Oh my god so he looked at you once" I said, "yeah but he's so hot" she said as the bell rang for 3rd class. Mine was Art. Ugh. And who did I have it with. The magical Luke. "Your so lucky you get to see him" she said walking with me through the hallway, "yeah Taylor because at 9:30 in the morning the thing I'm thinking about is luke. Besides have you seen the dark haired boy who's been hanging out with Michael. Now him I wouldn't mind seeing" I said as I turned around at the art door to talk to her. "You mean the boy Nathan's been messing with" she said typing a text, "what no Nathan's not like that" I said defensively, "oh well he is to that Calum" she said putting her phone away, someone slammed the art door behind me, "we'll talk at lunch" I said turning to the door, "see ya in an hour" I said opening the door "and a half" she said turning and smiling. Oh great the only seat left was beside Luke, "hey Luke" I said sitting down, "wow she's late for the millionth time. Let's get around of applause" he said smirking and the stupid whores at the table clapped and made love looks at him. "No really good to see you des, honestly it's been awhile" he said leaning back in his chair, "MR. HEMMINGS WOULD YOU LIKE DETENTION" our teacher Mr. Lavarsky yelled, "no" Luke said lowering his head. "HOW ABOUT YOU" he said turning to me, "no thanks" I said getting out my phone. "Wow what's up hectors ass" i sent to Luke. He look at the text and smiled and then put his phone away.
