I woke up by the light from my window. I mumbled to myself,"Why does school exist? I hate it so much." I grab my phone to check on my social media's to see if anything important was going on.
When I realized there wasn't anything important, I get my clothes and head for the shower. I decide to wear skinny jeans, a white tank top, and a black biker vest. With my black converse.
Once I get out of the shower and blow dry my hair, I start to curl it. After that, I pin one part to the side of my head. When I get done, I put on my shoes and backpack and get out of here.
"Morning, mom. What's for breakfast?"
"Anything you want me to fix."
"Ok. Ummmmmm, can I have Cherrios?"
"Yeah. Go sit down and I'll bring it to you."
"Ok." I sit down at the bar table where we usually eat and check if I did all of my homework. I did all of it so I'm good.
"Did you do all of your homework?"
"Yes, mom."
"Good. Here is your cereal."
"Thanks. Oh and by the way I'm taking my car to school."
"Ok. That's fine." I start to eat my cereal and finish it within four minutes. I run out of the house grabbing my keys. I open my door to my deep red fushion, and get in.
"Alright... let's get to school." I back out of the garage and pull out to the road. then I start to drive towards school. I drove until I seen the big sign that said 'Woodrow High.'
I parked in the first spot I see and head towards the doors. "Hey, Maria."
She turned around. "Hey Ally. Ready for class?"
"No. I gotta put my book bag in my locker and get my books and pencil."
"Oh ok. I'll come with you towards your locker."
"Okayyy... if you say so." As I open my locker, she starts to scream, which brought attention over to my locker.
"Omg! You have Caleb in your locker!!!!"
"Yeah.. I mean he's cute and everything, but I won't ever get a chance with him."
"Hey. Maybe you can get to be partners in the new project Mr. Hemings is assigning. He's in the same class so you can probably get him!"
"Omg you're right! I can't wait for English!" The bell rang and I headed to class with hope.
"Good morning, class. Today I will be assigning you a partner and a project so be ready when I call your name." I crossed my fingers and hoped to be partners with Caleb.
"Ally and Caleb. I want you to do the book on Romeo and Juliet." And so on...
"Alright! Everyone start!" I stare at Caleb as he comes over to my desk, grabbing another chair and sitting in it.
"Hey," Caleb said in his sexy voice. Yes, I just said sexy!
"Hey." Dammit! I tried to act cool around him, but it didn't work.. Dang.
"Do you want to come to my house after school to start on the project?"
"Ummm sure. Do you need a ride?"
"Yeah. I kinda rode the bus so yeah." He laughed. But I didn't.
"What do you want to know?"
"Do you have a boyfriend?" I just did not hear that coming out of his mouth.
"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Noooo."
"Oh ok." He said that excitingly. Ummm is he about to ask me out?
"What do you want to know about me?"
"Everything." Awwwwwwww.
