Greg had been in the picture for five months before he asked my mom to marry him. Of course she had to say yes. The giant sleeze ball that looked as bed as he smelt, was aother druggy that moved in and took all of my money. I had a job ( only because I begged the owner of the doughnut store to let me clean the place) and with my mystery fathers monthly child support payments, the two were able to get their fix faster and easier. It was a wonder we had a place to sleep at night with electricity and hot water.
"Hey. Where'd ya go?" Cam pokes my shoulder, taking me out of those horrible memories. He's the only one that I've aloud to touch me in so long. Not by my choice either. When my father had explained to his wife and sons what had happened to me, Cam had pushed his way in to my life, always making sure I was okay and never leaving me alone for more than two hours at a time. He was insistent and pushy and slowly started to give me hugs or show his love for me in small ways until I didn't cringe at his slight touch. I've known Cam for just under two weeks, but I feel like I've known him all my life.
"Just into my head. Thinking about the past. What people were so ignorant of." I rub my hands together then on the comforter, wiping off the sweat.
"I see." Is all he says. After a few minutes of silence, Cam reaches over and grabs my hand, giving it a small squeeze. "Go to sleep Hannah. And think about something nice, no more past memories."
I nod and close my eyes, thoughts of dancing and ice cream the centre of my dreams.
