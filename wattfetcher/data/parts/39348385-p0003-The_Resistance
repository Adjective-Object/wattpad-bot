Hunting season is the time of year where men and boys alike can get guns, knives, and traps and use them against the animals in the forest. Most get something out of it like a bear skin rug, stuffed dear head on their wall, or animal skins that they can sell for a lot of money. For the hunters, it is a proud time of their lives, but for the animals? ...............Not so much.
A bunny. Probably about 16 in human years, was running for her life. No matter where she went, she was followed by two large dogs and a hunter with a big red beard, glasses, and a shot gun. She ran over hills, in narrow spaces, and into tree hollows, but the dogs could always find her. The hunter fired the gun a few times. Every bullet that was fired got closer and closer to her. BAM! The fifteenth bullet. The bunny fell in a river as soon as the shot was fired. Little did she know, there was a large chunk of her ear missing. She climbed out of the river. Her ears were ringing. Did the loud sound of the gun firing a bullet possibly make her deaf? The moments that she spent being in the river gave the hunter and the dogs the chance to catch up. She only ran for about seven seconds before one of the dogs bit down on her damaged ear. She squirmed. The pain was too much for her. The hunter walked up to where she and the dogs were. He pulled out a sharp knife and roughly grabbed her left foot. The blade of the knife cut through the skin of the poor rabbit's foot. She squirmed and whined. It cut through the muscle. Then the bone. The blood dripped down from the blade. The hunter looked at the freshly cut off foot proudly. He put it in a small pouch and whistled to the dogs. The dog dropped the bleeding rabbit to the ground and followed the hunter and the other dog. The little rabbit used whatever strength she had to drag herself to a nearby hole. She fell in the hole. What happened later will be forever a mystery.
A family of ducks were sitting by a stream. The mother and father had four babies with them. It was hunting season but the stream was always safe because people had made it against the rules to hunt there. The family of ducks flew away from the stream to be somewhere else for no good reason. A hunter on the ground saw them and aimed his gun. When it was fired, it was expected to hit the father. That didn't happen. The bullet hit the youngest of the family. A small baby duck old enough to fly but still very young. The baby fell to the ground. The parents flew down to the ground to see the baby. The baby's entire right wing was now very bloody and almost gone. The hunter was nowhere in sight so the father picked the baby up with his bill and flew back to the stream.
A porcupine was just walking through the forest three weeks before hunting season started. Her plan was to get as much energy out during the three weeks before hunting season and then sleep in her home during hunting season. Her plan was fail proof but SOME HUNTERS didn't want to wait until hunting season to go hunting. A hunter saw the innocent little porcupine and decided to shoot her. One shot from the hunter's gun and the porcupine's ears were ringing. The bullet got 2/3 of the porcupine's ear was shot off and the ringing was a result of the loudness of the gun firing the bullet. The porcupine was slowly losing blood and  she didn't realize.
A deer was on the ground. She was sleeping. A hunter saw her body and thought she was dead. He wanted her head. He pulled out a knife and started to cut into the deer's neck. The deer started to squirm and the hunter jumped back. He dropped his knife. The deer ran for her life after that.
Three hunters were in a fight with a bear. The bear's mother was dead and skinned. This bear wanted revenge for his mother's death. He fought the hunters until only one was still alive. He lost a lot of blood and fur. The one hunter left standing ran until his legs were sore. The bear looked at his mother's dead body and then looked at his own. He knew he would die. He laid next to his mother's dead moving body and just closed his eyes hoping that he would be with his mother soon. That was not the case.

Well writing a prologue for all the characters is very boring. If you want me to do the rest of the characters, I will do it later. I just won't do it now.
