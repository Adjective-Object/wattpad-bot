The scene in front of us changed. I recognised the place, it was the second floor fireplace room.
A redheaded American chuckled to himself. "Heh. One down, nine more to go." Past Allen said.
"Yeah. Looks like it's actually second time's a charm, eh?" Past Matthieu smiled darkly.
Past Luciano walked out into the hall. "They all went upstairs. Tell the others to regroup here so we can finish off all of those First Players already." he ordered.
Moments later, all twelve Second Players were gathered in the hallway of the second floor...along with a certain (h/c) haired, (e/c)-eyed girl that had a frown prominent on her face.
"Oh, come on now, poppet...I'm sorry I didn't let you out sooner, but we just really had to do it..." Past Oliver apologised, hugging the girl.
Past (Name) tore away from the Brit's embrace and sighed. "No...you didn't really have to do it. I love you guys, but...this is just...wrong... You've...killed Italy...and you're off to kill the others, too? You've done more than enough damage..." she said, lips trembling a little.
"We're sorry, (Second Name)... After this is all over, we'll...send you back home." Past Luciano told her.
Looking away, Past (Name) spoke softly, "Can I...at least see Italy, even just for a few moments?"
"Fine. As long as I accompany you." Past Luciano said. The girl nodded slowly, and the two of them entered the room where Italy rested peacefully.

"Right...this is the second time loop. The time...Italy died." (Name) realised, looking down. "Well...the time he and...I died." she added.
"......Don't be so sure that you were the only one, ragazza." Luciano said softly.
Raising an eyebrow, (Name) gave him a confused look. "What do you mean? What happened...?"
"The worst happened."

The rest of the Second Players waited out in the hall while Past Luciano and Past(Name) were inside the room where the lifeless Italy was.
"Are we really gonna send the dollface back home after this? She's seems cool to hang out with." Past Allen said, toying with his nail-covered baseball bat.
Pouting, Flavio dusted his fabulous outfit. "As much as I'd hate to say it, but it's for the bella's best."
"Nooo. I don't want to part from our sweet poppet..." Past Oliver whined.
Suddenly, an incredibly large, alien-like creature appeared behind them.
Shrugging, Past Zao pointed at the creature. "Hey, Allen. Your friend here is back."
"Huh? Oh." Past Allen said, turning around. "Great job back there, Ste-"
Without warning, the monster used its powers to attack Past Allen. The American was shocked, but was able to move away. His shoulder started to bleed, though.
