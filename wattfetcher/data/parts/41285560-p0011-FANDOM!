So about 2 mins ago I was reading a fanfic on this wonderful app Wattpad which we are currently on.... and I'm not going to say which fanfic but yeah so things were getting AMAZING and I was to busy reading to focus on life and the little simple things they did I did and them it said he inhaled a deep breath naturally that's what I did so it saves my life..kinda.... naturally a reflex would have kicked in forcing me to breath but I'm just going to forget the last 20 words.
----above this line their is 95 words and now their is 107-------
