Erin's POV
about a week later I went to a park and I saw Jordan and he was walking over to me.
"Hi! what are you doing here." Jordan said before I shed a tear.
"Oh my god. what's wrong?" he asked.
"It's Nothing... I... no sorry." I said while wiping the tear off my cheek with my sleeve before shedding another.
"I'm fine, I just... like you." I whispered under my breath as quiet as possible.
"Your fine?" Jordan asked as HE wiped the second tear from MY face
"I'm... fine" and getting choked up and hiding my face but then...
Jordan's POV
I kissed HER. I kissed her, I kissed Erin. Erin I kissed.
"Are you sure you're okay?" I asked.
"Yeah, You kissed me. Why?" she asked.
"Because I wanted too." I said as I nervously smiled at her.
"Really? Jordan." She said in the cutest way possible
Erin's POV
He kissed me and I loved it.
"Oh, Jordan." I said with obvious love in the words
"Oh, me?" He asked in total sarcasm.
"You." I responded with a fake angry voice.
"I..." He started, there was a long long pause as we stared at each other the exact same way he stared at me at my house in the hallway.
"you're amazing." I said out loud, oops, oh my god. "What?" he asked. "What?" I responded "What, What? I'm amazing?" he asked. "I didn't mean it, I mean I meant it but not out loud." What the hell Erin? get yourself together please.
"Your beautiful." he said "oops I didn't mean that out loud at all." he said sarcastically "You, rude!" I said. without meaning. "And thank you." I said. "I..." he said again "I?" I asked before this time he shed a tear "Oh, Jordan." I said as this time I was wiping the tear from his face.
"Damn it, you got me crying again." I said.
"Why do you say that?" he asked.
"What - what do - what do I say?"
"OOH, Jordan." he said mimicking me as best as he could yet also with emphasis.
"Oh, Jor - I mean - " I said as he said
"No don't stop saying that, I... I love it."
"I need you... to help me with something I need to do with you now today. Jesus never mind!" Jordan said
"Or do you just need me?" I asked
Jordan's POV
"I love you." I muttered under my breath without her hearing.
We almost kissed but she got a phone call and denied it to kiss me but I turned away too soon and she kissed half my cheek half my ear.
"Oh god!" she exclaimed.
"I need you, Erin." I said with confidence.
