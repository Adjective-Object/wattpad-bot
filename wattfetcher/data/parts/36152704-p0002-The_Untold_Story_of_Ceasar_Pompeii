I remember my eyes widening at her words. Before I could speak, my father called down for Rosalyn. "Don't leave us waiting!" He shouted from below.
Rosalyn and I stood there in silence.
"I love you, Cesar. See you soon." She said softly, walking pass my frozen stature.
...
That was the last time I saw my sister.
I wish I could go back. Before I rejected the offer. I would have told myself to go. To not think, just go...
It would have been better that way. If I had left with Rosalyn, there's a chance that my mother would still be here on earth.
My name is Cesar. Cesar Pompeii, like the famous award winning film "Pompeii". I lived in Mantua, Italy till I was 16. Then moved to Pennsylvania... My mother is dead...
Little did you know, I killed her.
Here's my story.
