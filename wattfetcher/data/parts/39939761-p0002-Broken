"Angie are you serious?" I asked her and she simple nodded. "Here sing this" She commended. I saw it was a song my mom, German and I wrote together. "I can't do this why would you even ask me !!" I almost screamed. "How could you?" I continued. "Sing or leave" She said I got tears in my eyes. "it would rather leave then stay with someone like you" I said. I pulled the song out of her hands and walked out of class.
Lodo followed me. "Tini !!" She yelled. i turned around. "You need to return to class what was so bad, you could've just sang" She said and I handed her the song. She looked chocked. "How could she?" She said. "I don't want to be any longer with her in one room" I said.
"But you need to, She got an assignment if your not in class she'll choose with who you gonna sing" She said and I looked confused. "What's so bad about that?" I asked and she got ready. "Well Jorge kind of volunteered" She said and my eyes widened. "Are you serious? Well what the hack are we still doing here we need to get to class!!" I said and we ran to class.
