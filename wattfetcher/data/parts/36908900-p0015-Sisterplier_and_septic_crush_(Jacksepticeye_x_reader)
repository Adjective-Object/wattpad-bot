Y/n's POVI was irritated... I didnt know if I should believe Jack... should I believe he truly loves me? Or.. should I believe he just wants to get in my pants? As I was thinking I hear taps on my window I move some of the blinds so I was able to see.. and what I see is a nervous but cold Jack... he smiles... "Jack... what the fuck are you doing here?!" I whisper yell "I..came..to..profess..my..love..for..you..." he said shivering and his teeth chattering I open the window fully letting a breeze zoom through I then let Jack in and close the window before setting my blanket over him and I. "I-I really love you..." he smiles "I... Jack... Mark would be angry if.. if he saw you..." he frowned and looked down "Do you no longer have feelings for me?" He asks I grab his hand "I will always have feelings for you... its just I dont want you to get hurt for me" he looks me in the eyes "Its not only for you... its for us... our love!" He whisper yelled.. he stood up "I wish you can see I love you!... I love you Y/F/N!" (Your full name) he yelled I stood up covering his mouth "Shhhhhh" I said freaking out looking around.... "I-I see you love me... I love you too Jack dont think I dont.... its just... hard for me..." he chuckles "its not just hard for you... its hard for me too just to make you see... see what I see... think about it..." he said opening the window starting to crawl out of it... "Wait..." I say stopping him "hmmm..." he says turning around "i've thought about it and.... I'm sorry-"____A/nOHHHH SHIIIEEETTT..... its a cliff hanger....
