"Sorry its just not easy to hold back when I'm with you." He said breathlessly. He smiled and giggled lightly. "You're kinda irresistible." I felt a blush spread across my cheeks as I looked down and smiled.
"Look who's talking." I said. "You could probably get any girl in the world if you wanted to."
"The thing is... the only girl I want is you..." he said softly.
At that point, I didn't care I already knew I wanted to be with him and him only but now I know he feels the same way. I kissed him passionately as he hovered over me on the bed, being careful not to squish me. When I pulled off his shirt he rolled over and lay down next to me.
"I thought you said you wanted to go slow." He said in a surprised tone.
"Well I guess I changed my mind." I replied softly.
