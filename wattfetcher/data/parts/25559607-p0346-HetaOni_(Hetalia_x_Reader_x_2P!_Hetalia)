"There! We finally defeated it!" my blond older brother panted, clutching his gun tightly.



As we were about to run after the ragazza, three of those alien creatures appeared out of nowhere. Allen was supposed to have command over them, since they all used to listen to him...but it's not working anymore. I knew that there was something wrong with the other monsters in the first place. I know.



Unimaginable as it might sound, we managed to have that truce that we initially planned with those First Players. It wasn't for the reason we intended, though. I've had other reasons, but for now, we agreed because of the monsters that we had to battle and the ragazza we had to run after.



At the thought of her, my eyes darted towards...the lifeless body that was lying down on the floor, beside the cloth sack. I gingerly placed the body back inside the sack and sighed. "...I'm sorry."



"You do know that we need an explanation for that. And that we need to act on this fast. I don't want this 'truce' with those First Players to last more than it should." Kuro said, walking towards me.



I fixed the rope on the sack and tied it securely. Handing over the sack to him, I spoke, "I'll explain everything later. For now, we need to do what we need to do. Just hold on to...her for me." I told him. He paused for a moment, but followed my instruction anyway.



"E-Excuse me, I'll go after (Name) so that we can actually talk about what your real intentions were." that soft-spoken counterpart of Matthieu said, walking towards me.
