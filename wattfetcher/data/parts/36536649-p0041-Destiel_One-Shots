Dean was shocked Cas would even ask that. Castiel Novak, the with the name of an angel and the looks of one too, who Dean was in love with.
"Do you honestly think I don't?" Dean asked. The look on Cas' face said it all. "Oh my god, you don't. Cas," Dean began. "I love you more than anything else in this world. This world isn't big enough for how much I love you. The world is so stupid, it doesn't even have a word for how much I'm in love with you. Even you, which you probably swallowed a dictionary when you were five, don't know a word for it. Castiel Novak, I. Love. You," he finished.
They were both quiet for a long time.
"Dean, can we hold hands again?" Cas asked, finally breaking the silence.
"Oh, we can do more than that," Dean replied with a saucy wink, and he placed a kiss on Cas' lips. It was a sweet-tasting kiss, and it was soft and beautiful and perfect.
"Boys!" The librarian, Mrs. Harvelle, called. "Keep it in your pants!"
Cas blushed when Dean said "no promises" back.
