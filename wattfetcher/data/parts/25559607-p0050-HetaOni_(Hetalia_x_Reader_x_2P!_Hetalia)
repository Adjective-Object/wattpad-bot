A memory?
==========//////==============
Japan, America, and England were in front of the haunted mansion.
"Here! It's here! Just like the rumours said!" America exclaimed.
England cringed at the loud American's voice. "Hey, America, keep it down a little, will you?"
"I'm not doing anything wrong! Right, Japan?!" He turned to his Japanese friend.
(Yes, yes, that's right! It really was America and England who came here with me.)
(We said that, and then we came in...and then...) Japan thought.
Suddenly the scene changed.
It was now Japan and Prussia who were in front of the mansion.
"Is this it? Are West and Italy really in this place?" The albino asked.
Japan nodded. "Haa... Indeed."
Prussia looked at the other skeptically. "... You're thinking, 'This sucks,' aren't you?"
"I-I'm not!!" Japan denied.
(No, that's not it. The one who came here with me was... Prussia! We decided to come and pick Italy and Germany up, so...)
(... No.)
(This isn't it. This memory is wrong...)
The scene changed once more.
Now it was France, China and Japan.
The Frenchman gestured at the building. "So, this is the haunted mansion that America told us about?"
China nodded and grinned. "That's right! Let's hide before they get here and give them a fright!"
Japan sighed. "China... even if they didn't do the same to get back at you... and even if it weren't this mansion, you should be a little more reasonable..."
"It's now or never! You guys, get ready! He's coming this way with Italy!" China exclaimed.
"Pff...Wouldn't it be nicer if we just made something to eat together?" France suggested.
Japan agreed. "Definitely..."
(This one is wrong, too...No, maybe it isn't wrong, but...No, it's wrong. This isn't what happened.)
The scene changed again and this time, it was Japan, Russia, China, Prussia, Canada and France.
Japan inspected the mansion's front door. "It clearly looks like something is about to come out of it, though..."
"That's true~ Are they really in this place?" Russia asked with a childish smile.
Prussia looked at the tall man and spoke, "You go ahead and get in, Russia. Me and Japan are just gonna chill here and wait for you."
Russia pouted. "Aww, you're so mean! Come on, if the three of us go, I'm sure we can give the others a scare!"
"Erm, aren't you forgetting someone?" Canada asked softly.
Japan looked at his friends. "Prussia, Russia, please feel free to go ahead. Canada and I will be waiting here while we have some tea."
(And then Germany got quite a scare...But Germany came with England and? No, this is wrong, too. This isn't me...)
