***LOST RUSSIA, FRANCE, CHINA***

((Third floor room -- Italy, America, England, Canada -- America, Canada, and England's death))

"Yeah, we'll be fine, so just get out of here and get us reinforcements or something." America said, patting my back.

I turned to him and spoke, "Wait! In the meantime, even you will get hurt beyond help?"

America shook his head, "It's fine. Besides, I want to do these two a favour and stay with them."

"America..." My gaze trailed over to England and Canada's bodies laid on the bed, bloody and bruised. I waited for a few moments to see if their chests would rise and fall...but it didn't. They weren't moving at all.

The American turned to follow my gaze and froze for a moment. America clenched his fists and breathed deeply, "...Haaa

... No, that isn't it. They can't hear me any more, so I'll tell you in all honesty...


I want to stay with them. Til my last moment.

Because they're both very important to me."

"And because you're going to... protect me?" I asked softly, guilt stabbing me violently.

America didn't look fazed at all. He even gave his signature grin and gave me a thumbs up. "Haha! Yeah. Even though I can't even move any more. But I'm not making a mistake. And I regret nothing."

My eyes widened at his statement.

The American staggered a bit as he walked over to the bedside, and caressed both England and Canada's heads. I saw his eyes started to water, but he turned to me and spoke softly, "Go for it. I wish you luck."

***LOST AMERICA, ENGLAND AND CANADA***

((Basement room with Prussia, Germany, Italy - Prussia and Germany's death))

"We got back the key." Prussia told me as he was leaning on the wall for support from the fatigue and the wounds he tried to endure.

Tears started streaming down my cheeks. "Hey, stop crying.We risked our lives and went through so much trouble to get it back. You should be happier." Germany told me softly.

"Why did you lie...? You said you were only going to take a look around..." I choked out.
