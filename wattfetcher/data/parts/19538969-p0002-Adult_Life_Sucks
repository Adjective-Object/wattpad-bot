"Hanging With Friends!"
The night Jake proposed I put down the phone and went to bed.The next morning I went out for breakfast because I was to lazy to make it myself.I went to a cafe with a grin on my face,then I ran into Jaellin and she was wearing a nice spring coat with a purple t-shirt and blue jeans with high heel boots,she was also going to have breakfast so we went to Marvin's caf√©.We started talking and asking about one another, like what's been happening in the last week.After I told Jaellin everything,we just went back to my house and watched a horror movie.We both love horror.When it was time for her to go,I started talking to Mya on the phone, and she sounded really upset.When I asked her what was wrong she said,"Im getting kicked out of my apartment and I have NOWHERE to go!!!!!"So I told her that "I have an empty room in my house ,and that she could live with me."I felt really bad for her.The room was supposed to be for Jake but she NEEDS it.I said I'll pick her up in an hour.I had to call Jake and tell him that its not really a big deal.He wanted to know what happened,so I said that Mya is losing her apartment and she has NOWHERE to go!Then I hung up and left to pickup Mya.She was wearing a shirt that said I'm with creepy and black pants with DC shoes.She was all packed and ready to go when I got there.She finally got in the car and we listened to music.When we got back to my place ,we got all her stuff in her new room.We got there and watched horror movies all night long ,eating ice cream.It was a great night!The next day we just had a nice and easy day.We went to see Georgia...for the whole day.Mya and Georgia haven't talked in a while.(2 years).They just had to get closer again.They don't know a lot about each other,because Georgia is always working at "The Museum of Modern Art".I work at the same place,on the same job.I see her everyday.They used to be best friends in school,but they didn't stay in touch.
