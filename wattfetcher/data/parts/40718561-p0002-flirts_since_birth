I woke up to the sound of my alarm. I brushed my teeth and then got dressed in mint green shorts with a white crop top and same color as my shorts suspender .and then white converse. I put a little make up since today isn't a big day .I put my hair up in a bun and added a white bow . As I walked down the stairs the smell of pancakes and bacon hit me .It smelled delicious. Michelle was a very good cook .I sat down and had a conversation With Michelle about her trying to show me how to cook. I'm already good just need to learn to make BIG meals.While I was talking to Michelle I felt someone behind me I almost slapped Austin from how scared I was. GOD I Cant handle this I've had a crush on Austin ever since we were baby's.are moms were supper close so we would hang out ALOT . He once kissed me but it was cause it was my birthday and he didn't know what to get me.But back to the story." Alex said if you want to go with us to go play basketball at 3:00" said Austin ,sure I replied I was bored so I decided to go out to the mall I was struting Dow. The stairs when I stopped how could I be so stupid I just remembered that I don't have a car so I had to have Austin take me I knocked and told him if he could drivee and he said.sure so we are at the mall and we hear a bunch of mahomies coming I was so scared but then Austin had the security come and help so that was a bummer since we couldn't even buy anything but I forgot about it after a game with Austin and Alex it was very fun and we continued to play it was getting late so I decided to go home alreadyÂ  met the love of my life (the bed) and drifted of to sleep
