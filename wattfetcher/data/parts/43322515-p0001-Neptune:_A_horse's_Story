When I was just a newborn I was born on a farm along with three colts. I was the only filly of the day. All of the colts and I were half siblings for we had the same father. My mother and father were both Mustangs which make me also a Mustang.
After five years on the farm I was trained and sold. I was passed from one farm to another for competitions and also farm work. People looked forward to me for I was one of the best horses around.
They would never allow me to have a foal of my own becaue it weakened a horse. They wanted me to have all the strength I need. I was never treated poorly and I had only one desire. To have a family of my own.
After turning twenty human years, my last owner decided I need a break. Since I am a mustang and mustangs are born to be free, he took me to Nevada where I could be free.
I have been running with a herd in Nevada for two years now and eleven months ago and a week I was pregnated by our lead stallion.
I am now laying in a field about to give birth to my very first foal with the herd grazing around me.
