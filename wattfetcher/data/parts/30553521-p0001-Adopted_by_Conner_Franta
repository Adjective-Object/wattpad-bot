Emalie's POV :
I did not have a great childhood lemme just say that. My father ran out on me, my mom was hit by a car. I was imedeatley sent to an orphanage. At three years old. Normal kids don't have to remember when they were three, but I can't forget it. Mrs. Patsy's home for orphans is where I've lived since I was 3. When I was 8 I was adopted. They abused me until they got caught.
I.
Was.
Sent.
Back.
Then I was adopted again at 10. They were shot. So now I am still at the orphanage.
I awaken crying from the same torturous dream from before. I get up and tried sneaking out, which i always do. "Where do you think you are going ???'' I turned around. ''Cleaning.'' I said. "Come on you know the drill." Which I did. She grabbed me and set me in the bathroom. "Get in" she said. I did. Cold water greeted me and ran down my back and sent chills through my arm. She made me stay in for 10 whole minutes. I was used to it, that is her way of punishing us. Then she ran warmer water and held me under until I passed out. I woke up in my room. I got dressed in a mint green sweatshirt and some shorts. I put on a headband and my hair in a bun. My hair was dark brown and my eyes were blueish hazelish. I was very tan. I was pretty average-looking.
