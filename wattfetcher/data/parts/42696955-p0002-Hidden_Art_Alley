Guys don't need muscles to get girls, at least me. I'll take him for who he is.
"He is annoying but lovable at the same time," I turn around and see myself in the mirror, "you don't love him personally but how he can act when he doesn't come to your door at-" this time a knock comes from the wall.
"Belle," William hisses through the wall, "be quiet.." I let out a loud sigh and slug off to bed.
Stupid.
I look at how much time is left on the video and then start to charge it. I can't wait to see the comments on that one, going to be very interesting.

The sound of my snoring wakes me up, jolting awake I look around me. Everything still in place, that's good. I lean over my bed and see my video was posted. Yaaay!
Another knock on my door, what the heck is this? Better not be William again.. I peek through my peep hole and see the mailman. Opening the door, he hands me a package with a letter. I thank him then I eagerly open it. It's from YouTube! Ekkkk!
"This is to inform Belle or BeautifulDinosaurBelle that she has reached 200,000 subscribers and we would like to show a plack to her great reward. Thanks again, keep doing awesome videos! YouTube. Oh this is so awesome!" I hold the plack up and smile widely.
I did it! I hit 200,000!
"See this suckers! For all those who doubted me let them know that I will not be defeated so easily! Dinosaurs will return to earth and I am going to be the first one!"
Okay the whole first dinosaur thing is kind of a joke, so don't take that seriously, please.
Dinosaurs are real.
They are my followers. My little dinosaurs. No! I don't like My Little Pony, the little just made the title seem more efficient. If you follow me.
I lay down on my bed holding what I got. I'm so happy right now.
