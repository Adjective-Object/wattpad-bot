This girl and I have been through so much together it would blow your mind I love her to death!!!!!. I met my bestie Angilee here on wattpad I think I was the first one to text her and then we started talking but then she kept getting lost so we started all over again with the introducing and suff lol and then we were talking and I got to really like her she is so nice and stuff so I asked her to be my best friend!!!!! And she said yes and then we got super duper close to the point where If I don't get to talk to her I feel bored or sick and I easily get jealous with her because she's such a great bestie and losing her would be the worst thing ever!!! . We haven't met yet I'm in Jamaica and she's in the USA which sucks because it hurt when that person that means so much to you is miles away!!!! . I hope we get to meet each other one day and do all the things that we dreamt about like sleepovers shopping together etc . My Angel has told me more I love you'sÂ  than my mom!!!!! She's just so adorable and beautiful she's my everything . I love her forever and always :) :* .
