Lachlan's POV
I hate moving to new schools. I only have to because my mom got a new boyfriend and has to move over to his house. I never really liked him anyways but I try to act like I care to make my mom feel better. After all she is still my mother. I just hate it. everyone always makes fun of me for being to tall and the way I act.I finish packing all my belonings and load the car. "Hurry sweety." That's my mom. "Almost done just need a little more to pack then I will be ready." I shouted back.
At least I'm not moving out of australia. (That would be a pain in the butt) my mom parked in her boyfriends drive way and we unload the car. "Hey Lachlan, how's it going?" Jerry (my moms new boyfriend) asks. "Not much." I say trying to act normal. "That's cool." He says. (Really cool, is that all your going to say, wow.... Just wow) "Well I better finish unpacking and head off to bed, I have school to go to, so yeah." I say sounding and feeling a bit awkward.
I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. I just hope I can make some friends tomorrow (I say thinking to myself). Then I start to doze off into sleep.
