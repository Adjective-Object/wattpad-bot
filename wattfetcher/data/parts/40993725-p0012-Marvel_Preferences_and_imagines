All of the sudden, his hand slips down to my lower hip.     "My lady, what is this?" Thor asked with a look of confusion. I look to see his warm hand tracing the tattoo of a burning heart on my hip.

"We should get matching tattoos," I added quickly, hoping he would be open to it. He nodded suprisingly and kept tracing the flames of the heart.

"Awww, you guys are so cute it's disgusting!" She says before gagging. I laugh, and just relax knowing that ive had the best birthday ever.
