Yeah so I'm gonna swear a little.
Don't like swearing?
#sorrynotsorry
Okay anyway on the note of badasses
I went to sleep at 4am like a badass XD
Yeah I'm pretty lame but... It's fun
On the note of the titanic:
WHY THE FUDGE DIDNT THE GIRL-WHOSE-NAME-I-FORGOT MOVE OVER AND LET THE BOY ON?!
I SWEAR SOCIETY SCARES ME
EVEN I NOTICED THAT MOVING WOULD HAVE HELPED
AND I WASNT PAYING ATTENTION
LIKE,"Gurl look STOP BEING A LAZY BUTT AND MOVE!"
It would have been a win-win situation because;
1) the boy would have friggin LIVED
2) They would have been warmer because of there body tempatures!!!
But NOO the girl had to be a jerk and be like,"Oh sorry I'm gonna be a lazy ass and not move so you could die of Hypothermia slowly."
#whodoesthat?!
Yeah I just had to complain about it XD
