"So are you," Castiel blurted, saving himself from the little slip of words with a stammer of, "Ready to go?" He swallowed hard, smiling weakly as he regained some of his confidence. "Are you ready to go?"
"Yeah," Dean nodded, and glanced around before setting the flowers on the living room table. "I told everybody to meet us out in front of the gym."
"E-Everybody?" Cas questioned, cocking his head and looking up to Dean in confusion.
"Uh, yeah, I invited a bunch of friends to come with us." Dean nodded, as if it was no big deal, as if Cas hadn't been stressing over this homecoming night for months. The blue eyed boy felt a stab into his chest, and swore the air was knocked out of him for a moment or two. He stared at Dean unblinkingly as his mind caught up to the rest of the world, processing his devastation and throwing it away before Dean would notice. "I figured it'd be all fun if we went as a group, y'know?"
"Yeah." Cas agreed, and forced a smile as Dean walked him back to the car.
