i smile i laugh none of it is real nothing but a rough draft
i want to be donereturn to my past state leave this emptiness on a silver slate
when i was alonelost in thought i never worried i liked when they all forgot
i was invisible i was freeno one could dampen my daybut me
now it's different ive given them the power i spiral out of control each day grows fouler
they can get me im under attack ive provided the gun and i can be ruined just like that
how trusting has left me dying
