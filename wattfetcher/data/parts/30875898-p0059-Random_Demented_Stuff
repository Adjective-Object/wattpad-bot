Secrets in the shadows
Not seen by any eye
Hiding away for days and days
So they can lay and cry
Secrets in the shadows
Blocked by a bullet proof wall
Locked away for days and days
Just to be let out and jump and fall
Secrets in the shadows
They stay away from everyone
Ripped away for days and days
The sun moves
The shadow drops
The secrets revealed
And these people are done
