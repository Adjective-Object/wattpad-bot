So far in life I seen several types of people. We have the nicest people in the world which bad stuffs strikes them like snow in Antarctica.
Then we have the nothing but bad people who nothing bad ever happens to them which are usually fake ass bitches.
Now I'm not saying take ass bitches are just girls there guy one as well but I call thoughts fake ass mitches. Good one I know. But I mean dealing with multiple fake ass people right now its two 'friends' and some one I called family.
Now I'm not gonna go in detail with the family one but I will with the friend one see my problem is don't be a shit talker and for you people don't know who or what a shit talker its someone who talks all this shit but when they get confronted its like 'oh no I never said that' or 'she's just making things up'. That's what I can deal with or two face-ness that's a whole mother rant. But just fake ass bitches got me thinking I'm the fake one like what the actual fuck is this shit. Still got me hung up shout out the real bitches.
