(dean's pov)I yawned as I attempted to sit up. I was stopped by a weight on my chest.I looked down and smiled, seeing my beautiful husband, castiel. as usual he was awake."good morning, dean" he greeted in his gruff voice. I wrapped my arms around him and he snuggled into me."mornin' cas" we lay like that for a few minutes before someone knocked on the bedroom door."s'open" Megan walked in.she was still in her pj's.Megan is cas and I's daughter. She's biologicaly cas' kid but I love her as if she were my own.she's 20 right now, so not sure if that still counts as being a kid. She has short blue-black hair, blue eyes -just like cas'- covered by glasses."dad,uncle sam says yous have to come get breakfast ""ok thanks, sweetpea." she nodded and walked away. Me and cas got up and dressed. We walked into the kitchen and saw sam cooking and Megan talking with jade.jade is sam and lucifers kid. Lucifer is her real father, but jade's mom was human, making jade a half angel. She's 19,has long-ish, black hair and green eyes. She's short too which is kinda funny considering sams height. Lucifer was also there talking to sam. They got together after lucifer and Michael's 'arguement'. I've gotten used to him being here by this point. "what's for breakfast?" "pancakes, jade and Megans request""sweet!" we all sat down and ate.  I loved when things were like this.it almost seemed normal. Obviously our family could never be normal but you know what I mean. I knew it couldn't always be like this and that broke me inside. I hate that my daughter and niece couldn't have normal lives. If I could wish for one thing, it'd be that the two of them could have the 'white picket fence life' Sammy always wanted.
