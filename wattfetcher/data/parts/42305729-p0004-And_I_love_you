Hey friend, this week I feel a little strange with my feelings for you.

I still love you, i think so.
I don't know, sometimes I feel like I don't care about you but suddenly my heart start beating again for you.

And I don't know what else to say, I'm confuse.
I need to think about it, give me time.
