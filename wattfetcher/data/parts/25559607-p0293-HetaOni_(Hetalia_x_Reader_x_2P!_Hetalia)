"You're falling apart, Germany...I think that was the first time I saw Prussia get so mad at you." Italy pointed out.

Germany covered his face. "...Ugh, shut up. I'm so pathetic...I wish a hole would open and swallow me up."


"Pff! You, Germany?!" Italy chuckled a bit.
All of a sudden, they heard another voice from down the hall. "Italy?"



"Oh...!" Italy jumped when he turned around to see Past Germany walking towards him.


Germany raised an eyebrow and whispered, "Idiot! What do you think you're doing?! You're overreacting!"

Italy turned to his left and faced Germany with an alarmed expression. "B-but, Germany, you--"

"Italy...you were there all along...I knew you were alive..." Past Germany slowly told him.

Italy took a step back and said, "Oh...er...I-I'm sorry!" Then, he runs down the right hall quickly and entered the top room. "H-hey! Don't go-Wait!" Germany called out, following Italy into the room.

"Nooo! Germany saw me!" Italy panicked.

Germany placed a hand on Italy's shoulder. "C-calm down! Why did you even come here, anyway? Our house isn't even finished yet!"

"I knooow! But my feet just brought me here! What are we going to do?! What are we going to do?! We have to hide!" Italy said frantically.

Germany sighed. Â "Fine! Let's just hide behind that curtain! Hide yourself!"

Italy nodded and pushed Germany towards the curtain. "I see! Right! Then you go there, Germany! I'll hide somewhere else-"

"That's impossible! There's nowhere else to hide-Look, let's just hide there together!" Germany suggested.

Italy shook his head. "We can't!! There's barely enough room for you! We won't both fit in there!"

"B-but-"

"Just do it! It'll be worse if there's another Germany! Go, go!!" Italy told him, pushing him behind the curtain. "Hey, stop pushing me!" Germany said as he got concealed behind the curtain.

After that, Italy walked to the centre of the room to think about how he was solve this dilemma of his. Before he could even think of something, Past Germany entered the room, behind him.
