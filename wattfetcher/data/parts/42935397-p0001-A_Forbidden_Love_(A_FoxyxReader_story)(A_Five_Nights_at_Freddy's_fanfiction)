Bonnie's P.O.V
The twitching. The screams. The blood. The little boy. The flesh. The looks of concern. Foxy. It wasn't his fault, I know that. It's a shame no one else believes it wasn't his fault. I saw Foxy look over to me with the look of guilt in his eyes, I couldn't help him. This day was going to haunt him forever. This day in 1987.
Freddy, Chica and myself exchanged terrified looks before rushing off the Show Stage and scurried over to the Cove. It was horrible sight. Children were crying and screaming, parents were rushing their little ones out to their cars and employees were contacting ambulances and police officers. Blood stained the wood on the pirate ship stage and the purple starred curtains.
All of the sudden, paramedics bursted through the doors. They rushed into the Cove, set the little boy on a stretcher and ran him off to the ambulance. The manager of our franchise shooed everybody out of the pizzeria. He then bolted to his office and came back with a 'Sorry! Out of Order!' sign and placed it against the wall.
I felt bad for Foxy. He really didn't mean it...
