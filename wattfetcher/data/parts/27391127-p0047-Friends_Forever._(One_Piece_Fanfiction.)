Haruka: Shit, we're in some serious troble.
Sakura: Yeah, I know. Musn't let the PFU know.

Aya: Know what?
Haruka: Nothing you fluffy piece of shit!

Aya: *cries* Law, Haruka being mean.
Law: *smirks* I wonder why?

Sakura: You *points at Law* Shut the fuck up!
Aya: *slaps Sakura*

Robin: You're in serious trouble because..
Sakura: Robin, Shut your damn trap before you spoil the rest of the arc that's already fucking ending!

Aya: *slaps Sakura multiple times*
Haruka: Damn, usually I'm the one who gets slaps. Oh well.

Aya: Hold on *reads chapter* That's three slaps.
Haruka: *Why does Life hate me so?

Aya: But don't worry. I won't hit you! ^_^/
Haruka: Yes. Suck that  fucking dick, bitchy lizard.

Aya: I'm calling Lucy!
Haruka: 0.0 wut?

*Random crossover from Fairy Tail*

Lucy: Heya Aya!
Aya: Hi Lucy!
Haruka: What the fuck? That is against the anime rule of justice. How can Lucy from Fairy Tail appear in a One Piece Fanfiction!

Aya: The rule didn't say anything about crossovers. beside, Saki-chan uses  alot of references form Fairy Tail.
Sakura: *who was drinking tea with Robin and Law* What?

Aya: Admit it! Even your own devil fruit is a reference from Fairy Tail!
Lucy: What the hell is going on?

Haruka: No fucking idea.
Aya: Oh yeah, back to the point.

Lucy and Haruka: Think about these things sooner!
Aya: Lu-chan, can you give Haruka *counts on her fingers* eight kicks.

*Everyone blinks*

Sakura: Damn that's alot of kicks.
Law: He'll be totally deformed by the time she's done.
