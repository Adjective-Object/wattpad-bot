"You know Michael Clifford right?" The casting director asked, while guiding me through several doors.
"The name rings a bell." I mumble, racking my brain for a face or a distinct style or character. The lady laughed, pushing open a final set of double doors. The set unfolded around us, brightly lit. A hospital scene was under way, everything in the set seemed contrasted the main actor. He wore all black against the plain white walls, even the patient he was visiting contrasted him although they both had pale skin.
"That's Michael Clifford." She whispered, she didn't even need to point, you could tell it was him just by the way he handled himself in front of the camera.
As if he heard the subtle whisper from across the room, his dull green eyes flickered up to meet mine. The previously sad expression lit up instantly, his character shattering to reveal the real Michael Clifford.
The director yelled cut right after, slightly confused in the break in acting.
"Is this the coffee guy?" Michael asked once he was a few feet away from us, he eyed me.
The casting director that I hadn't learned the name of laughs, the sound coming out like melodic bells. "You know very well that there is no coffee guy, stop being silly and introduce yourself."
The light-hearted scolding made me pay more attention, I began seeing small similarities between the two.
"Can you get me coffee then?" He asks, completely disregarding his mother's instructions.
"Of course." With that, she disappeared though the double doors, leaving me behind.
"And who are you?" Michael asks, eyeing me once again.
"I'll be playing your friend, Josh Hall."
"No no, I mean what's your name?" He said rolling his eyes, but the small smile gave his amusement away.
"Calum Hood." Luckily he ignored the way my name came out in a questioning manner, like I wasn't too sure that I am.
"Well Calum Hood, welcome to Hollywood!"
A/N: What is this?! A new story? I'm excited.
