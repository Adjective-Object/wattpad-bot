The rest of the day was pretty much a blur until my last class of the day history with Riley's dad. I took a seat too bad Lucas would be hear too. Suddenly Riley swung into the seat right next to me. "Maya why have you been ignoring Lucas all day?" Oh great I had to tell Riley all about my feelings for Lucas here goes nothing. "Because I like him and I'm gonna ask him on a date after school". "Why is there war?" Mr. Mathews started his history lesson.
