I shrugged, "Dude I told you- it's fine."
"I shouldn't have said that. It was uncalled for." He said not even looking at me.
I sat down beside him, "Seriously its fine. What are you looking at?"
"Pictures."
"Of what?"
"Sound check."
"Oh, can I see?" I asked him looking over his shoulder.
"Sure." He said moving a little so I could see better, "I like this one."
"Yeah I do too, I look fucking hot."
He laughed, "Sure you do."
"Damn I look good." I muttered, "Do I always look that hot?"
"And this one of you too. I think this is my favorite of the ones today so far." He said changing to another picture and completely ignoring my question.
"Oh that one looks awesome too."
He smiled, "Thanks."
"No problem." I said returning his smile. He kept scrolling along through pictures and talking every so often about them. I don't think either of a realized how close we were sitting to each other, but I didn't mind it.
"Sorry if I'm boring you with camera talk." He said finally looking up with only a few inches between our faces.
"It's fine," I told him smiling. "All of it is actually pretty interesting."
"Uh, really? My ex always thought it was, uh, boring and meaningless."
"Well I'm not your ex am I?"
"No, you're not."
"Exactly and I think this is all really cool."
"You think this is cool? Like you're not lying are you?"
I shook my head and made the move of rest my hand carefully on his thigh, I wanted to see how far I could get, "I'm not lying. This is really cool stuff."
He blushed, "Really?"
I nodded leaning in a little more brushing my lips against his.
He jerked his head back moved away, "Uh, no, no." He said shaking his head and getting up, "Just no."
"What?" I asked, "What's wrong?"
"That. Whatever that was. Its just no."
"Okay, I'm sorry." I said standing up.
"Its fine. Just I-I don't want to start something or do anything. I'm here for school and business, not a new relationship or something." He said.
"Who said anything about relationships or starting something?"
"No one did." He said quickly, "Just that, almost kiss thing. It can't happen again."
"It won't don't worry."
He sighed and smiled at me, "Good, good."
"Now are you going to finish showing me pictures or are you going to keep freaking out?" I asked sitting back down.
"Pictures." He nodded sitting back down leaving much more space between us then I hoped for but he set ground and I was going to respect that.
For now at least.
Another half hour and the guys were back and shouting at me because we were meant to be in the venue but Alan and I got caught up looking at picture of sound check, a few from other nights and even some he's done before he came with us. We all walked into the venue just as Pierce the Veil was going on.
