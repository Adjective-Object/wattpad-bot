The worst part about being homeless is the season changes. Especially autumn and winter. And unfortunately, it's almost that time of the year again.
Once in a while, I'll get a generous person who will give me five dollars or less to get something. Or someone will give me food that they don't want. It's nice and all, but sometimes I wish they would give me a home.
I don't regret running away one bit. It was hell for me. I just wish I would've had a plan instead of living on the streets.
I've been walking for hours now, trying to look for the guy who saved me a few days ago. I know, I know. I live in New York City so what are the chances of seeing him again. Very slim, but I have nothing better to do.
"Hey!" Someone shouted from behind me. I turned around. A guy with blonde hair waved at me and I rolled my eyes. I just kept walking. A few seconds later, I felt a hand on my shoulder.
"Hi, I have this extra coffee from Starbucks because they gave me another one by accident. I thought you might want it? It's getting really cold out, ya know," the Irish sounding boy smiled at me and held out the coffee for me to take.
"Really?" I asked and he nodded. I took the cup and a sip. It's warmth filled every part of my body. I closed my eyes enjoying every single second of it. I then said, "Thanks."
"No problem. My friend was the one to point you out. I'm not sure where he went though?" He started looking around us and shrugged his shoulders.
"Just curious, what does he look like?" I smiled.
"Oh, he has cur-" his phone rang cutting him off. Dammit. He answered it, "Okay Harry, I'm coming. Sorry."
And he hung up, "I'm sorry, I have to go. My friend is waiting for me."
"Wait! What's your name?" I stopped him in his tracks.
"Niall. Niall Horan," he smiled before running off in the other direction. I grinned even though he couldn't see me. I wish people were always this nice. Usually they give me food and run off, but Niall started a conversation with me. Hopefully, I'll see his face more often.
I just wish I knew who his friend was.

I walked into the old, abandoned hotel building. There was cobwebs almost everywhere you turned and the walls were starting to cave in, but it was so much warmer than sleeping outside. I climbed the flight of stairs to the top floor so I could get a view of the city.
Everyone seemed so happy. Families walked around. Friends laughed. Couples held hands. Tourists took pictures. I smiled wishing I could've had success.
"I got you something," Niall's voice startled me from behind. He's been bringing me food and drinks for the past week now. He always says how it's his friend who makes him do it. Yet, I never get to see him.
"Damn Niall, you scared me," I grabbed the paper bag from his hand, "How the hell did you find me up here?"
"Harry told me you were," he shrugged.
"Will I ever get to meet Harry?" I sighed, taking a bite of the blueberry muffin in my hands.
"Probably not,"
"Why?"
"Not sure, I guess he just doesn't want you seeing him. He's not the kind of guy to be nice or give to other people," Niall chuckled.
"Of course," I rolled my eyes.
Niall ignored my gesture and checked his phone. Sometimes I wish I had one, "He texted me. I have to go. See you tomorrow?"
"Okay," I simply said. And he walked off. It bugs me that this Harry guy doesn't want me to see him. I'm sure he doesn't look that bad. Though, Niall did say that he's not the type to be nice to other people.
I laid down in the once used, squeaky bed. My dreams were filled of the mysterious boy.
