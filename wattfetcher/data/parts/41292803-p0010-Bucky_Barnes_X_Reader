I agree.

Bucky pulled all the covers off of our beds and then grabbed some pillows. In the middle of the room, he made a pile of blankets. We didn't have much but at least it was something. He lay down on one side and set my pillow on the other. I grinned and lay down. I touched his metal arm.

Why don't I scare you? He asked.

Because your not scary.

But I kill people. I am, Hydra's greatest weapon.

You are also my greatest friend.

I sat up, grinned down at him, and then smacked him with my pillow. His face was so funny. He grabbed his pillow and hit me back. We ran around the room, hitting each other and laughing. I ran and jumped on my bed. He grinned up at me. I then did something unexpected. I jumped on him. We both went down. We rolled around on the floor until I stopped on top of him. We looked into each others faces. He was happy. His hand snaked up and gently touched my face. I smiled as he did it. I grabbed his hand and held my hand up to his. His hand was huge compared to mine. I grinned. Then, the door opened.
