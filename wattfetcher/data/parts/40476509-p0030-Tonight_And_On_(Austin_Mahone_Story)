**3 hours past 6:23pm**
We were hanging out for a while. I had fun hanging with the crew. But I don't think Amanda did. She really didn't talk and didn't even laugh or smile not once. I told everyone that they could spend the night since its late. Amanda feel asleep on me, then once we were gonna go to sleep I had to carry her upstairs. I laid her on the bed and covered her with the blanket. I got in bed and laid next to her. I wrapped my arms around her waist and didn't let go.
