I ran my fingers through my hair as I colored in the A. Next question... I bit my lip and glanced to the person next to me.
"Pst. Dan. Dan. Daniella. Number 14."
"C," she whispered back.
Number 15... Haven't picked B in a while... I colored in the B and then signed my name at the top. I flipped the page and slid it to the front of my desk when I noticed there was blood. I looked at my hand and I had gotten a paper cut.
"Don't die." Daniella giggled as she looked back at her quiz.
I smirked and raised my hand.
"Ms.Joplin," spoke Mr.Grore.
"Nurse," I replied. And with a nod I went out the door.

I arrived and opened the door. There was about a 2 kid wait, I figured might as well just wait being I had nothing else to do.

The nurse looked at the sign in sheet and called me up.
"Hello, Erica. What's the problem?"
"Just a little paper cut." I smiled, as she handed me the bandage.
I washed my hands and put it on.
"Thank you," I called to her as I walked out.
I turned to make sure the door shut, but kept walking.
BUMP!
"I'm so sorry!" I went on my knees and began picking up the fallen books. "Here."
The girl gave me a smile and nodded and she pushed her glasses up and continued walking.
I looked at her as she walked away and then continued back to my class.
BUMP!
"Oh, I'm sorry! Second time today." I giggled.
I reached my hand up handing the person the book.
I climbed back onto my feet and turned to face him.
"I-I-I'm sorry." I quickly said and turned to continue walking.
"Wait," he said as he grabbed my arm. "I never got your name."
"Erica. Erica Joplin."
"I'm Tommy. Tommy Zista."
I smiled and pulled a pen from my pocket.
"Hand." I said as he stuck it out. I wrote my number, clicked my pen, smiled and walked away.
**"I clicked my pen, smiled and walked away."
"Eek! And he's an older boy!!!" Squealed Daniella.
I scooped up the last of my soup and ate it.
"Crackers." Daniella said as she put her hand out to me.
I grinned and unwillingly gave them to her. I mean come on, they're the best part.
"You're just lucky I can't eat them!" I scolded.
"Lucky? Ha! I gain 10 pounds a year from these things."
"Really?"
"Really."
I laughed.
"I'm not kidding!" Daniella protested.
