"Who's making out with me?" Kellin asked walking in.
"No one."
"Vic is."
"No, no I'm not."
Kellin turned to me, "Why are they talking about us making out?"
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"Vic, Mike and Tony both just told you to make out with me. Now what are they talking about?" He asked his cheeks slightly red.
I looked at the others and glared at them, "When we got wasted, we made out and now they're just giving me shit for it."
"We made out!?"
I sighed, "Yes."
"Now you two need to do it again." Tony said and I glared at him.
"Tony shut up."
"Why should I?"
"Because I told you to. Now shut up!" I said and turned to Kellin, "Yes we made out but it was just a drunken mistake and nothing more."
"Right, a mistake." He said, "I have to, uh do some school thing."  He said and ran back to the bunks.
"Way to go asshole." Mike said glaring at me, "You made the poor kid cry."
"I didn't make him cry."
"Yeah you did." Jaime said walking out of the bunks, "You need to pull your head out of your ass and realize you like him." He told me taking a seat beside me.
"But I don't like him."
"Yes you do." They all three said.
I groaned, "Can we stop talking about this?"
"Not until you admit that you like him."
"Well I don't." I said stubbornly.
"Vic, we've all seen you check him out and the way you look at him not to mention you're like ten times nicer to him than you are to everyone else." Mike said turning off the T.V.
"Fine, fine I like him but it's too soon for anything to start."'
"Why? Because of Cara? It's been over a month and she was a bitch who cheated on you! Move on Vic she's far from worth it." Jaime said exasperated.
"You guys don't understand that I really loved her. Yes she was a cheating bitch but I was with her for a while, but it's not just her either. All my relationships end terribly and honestly I just want a break from them right now. I want to be single right now." I said, "Can't you guys get that? I like him, yeah, but I need a break."
"So you do like him!"
"That's not the point Mike." I said scowling, "I want to just be single for a while and not deal with all of the drama that comes with being in a relationship."
"Fine, fine but you like him!"
"Yes oh my god! I like Kellin Quinn! Do I need to announce it to the world or something?"
"I think you do."
"Well I'm not going to." I said crossing my arms and slumping in my seat.
"We'll give you time." Jaime said, "I mean not too much time, but we'll give you time."
"Thank you, and I will tell you when I'm ready." I said smugly.
"Well then you're never going to get with him." Mike said, "We'll give you space for the next... two weeks but then you better fucking make your move."
