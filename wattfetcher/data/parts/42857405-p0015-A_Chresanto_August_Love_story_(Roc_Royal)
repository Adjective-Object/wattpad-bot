Roc- Wow, you okay
Me- Yea I just feel like I need to get away from all this for a while
Roc- Let's take a trip then, to malibu
Me- What! Malibu?
Roc- Yea, we can find a way to just getaway and have time for ourselves
Me- Um I guess but what about the money
Roc- Leave that to me, just get your passport and luggage ready by next week, on Monday we'll leave
Me- idk we got school and everything
Roc- we will just tell that we're going on a trip with our family
Me- Okay, Omg roc I'm so excited!
Roc- Me too
He kissed me softly and kissed my belly. I think we're ready to start a family and if not we'll find a away. Roc dropped me home and he went home. I went to my room and took a shower. I got in bed and was thinking about the conversation me and Roc had today. OMG I can't wait! I couldn't even sleep.
So this chapter was short but i will try to make the next chapter longerr. Will the trip to Malibu be a big mistake? Will everything be just as they wanted it to be? Find out
