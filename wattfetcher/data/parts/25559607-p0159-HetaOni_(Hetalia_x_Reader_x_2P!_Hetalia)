"If only I had... got here sooner..." Past China said, looking away.
Past America shook his head. "No, I'm the one who made us split up!
......That---What's that book in your hand?" he asked as he saw his brother holding some sort of book.
"Oh, this? I found it in the library room. Er, actually, it seems to be a... journal..." Past Canada explained.

"America! (Name)! That book...!!

Do you think that's the journal?!" Japan pointed out. I could only give him a weak smile, but didn't say anything.
Past America gazed at the journal. "That's the book that Italy had been using...isn't it? I thought it was a Bible, though...Is that it?"
Past Russia opened the book and nodded. "Yeah. And there's something...strange about it. It's on the first page... Here! Look at the name here."
"Italy... Veneziano..." Past England read aloud. He continued,"It doesn't mean it's the name of the journal's owner. It kind of looks like this is a...contract sign page.
It says..."
Suddenly, America disappeared from my side, meaning he's being pulled back to the present. I almost tripped because I was leaning on him earlier.
"I feel like I'm going to be pulled back.... No---I have to stay just a little longer--even if it's just for a few seconds!!" I heard Japan cry out, but he disappeared after.
I tried to reach out to him but was too late, "Japan!!"
Slowly, I felt myself being pulled back to the present, as well. But then, as I was supposed to give one last look at the event in front of me...

.......something caught my eye.
The door to the fireplace room was slightly open.

And I saw it...
.......I saw a pair of magenta coloured orbs peeking behind the door.

I was about to approach the room, but in a blink of an eye, I got sent back to the present.

~~~Japan's PoV~~~

"Japan! America! (Name)!" I heard Russia call after us.
I shivered a bit upon realising I was back to the present.
America scratched his head. "We're... back? Oh...If only we could have stayed a little longer..." he said in a disappointed tone.
".....Yes....if only we could've stayed...even just a little while longer than that...."

(Name)-chan whispered.
Canada gave us a look of worry. "Just sit down, please.You three look very pale."
"..... It was actually... the second world..." I said out loud.

England tilted his head. "Hm? What's the matter?"
