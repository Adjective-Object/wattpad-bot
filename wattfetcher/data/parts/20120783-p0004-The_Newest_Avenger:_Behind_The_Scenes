That day was probably the best day of my life. I got my first ever professional acting job, got the part I've always wanted, and I got to meet Robert Downey Jr.
When my mom and I finally got home, I told only my dad and my brother about the part I got. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else besides my family or else news would spread like wildfire. I told them that I was going to be in the next Avengers movie! My character was named Summer Stark and was Tony Stark's and Pepper Pott's daughter. I couldn't wait to be a part of the Avengers!

A week later, my script arrived in the mail. I started reading it right away and didn't stop until I finished it. The story was amazing and I was so happy to be a part of it.

Joss skyped me and talked to me about the read through, training, practices, and filming days. The read through would be in a week and in New York. I had never been to New York before, but I had always wanted to go. I would have to do training and practices for fighting and combat next month before we started on our 3 month shoot. From that moment on, I knew I was going to have the best year.
