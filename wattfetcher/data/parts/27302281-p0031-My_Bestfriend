Get out my head
I am your head Justin
I ignored  the last one and went in the house by now it was almost  dark  we have been here for a while
" kylie  I got a meeting with my boss on a house we are building so I gonna go. Do you wanna stay here or I can take you home " I said waiting for her answer
" actually I'm kinda tired so I  think I'll head home " she said
We said our good byes and got in my car  and I dropped her off at her place then  drove to Selena's and parked in her drive way and walked up to her house and I  got the key from under the mat and putting  in the lock and unlocking the door then putting the key back and turned the door knob and stepped in
Justin don't do this what about kylie
im doing this to protect her

Justin don't act like you dont love her
don't start
Then why did you comfort her during the storm
Because I can
" hey  " I said climbing  on the  couch
" hey sexy " she said smiling
Her smiles nothing compared to Kylie's beautiful smile
See told you  that you love her
I start making out with Selena and then I push her away
" selena I can't do this i  shouldn't have came " I said running out the house
Can't believe you
I know I cheated but Kylie's a better kisser selena sucks at kissing
Then selena  started messing with her phone
Kylie POV
I was laying in bed  when my phone went off
