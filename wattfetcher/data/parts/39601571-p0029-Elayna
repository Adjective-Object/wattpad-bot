I said I would give an explanation so here it is. â€¢_â€¢

Okay so last night my parents got in a big fight.( that's why I had to leave aliensarereal001 )
It got pretty ugly. So I just wasn't having it.I was up super late and was just mentally and physically exhausted.
So the next day ( or today whatever) I was on the verge of tears all day.
My mom came and got me earlier cuz I was so tired and super depressed.( mom doesn't know I'm super depressed right now)
So that's a big part I guess.
But there's always more stuff and of course it's online. :(
As many of you know I'm being cyber-bullied. ðŸ˜•
I've been cyber-bullied many times so I'm use to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt.
So I have to deal with that :/
Then I'm being bullied in school ðŸ˜‘
But that's been happening for all my years of school so not that affective.
But with everything coming down on me at once and other stuff, that I'd rather not put on the Internet, it's a lot for a someone my age to handle.
So once again, I'm ignoring all text.
If you want to talk to me the best way to try is WattPad but I'll be ignoring some people :/
Nothing personal just I don't want to talk to specific people.
