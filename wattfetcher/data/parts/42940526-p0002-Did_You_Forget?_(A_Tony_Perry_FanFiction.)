"Hey, after warped what's next?" Mike asked as he held his son.
"Hmm, not sure. I think we're doing the Latin American tour, but Chris isn't sure." Chris is our tour manager, he basically books our shows.
"Hey where ever it is, we're still going to be with each other." Jaime said, we all smiled and looked at each other. This band has been around for eight  years? Pierce The Veil or not, we all are going to be best friends.

"Bye Tony, thanks for coming man." Mike said before bro hugging me.
"No problem, see you later." I said.
After saying bye to everyone, I stepped out the house and already heading to my car.
"Tony!" I turned around to see Violet behind me. I smiled and turned my body to her. "You're leaving now?" She asked.
"Yeah, I'm pretty tired." I said.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened to the party turtle?" Violet asked, as is she were surprised. I chuckled.
"Well, I'm old."
"Got that right." We both laughed. Violet always had a sense of humor. "Friends?" Violet asked, sticking her hand out for me to shake it.
"Friends." I said, before taking her hand a shaking it. A few seconds later I squeezed it, causing her to jump.
"Tony you jerk!" She laughed before pulling her hand away.
"Hey, friend!" I teased. Violet smiled and nodded. "That's not way to take to a friend!"
"That's why we're best friends!" Violet said in a smart ass tone. I laughed and nodded. "Well you should be getting home."
"Yeah, see you later?" I asked.
"Later." she said before hugging me, I hugged her little figure. We exchanged numbers and went our separate ways. I looked back to see her opening the door. I smiled and kept on heading back to my car.
Driving to my house, I remembered the memories Violet and I shared. I'll never forget them. Hopefully Violet and I will rebuilt our relationship, it doesn't matter what we are. A couple, or friends, I just want Violet back into my life again.
