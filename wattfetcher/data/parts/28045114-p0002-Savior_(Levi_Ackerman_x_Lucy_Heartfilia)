"Do you want me to get them?" She asked giving me a concerned look. I nodded and stood up.
"Tell them to meet me in the park." I told her and walked away.
As I was walking down the street to get to the park I spotted the monster that seemed very familiar....
"N...no..." I quickly began to run and scream at the people to leave. "EVERYONE LEAVE NOW!!" I shouted and everyone started running away. "what the hell..." I whispered as it grabbed me and picked it up. I was about to attack when it disappeared into nothing! As I was falling I immediately summoned my wings. "SPACE DRAGON'S WINGS!" My wings appeared. I slowly Wendy down and noticed Natsu, Gray, Erza, Wendy, Gajeel, Levy, Mira and Cana running towards me.
"LUCE ARE YOU OKAY!?" Natsu shouted, I was shocked... I finally had the damned chance to KILL the monsters that took away my childhood happiness and I LET IT GO!? What kind of human am I!? A few tears welled up in my eye and my lip trembled.
"Lucy was that the one?" Mira asked with a sympathetic look in her eyes,  I nodded and closed my eyes.
"I... I.... I need to be alone..." I stuttered in between sobs and ran away.
'I failed you mama... papa...'
