Max POV
I got up at 7:00 on Monday ready to run away. I packed my things, got my money, booked our plane tickets and got my black hoodie on to cover my short, bright red hair.
Dris POV
I waited outside for Max. I was ready. I had written the note to our parents, and packed my things.
Max POV
Dris was outside waiting for me and ready to go."Got the plane tickets?" She asked me. "Yep." I answered tiredly, readjusting my bag. We were going to Manchester for two weeks and then to a final destination, Edinburgh.And when we felt it was time, we wanted to go to the United States.
Dris POV
"I feel like I'm going to burst with suspense." I said with an excited look on my face. We crept down the hallway, and I put the note in our parents room. "We're free!" I whisper/shouted as we walled out the door.
Max POV
"What time is our flight to Manchester?" Dris asked me."9:00." I answered, checking my purple watch.
Dris POV
"Shoot! We need to go now!" I exclaimed as we quietly went out the door. I hailed a Taxi and we started towards the airport." How much longer?" Max groaned. I smiled slightly, and shook my head causing my golden hair to fall out if my hoodie." We will be at the airport soon."
Max POV
We finally arrived at the airport, when we got stuck at customs.
Dris POV
" Oh my gosh!" I almost shouted and I pulled my hood up closer to my face. "Don't move." I whispered to Max. A man in a black suit walked by. When he was gone I let out a big sigh. "Who's that?" Max asked with a confused expression on her face. "That was one of Fathers bodyguards."
Max POV
I though to my self for a second. "Wouldn't that mean Father is here?"
Dris POV
I snorted but a sad look came into my eyes. "He won't be home for a month. And in 2 days its going to be my birthday." "He doesn't care enough to come home for my sweet 16. I don't think that he'll be here."
Max POV
I nodded. Father would miss Dris' sweet 16 and my sixteenth birthday in 9 months. Mother wasn't much different, too in to her beauty and not our well being.
Dris POV
"Flight 603 to Manchester" I heard over the speakers. "That's our flight!" I said excitedly. " Out future awaaaaaits!" I said in a sing-song voice as I grabbed Max's hand and we headed towards the plane.
Max POV
The line was long to the plane even though we had booked first class tickets. When we finally got to the desk, the lady noticed how young we were. "How old are you two?" The grumpy lady asked. Dris started before I could. "I'm 19, and I'm traveling with my sister. She's 15." She said politely. The lady eyed her suspiciously and then scanned the ticket. "Have a nice flight!" She said slightly rudely.
Dris POV"You too!" I said in an high pitched annoying voice. The lady shot me a death glare and we boarded the plane. Max giggled a little bit and I have her a grin. "You're insane!" She said in betweenlaughter. "I'm just awesome!" I replied back, laughing slightly.
Max POV
The flight was quite uneventful other than talking to the sassy flight attendant. I read some Harry Potter and drew a little bit. For fifteen, I am quite childish. I draw crazy pictures (though much better than a 5 year old) and annoy my big sister.
