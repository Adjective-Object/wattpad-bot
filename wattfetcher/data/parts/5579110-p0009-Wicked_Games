"Shit." I muttered.

Nia's P.O.V
It was the muttered curse that woke me. I blinked and shifted.
"Marcus...? What's wrong?"
"Nothing. Go back to sleep..."
I didn't think nothing of it as I laid back down on a hard pillow. Then I shifted again to get back comfortable and raised back up.
He must have put me on top of him to squeeze both of us on this narrow couch. His heart raced under my hand and I pushed some of my sleepyness aside.
I realized that he was very aroused and that our bodies touched intimately in the right places. I looked into glowing eyes. I felt every inch of him and couldn't help getting very aroused myself.
Instinctively, I shifted, sliding my pelvis against him. Marcus groaned and I gasped as I felt him get even harder.
Skip if necessary look for the *!!!!*
His hand grabbed my butt as I rocked against him, not able to control myself. He stopped me and I gave him a sleepy murmur of disappointment but I quieted when he crushed his lips to mine.
I rocked again and pulled back to concentrate on feeling the friction between my legs. I began throbbing and I grinded on him. He helped me pushing himself harder against me. It felt so good......
I came, whispering his name. He started to throb against me and I knew he was close as he pushed himself against me faster.
"Don't stop." I moaned. We came together. Then as he began shifting us, we fell off the couch. His body cushioned the fall plus we didn't have to far to go. When I looked into his eyes the glow had dimmed.
*!!!*
"We should stop..." He said, raising up. I climbed off him feeling strangely embarrassed, standing in front of him naked. I ran from the room into his bedroom without replying.
I jumped into the bed and climbed under the bed spread. He didn't follow but I expected him to come so I waited. After a long time, I gave up and begun to drift off. Then as I was half sleep, I felt him get beside me and wrap himself around me. Then I slept.
