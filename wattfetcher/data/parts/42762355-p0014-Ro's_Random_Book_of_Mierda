So at six I woke up to leave to my godmother/cousin's place in Kerimäki. It's always so nice to be here, even with the new family around... We already went swimming, visited my uncle, ate lunch and took a nap. Yes, I was bored, so I closed my eyes and yeah... Even if I didn't actually fall asleep it was nice to rest for a while.
It's 02:30 now and we're waiting for my cousin Väinö to wake up. Apparently we're going to the beach again. I'm sitting on the couch, listening to my cousins talking with their neighbour about what kind of asshats the Southern bitches are... And I'm drinking light coke from a pink cup. Cute as fahk.
I think he woke up now. The door of the kids' bedroom opened... I'll catch him--
//after getting huggled by a toddler for five minutes straight//
Well then... The Finn in me has softened again. Goddamnit Väinö...
I find it amusing how different the people of Kerimäki are from us... It must be that the whole municipality is flippin suburb.
And now I'm being dragged to the playground by my cousin Satu... I think I want to stay on the couch and eat pretzels...
