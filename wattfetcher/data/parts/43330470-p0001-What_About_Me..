Why don't things ever come out perfect? A life for instance, the reason this question is bothering me today is simple. My life sucks! I know what you may be thinking, well everyone says that they're life sucks. Well you obviously haven't met me. This is the story of my totally sucky life.
*********************September 5th 2014 *******
Today I start my new life in New York, that's  right New freakin York! I must be so lucky right? Wrong! My new school is nothing like my old one. My old school was full of people tring to be the next Beyoncé, that will end up not being more that busboy at Mc Donalds. Seriously, I went to a public school full of people who had been to jail at least once. ( me included but more about that later)
My new school is one of those big schools that all the rich kids go to, to waste time until they're parents let them have they're jobs. Well I far from rich, I don't even no how I ended up in this school in the first place. I guess they made an exception, or something.
Anyway I'll  tell you a little about myself. My name is Leah Corman. I'm 15 years old, my favourite colour is dark brown. I have naturally bleach blonde hair, and brownish-goldish eyes, I have a Dad and a two younger siblings, jack and Annie, and they are twins. I have no friends considering I just moved here 3 days ago. My mom ran way to god-knows-where after the twins were born. And my life kinda sucks.
" Lee, breakfast is ready, and hurry up or your going to be late for your first day of school," my dad yells from downstairs.
" I'll be down in a sec," I answer throwing on some new clothes.
I go into the bathroom to bush my teeth, and fix my hair. I figure I should probably at least look like I belong there. I put on some makeup to try and cover up the bags under my eyes, and the red blotches from me crying myself to sleep for the 7th night in a row.
I run down the stairs and into the kitchen, grabbing my bagel, and kissing Annie and Jack on the foreheads. Leaving the babysitter in charge of them, I go outside and climb into my dads truck, buckling in.
"Morning sweetie," my dad says pulling out of the driveway.
"Moring," I reply shoving my bagel in my mouth and then tying up my shoes.
"Excited for your first day?"
Momentarily incapable of speech, I give him a thumbs up symbol, causing him to laugh.
We pull up minutes later into the driveway of Thompson high. I already know that this is going to be a hard first day. all around the courtyard are people that look like they came out of a magazine. wearing clothes that costa almost as much as a college tuition. I step out of the car, say goodbye to my dad and head into the main office.
When I get inside, the office lady gives me my schedule. She says there is a student with all the same classes as me. she turns around and calls a name I cant quite catch to the office.
" You needed to see me Ms. Ammels?" a voice says from behind me.
" Yes Justin, Leah here is a new student, and she has all the same classes as you. could you please show her around for the first week or so?"
"  Sure," Justin replies.
It was then that I turned around.
The guy standing behind me was absolutely gorgeous. He had sun bleached brown hair and sparkling green eyes. He looked like he had been an athlete his whole life. I could just see the outline of a six-pack through him tight blue t-shirt.
" Are you ready to go?" he asks.
It takes me a moment, but I finally answer,
"Yeah," It comes out almost as a whisper.
He starts to turn around and I follow him through a couple of hallways until we get to a classroom.
And that is where my horror begins.
