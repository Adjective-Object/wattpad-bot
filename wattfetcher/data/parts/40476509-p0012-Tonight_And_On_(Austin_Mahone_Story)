I constantly gave Zach an evil glare cause he was constantly starring at Amanda like if she was a piece of candy. I understand that she looks like a piece of candy but she's mine and only mine. Then all of a sudden Amanda interrupted me out of my thoughts. "Hey I'm gonna go in deeper, do you want to come?" She asked.
"Nah I think I'll stay here a little bit longer" I replied. She replied with a simple "ok" and walked into the water then she swam the rest of the way in. I was watching her and I was watching Zach. He was still constantly starring at her and it's starting to really piss me the FUCK off!!!! I'm gonna make him stop one way or another.
