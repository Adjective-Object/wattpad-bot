"Hey, kid, how was school?" Emma asked as her son walked into the apartment.

"Good, I guess. Oh, we got a new history teacher. He's from Ireland and he's got this really cool accent," Henry says, accepting the hot chocolate his mother handed him.

"Is that so?"

"Yeah. Mr. Jones. He seems to really like teaching history. And around his room there are posters of pirates and such from the past. It's pretty cool, actually."

"Well, I suppose I'll see it when I go and meet him on Friday," Emma said, walking into the living-room part of the apartment and starting to fold the basket of clothes.

"Again? Didn't we just have a parent-teacher meeting?" Henry asked.

"Of course. Two months ago. You know they come every month. Though we missed the last one," Emma said.

Before she knew it, Friday had come, and Emma found herself walking through the hallways of Henry's school. She had just visited all of the teachers but one, and that was her son's history teacher. The last teacher wasn't always showing up for the parent teacher conferences, so Emma never really knew where the history room was. However, before long, she had found it, just as a man and a woman walked out. She then went in and closed the door behind her.

"Ah, hello there," a voice says from behind her. With an accent. That's new. Emma turned on her heel to greet him, but was suddenly struck silent when she did.

The man sitting behind the dark, wooden desk had dark black hair and eyebrows, making his sparkling blue eyes stand out, and he had a lovely smile on his face. However, the man's expression soon changed, as he frowned slightly, raised an eyebrow, and cocked his head to the side.

"Are you all right, lass?" he asked. Emma shook her head slightly.

"I'm fine. Sorry," she said as she approached him. He stood and extended a hand, and she shook it.

"I'm Killian Jones, the new history teacher," he says with that oh-so lovely accent.

"I'm.. Emma Swan. Henry's mother," Emma said as she pulled her hand away and they both took a seat.

"Ah, Henry. He's a great lad. An absolute pleasure to have in class. He isn't afraid to question something or even state his own opinion about it. You've done a great job in raising him," Killian said with a smile. Emma nodded.

"Thank you. I try my best with him. He says he enjoys history class, and even told me that he really enjoys the way you teach things, as opposed to the last teacher, Mr. Gold."

"Aye... Not too many were fond of how he did things. He was rather strict and someone that I myself didn't truly get along with in any way. But I'm just glad the students are getting more out of things now. At least, I'm hoping they are," Killian said with a chuckle. Emma smiled.
