well I had a very exiting day:) first I actually slept in till 7:00am (I usually wake up at 6:00am)yay *throws party* lol kay back on topic at 10:00am we left for the mountains for a little picnic. if u don't know why this is exiting, the creak we were at, my mom went there when she was a kid and it brings back memories of her childhood. it was an early mothers day present 'cuz it was a free day and a late birthday present even though my moms birthday was on April 25th but still!!!! its the mountains. and funny story(srry for the lack of capitals I will maybe edit these soon) back to the story, we were free ranging meaning we were not in the campground and in the wilderness, and there was horse fly's bugging us and it annoyed us so we went to the campground where there was very little fly's, and it was around 10:30 at night ,and we had steak and potato's 'cuz we can and we had steak and potato's for our lunch. our picnic reminded me of spot 17 , where we were. it just bring back memories and I had a fun time there not on the way or back 'cuz its a 2 hour drive and thank god I had music!!!! well I will stop bothering you with my memories, this is Angel and I will see you all laterÂ  byeee:)
