"Ace!"
"Ace-sama!" Haruka called, fainting from a nosebleed in the entrance of the shop.
"Don't get a freaking nosebleed and collapse in the front of the bloody entrance, you shitty demon!" Sakura yelled at Haruka.
"WHAT'D YA CALL ME!"
"The two of you - SHUT THE HELL UP!!!" Aya shouted bonking the two. Some of the customers were now afraid.
"Don't worry, Master-sama. I took care of the nuisance. Ploof~"
"I'm ready to accept any punishment, Master~"
"Of course Aya-chwan! Sakura-chwan!" The regular  male customers called out.
"Why are y'all working isn't this restaurant own by Do-"
"Don't finish that thought." Aya commanded softly gesturing to the monitor Den Den Mushi that stood on the corner of the room. Haruka immediately understood but reluctantly made Aya lead him to Table 4.
Sakura, on the other hand, attended to her new customer.
"Good Morning Master~" Sakura greeed.
"No need for formalities but good morning."
"Ace-sama is so polite." Haruka fantasied.
"Order something already." Aya stated harshly.
"What would you like, Master?" Sakura asked Ace.
"I'm not in the mood for food now." Ace said.
"Well, what's wrong?" Sakura asked on her knees with a pout. Ace laughed at this.
"Well, Oyaji gave me a difficult task and I didn't finish it on time so I had to do paperwork and I've been doing this since nine." Ace related sadly.
"That's too bad. A game would cheer you up!"
"No thanks. Just came to visit."
"But, can you stay for a while please? It gets awfully lonely around here." Sakura said cutely looking away.
"I will stay here and eat all your delicious desert!" Ace exclaimed.
"No way, I ain't going through hell thrice." Sanji exclaimed from the kitchen.
"As long as Ace-sama is here, I will stay!"
"Order something already." Aya reprimanded.
"Coffee and the house special." Haruka answered.
"500,000,000 belli."
"No way. I bet that house special isn't worth more than Luffy!"
"It is!" Luffy exclaimed from somewhere.
"At least, if we bring these too in, we can pay for it." Nami joked to Robin pointing at Ace and Luffy.
"No fucking way!" Ace and Luffy shouted.
The day continued on as any normal day, you know, Luffy eating 'til Roger come, Zoro being Zoro and Ace being Ace and falling asleep and male customers fawning over the maids. Chopper had left because he was called in for an emergency and Usopp went to get someone but apparently never returned.
Then the big shots decided to come in. In a manner of say, teasing that particular maid, the owner put a list and which Tables they would be serving. Hence the reason why there was a line in front the cafe as male customers wanted to be served by a particular maid. As mentioned afore, the big shots which include Kidd, Law, and Crocodile.
