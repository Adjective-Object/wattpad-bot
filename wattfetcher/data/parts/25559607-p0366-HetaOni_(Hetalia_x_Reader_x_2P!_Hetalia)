"Reaally now? Show me your hands then." I instructed her.


She shook her head forcefully. "Don't wanna."


"Oh c'mon, (Name). If you got cut, then we should treat it." I said, opening my bag. I couldn't bring myself to leave the room without it, and good thing I did bring it because I found a small med kit inside. That was convenient. "Hold out your hand." I said.


"B-But! ...Will it hurt?" she asked nervously. I shook my head. "Naah. Okay, just a little, but you're a strong girl, aye?"


"Aye, captain!" she giggled, saluting me with her left hand.


Rolling my eyes and chuckling, I spoke, "You salute with your right hand, silly."


"Nu-uh. This is my way. That's how it'll be!" she said, sticking out her tongue.


Shaking my head, I smiled and gave in. "Fine. Now, show me your hand."


She did as she was told. As I treated her hand, she winced a little, but didn't complain. When she was finished, I made her face me and grinned. "See? Wasn't so bad, right."


"Y-Yeah.." she said sniffing a little. I turned to look inside my bag and scavenged for something. I saw that there were mostly clothes, but there was food inside it as well.

Then, I found a (favourite candy) and held it up to the little girl. "Here you go. A reward for behaving."


"Oooh!! That's my favourite!" she squealed in delight, taking the sweet in her right hand. "Thanks, (Second Name)!"


"You're welcome. Now, are we still going down?" I asked. She nodded. "Alright, I'll go first, then I could just catch you when I'm down. Okay?"


"Okay." she said, munching on the candy I gave her.


Tying the rope on securely on a metal bar near the door, I dropped the other end below. I climbed down and gave a sigh of relief when my feet finally set on the floor. "(Name), it's alright now. Just jump, I'll catch you." I told her.


"Okie dokie!~" she said, leaping down. "Woah. Seems like someone wasn't supposed  to eat sweets, after all." I joked, noticing the girl bursting with energy.
