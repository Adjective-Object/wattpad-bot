Haruka was shocked before turning around and passing his hand through his hair.

"Well, we better start looking for those outfits."

"In robes, no way Hose."

"Fine we'll go change but don't take forever."

"Yay!"

"Haruka-senpai, don't look." Twilight warned.

"Why the hell should I watch?" Haruka complained before turning around. Its hard for boys to realize (especially Sanji) that when girls say don't look, they mean don't even shift.

Anyways...(^_^)/

Long story short, Haruka accidentally turned because according to him, he heard a 'buzz' and turned around and unfortunately seeing Millie-chan. The boy blushed 600 shades of red before Aya and Sakura knocked the living lights out of him.

"This is the royal dressing room. Feel free to try on as many dresses as
possible." Twilight mentioned showing them the huge walk-in closet called a 'small' dressing room.

"So cool! I've never seen this many clothes." Sakura awed with sparkles.

"You must have more clothes than Barbie." Aya noted.

"It's not like it matters." Haruka muttered looking for appropriate clothes.
After a while, everyone finally had outfits.

Aya's one was a white barrel dress which ended 2 inches below her knees. That night, she planned to wear her hair in a high ponytail.

Sakura wore a turquoise dress with black sleeves. She planned to wear her hair in an elegant bun with pearls and a single turquoise streak.

Haruka, on the other hand decided to wear a black suit with a green dress shirt (the first two buttons undone). He didn't have any special plans but asked not to be seen knowing that he will be there.

Twilight understood..partially.

"Haruka-senpai," Twilight asked approaching him after the girls left,"Why don't you want to be seen?"

"Because..." Haruka started. As he explained, Twilight was shocked and almost cried. She understood everything now.

"How did you know?" Haruka asked.

"It was the way you looked at me."
