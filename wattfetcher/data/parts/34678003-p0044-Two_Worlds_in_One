Once in the infield and Chase's mom, dad and I were at Chase's pit box down on pit road. I stood on the wall with Chase's pit crew as they watched the restart. Leader chose the inside so that's were Chase was in row two. "Annnnnndd GREEN GREEN GREEN!" I still had my Sprint Fan Vision on and tuned to Chase's scanner so I heard Chase's spotter over the radio. "Outside, outside, Kasey Kahne is in P2, dive bomb it in the bottom of turn three and you can pass him." There was a pause then I heard his spotter again, "Down, down!! Good aannnnnd clear! Great job. P2 with one lap to go." A pause then, "you're closing in to Erik Jones. Do the same dive bomb in turn two to Jones and you can get this thing." And oh geez was I on the edge of the wall hoping this would all play out well. "Alright, that's okay" I heard his spotter say - the dive bomb didn't work. I knew Chase wasn't going to give up. "Inside, INSIDE! Erik is getting lose - CLEAR! Great job man! Pull away and..." Chase crossed the start/finish line and won!! His whole pit crew jumped the wall and went to hug each other and celebrate. "Yes! Thanks guys!" I could hear the smile in Chase's voice. "Great work!"
