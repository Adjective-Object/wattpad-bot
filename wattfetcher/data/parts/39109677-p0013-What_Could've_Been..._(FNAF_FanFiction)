I put down my phone and went downstairs to wait.
After about ten minutes a gold Honda V6 pulled up in my driveway. So Goldie drives a sports car...
I watched as they walked up the driveway, staring in awe at my houses the entire time. I went to the door and opened it, still in the clothes I was wearing at school.
"This is your house?!" Goldie asked me in shock. I nodded.
"And you live alone in here?!" Freddy inquired, I nodded again. "Wait...Could we sleep over?" he asked. I mulled it over, two boys in my house at night...HMMMM...But then again, no one could tell me no!
I nodded. "Sweet!" both the twins exclaimed.
Oh boy...what did I just sign up for?
