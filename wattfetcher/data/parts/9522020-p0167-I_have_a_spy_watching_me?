"She was taken in the middle of the restaurant."  Mom said.
"What happened after that?"  Mr. Shane asked me.
"I-I was," I gasped in pain and whimpered after Lane touched my leg.
"Sorry Jaycie."  Lane said while wincing.
I just shut my eyes and nodded slowly for Mr. Shane to slowly move his hand with my head.  I grunt in pain though.  My head is hurting so badly.  Black spots are slowly making their way into my vision.  I guess Mr. Shane notices that as well.
"Jaycie, stay with us!  We are almost there."  He said.
Although I did try, my eyes were very heavy.  I tried to stay awake, but my eyes drooped.  I slowly fell asleep, but before I could I heard my mom crying and my dad trying to keep me awake.
"Jaycie!  Jaycie!  Please, stay awake!"  Mom cried out.
"Jaycie, every thing will be okay!  I promise!  You'll be okay soon!  Just stay with us!"  Dad yelled out his own tears showing as he grabbed my hand my mom let go of.
"I la-la-la...  I love ya-ya-you Mommy and Daddy."  I sputtered out then I succumbed to the darkness.
