i moan at the sound of the alarm clock. i try to stop it , with my hand of course , but it wouldn't budge
I got up my comfortable bed and groan. I touch the snooze button.
"smh stupid alarm clock" I roll my eyes at it . i stare at it with my angry eyes . "I'm going to kill you next time you wake me up , understand you ugly evil creature?" I point at him . am I really going to argue with a alarm clock? I check the time - 6:10 . school starts at 6:48 "a day at hell..." I mutter under my breath clearly referring to school
today is my first day of school , so I'm not used to waking up so early.
i must introduce myself, my name is Jennifer Ann Mcallister . i hate when people call me Jennifer so please don't call me that , call me Jenn . im a sweet nice teenager that is about to go to Cenntinial High School.

time: 6:18
I took a warm 7 minute shower .
I finished putting on my clothes I put a black long sleeved sweater , and some skinny jeans with some combat boots . simple . no makeup . and just a ugly normal ponytail. oh and of course my glasses. I mean it's school not prom.
I hear a loud annoying scream and I instantly know who it is . MOM
" BREAKFAST IS READY YOU BETTER HURRY AND GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE OR NO BREAKFAST!!! YOU DONT WANT TO MISS SCHOOL HONEY!!" my moms really strict but in reality she doesn't care about my grades . I always get F's and she doesn't care...
I walk up to the kitchen to see 3 pancakes stacked and 2 pieces of bacon . with Orange Juice "cmon jennifer eat it . you don't want to be late for school!" she screams looking at me eating . watching as I was getting the fork and putting the pancake in my mouth . It was getting uncomfortable she was watching step by step.
"stop staring at me? I can't eat because of you. so if I'm late to class I'll blame it on you." the words slip out of my mouth a little harshly .
"excuse me young lady? don't ever talk back to your mom like that understand?" she looks at me shocked about the words I slipped . her mouth was now wide open with her arms crossed. I was shocked too. I would never talk back to anyone . I really am not mean at all. but I guess today isn't my day? idk..
I nod slowly with my eyes still wide open
