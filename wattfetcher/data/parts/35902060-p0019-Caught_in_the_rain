Tessa's POV:
We go out to the garage where there's chairs. "When did this start?!" Hannah scream as I sit down. "Um, it's our 1 month anniversary in 2 days." Liam said sitting down next to me. "You remembered? " I ask as I ignore the chaos around me. "Yeah, that's when I realized I was a dumbass player and needed to stop fooling around with the girl of my dreams." He says taking my hand. "Daaaayummm son. You got skills." Autumn says sitting on the lawn mower. Hannah looks at her disappointingly and turns her attention back to us. "Why did you guys get together!?" Jasper says. "No offense." He says quickly as I laugh. "Well, because we love each other." I say as Autumn coos about it. "How did you know about this mister ?!" Hannah says pointing at Oliver. "Yknow that text that Tessa got in the fernal. That was from Liam." He said hands up. "Well, now that's done I'm going to go." I say getting up. "Oh no missy, we are going to talk about this." Kayla said as the pizza man came.
"Got to go." I say leaving. "That'll be $30.42." The guy said giving me the pizzas. "Here ya go." I said giving him 10$ tip. I mean he did drive all the way out here. "Are you a library book, because I'm checking you out." He says trying to flirt with me. "Um...." I say blushing. Liam must know something was wrong so he came over. "There something wrong babe." He said snaking his arm around my hip. "Is he your boyfriend? " the pizza guy asked walking forward abit. "Yeah, I am." He said. "Well, baby.I have a math test tomorrow." He said as I looked at his name tag. Nick. "And what does that mean?" I ask raising an eyebrow. "We can cheat on both of them.Call me. I put my number on the receipt." He says leaving. "Ugh." I say as we walk toward everybody. "What happended? " KC asks as we go inside. "Pizza guy is a jackass." Liam mumbled never taking his hand off my hip. "What the hell did he do ?" Oliver said as I put down the pizzas and get the plates out. "Okay Liam, I'm fine. He's not gonna pop up randomly and flirt." I said unhooking him from me. "He flirted with you? " Ryan said as Oliver rolled his eyes. "Nothing you can do about it dude." Jasper said leaning back in the chair. "How did you guys meet ?" Drew finally said. "Store." We both say. "Which store ?" Hannah persists. "Blues super market." Liam said rolling his eyes. "Fine, do you love her ?" Kayla asks as Liam grabs a slice. "Yes, I do." He said kissing me. "Ugh, PDA! PDA!!" Kayla said as Autumn coos. "Look if you guys could please not tell our families it'd be great." I said. "Tell your families what? "Izic said coming from the hallway. Liam pushes me away from him as I do the same to him. "That I forgot to do my essay for college and his dad is the teacher." I say shrugging. "Oh Grandma Nette would be very mad with that." he said cheekily. "You wouldn't dare." I say tensing up. "Oh I would." He says running away. I get up and go chase him.
Liam's POV:
Tessa goes and chases Izic to the living room."So if you and Tessa have babies can one of them be named after me?" KC asks sitting down on Spencer's lap. "I-. No-. Uh-." I stammer as we hear a crash. "Don't worry I got it." I say going to check on it. How can they talk about kids. We're barely 18. I mean I am but Tessa is 17. We aren't even in our senior year yet. "Oi Tessa are you alright? " I asked peeking in to see that she was bleeding on her leg and Izic was helping her up. I drop all my thoughts about kids and the future to go help her. "What happened ?" I ask helping her stand. "I was chasing him and I tripped and got cut on the edge of the table." She said wincing as she tried standing on it. I effortlessly pick her up bridal style. I take her to her bathroom in her room and Izic follows close behind. I set her on the counter and get a first aid kit  and some band-aids out. I take all of the splinters out of her wound and clean it. "Are you okay, Izic?" I say as I then wrap it with some gauze then add a Spongebob band-aid. "Yup,I'm good." He said as I help Tessa down."Thanks Dr.Ellison." she said joking. "You're welcome Miss." I say starting to clean everything up. "Sorry Mr.Izic but you seem  to have an appointment with Dr.Ellison." She said grabbing his arm and dragging him over. "Aunt Tessa, I'm okay." He said getting up but Tessa pushes him down. "No you aren't." She said as I start helping him up on the counter. I do the same process that I did with Tessa. "Thanks Liam." He said with a smile. "No problem Izic." I say as he jumps down. "Sorry aunt Tessa, I won't say anything to Grandma nette." He said hugging her. "It's okay, and I won't say anything to your mom." She says getting up. "You're the best !" He said running off. I laugh and walk back to the kitchen with her.
