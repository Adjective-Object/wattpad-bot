The day I laid my eyes on him, it left like my whole world literally stopped. He was different from any other guy with tattoos and a bad boy image.
He was sweet, funny, charming, and so much more a girl can look for in a guy. He was all I could think about everyday of every second. The first time we kissed, it felt like thousands of butterflies in my stomach and the way he held me in his strong arms were irresistible. Looking at him with those beautiful emerald eyes that would take every girls breath away.
We both had the same ambitions in life that we always wanted to do without anyone stopping us. Sometimes I could tell that he had a dark past that he couldn't seem to let go and a part of me wanted to know so badly that made him the way he is today.
I didn't care what people or my parents had to say about us. They wouldn't understand how much I cared for him and that I didn't want to be with someone that only cared  for all the money they have, the fancy cars, and rich lifestyle. I just didn't want any of that stuff.
The day I was forbidden to see him, gosh it felt like someone stabbing me in my heart over and over again. All I wanted to do was see him, talk to him, kiss him, feel him... just anything that would take the aching pain away and I knew he felt the same when he saw them taking me away and he couldn't do anything to stop it.
But we both knew that we'd find each other again and that no one can stop us. This man that came into my life and changed everything... his name is Harry ... Harry Styles and this is my story of how i Rose Parker was forbidden to be with the man that took my heart and made me fall truly, madly, and deeply love with.
