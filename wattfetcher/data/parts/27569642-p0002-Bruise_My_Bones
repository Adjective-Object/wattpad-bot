"Green, favourite idol?"
"Kurt Cobain, you?" A smirk, plasterd on my face.
"Michael Bubl√©, favourite song?"
"Adams song, blink-182, you?"
"Viva La Vida, coldplay, instruments?"
"Nope, okay okay, lets get serious, boy crush?"
"Justin Beiber" He says proudly.
"No way, you dork!" We start laughing, and don't realise our food has arrived. He stuff our faces with chicken, as his phone buzzes. He gets his phone out and reads his text.
"My friends are comin to nandos to meet us, that cool" I look to my watch and gasp.
"I can't, im late for something. I get up and ask the waitress to wrap up my food. Niall snatches my phone and does something before handing it back to me. I look at the new contact "Leprechaun" and laugh. I spray myself before heading out the door.
"Bye leprechaun" He waves with a full mouth and I head out. Im not late to anything, I have no plans, I know he was talking about the rest of one direction, and no offence, I hate them.
