My name is Gizela Fuentes, I am a 13 year old, and I go to Houma Junior High. At the school there are two groups the Haters and the Lovers. The haters are the bullies or bad boys in the school, Kane Hebert, Johnathan Willson, Angel Hernandez, and Julian Brownlie. The lovers are the good girls in the the school, they are me, Madison Collins, Ali DeLoach, and Jasiah Brown.
The haters and the lovers were sworn enemies from the moment they met.
