Ugh....Monday morning are THE worst!I turn over and look at my cat clock. Its 6:12 A.M. I should get up and ready for school but its like my bed is begging me to stay!At 6:30 i finally get up and start getting ready for school. I put on a "Homies" shirt with cats on it and my teal jeans. I get my everyday makeup on and pack my backpack.Today hunter and i are going to Tim Hortons for breakfast in honor of our birthday tradition.I put on my leather Egyptian sandals and head out the door. Since hunter isn't here yet i plop down book my porch.At 6:55 he finally shows up!We stop at Stanley's to get Arizona tea and TownClub Sodas. Then we stop at Tim Hortons and get our usual, an everything bagel toasted with regular cream cheese.~•~Here is where things get a little strange~•~We arrive at school, we have all but one of the same classes.My favorite class, science, is first!We are sitting in class reading our textbooks and all of the sudden the fire emergency bell goes off! Everyone scrambles out of the school like they are handing out free drinks at starbucks.When i get out of the building i see my mom standing in the parking lot.She wave to me so i leave Hunter with his other friends and walk over to my mom... As i get closet i as that she has been crying so i say, "Momma im ok" and ask "Whats wrong?!" She looks shaky but is able to say, "Its....Its your father...." And as soon as those words come out of her mouth she faints.I run over to Hunter and we call an ambulance. Hunter and i ride with my mom to the hospital.
My mom was unconscious for about 2 hours and when she gained consciousness again, the doctor came in to tell us it was just a result of minor stress and that she is perfectly fine.
Hunter drives us home in his funny little car.The school calls to say that the fire emergency bell was set off by a student trying to pull a "funy" prank and that no damage was done to the building.They also tell me i can have 2 days off to stay with my mom and i jump for joy when i hear that! YES!!!
