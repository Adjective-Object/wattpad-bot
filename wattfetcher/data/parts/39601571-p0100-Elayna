Why is no one ever active on my books?
I see in my news feed that you guys comment or vote or what ever on other peoples books, but you never do for me.
I just asked a simple question but not one person could of commented? Not one? It seriously takes 3 seconds.
But you can on other peoples?This isn't even about votes. I'm mad about the comments. I ask something because I really needed/wanted to know something, but nothing.
I could say that I was going to kill myself and I bet there wouldn't be any comments.
I only get comments when there's a Q&A. and even then only 2 people comment. And ask inappropriate questions.
Like, really guys?
