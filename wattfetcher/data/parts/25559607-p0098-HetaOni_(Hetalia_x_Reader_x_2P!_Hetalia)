I will help them get out of this mansion. All of us will get out of this mansion. I don't...need to side with those 2Ps... I won't allow them to put more suffering to such good people. They're...they're my favourite anime characters. Hetalia has been an important part of my life. I may not be that pretty, or smart, or talented, or strong...but Hetalia is one of those things in life that make me smile. It means that much to me. I don't know what I can do for them yet, but I'll do all that I can possibly do to get us all out of this mansion.
After a long silence, I spoke. "No."
"No?"
"No, Oliver. I won't play your twisted game. I won't allow you guys to kill them. I will get us all out of this mansion--without your help."
He clicked his tongue. "My my, poppet. Do you know what you're saying? Ah. Maybe you're just a bit famished! Here, have a cupca--" he said as he tried to shove a cupcake in my mouth.
I swatted his arm, making him drop the cupcake. "I don't want that, Oliver. Please, just leave us alone."
Oliver gave me a stoic look and spoke monotonously,
"If you won't help us...we'll kill you too."
I took another step back. Kill me?... They'll...kill me... I know they can but...
Fear and terror was all I felt at the moment. I was just speechless so I looked down to my feet.
It crossed my mind just now.
What if...I did die here?
What then?
....How could I have been so stupid? I could've just sped things up and helped them get out of here while there was still the chance.
Ah...but the 2Ps will probably do something about it if I did, right?
I'm sorry....what should I do...?
Help...the 2Ps...?
No... I can't...
Help the 1Ps..?
Of course...there's still hope for them to get out of here with me, right?
....Die trying..?
....
I'm sorry.
"Poppet, let's go." Oliver said as he placed a hand on my shoulder.
I was torn on what to do and just closed my eyes shut, "N-No...I don't...."
Suddenly, the door behind me was flung open as another man with a British accent shouted, "______!"
It was England.
When I opened my eyes to look at Oliver...he already disappeared.

I took a deep breath and looked at all the Second Players.
"Why....Why do you guys need to kill them, anyway?" I asked.
Allen took a step forward, "Doll, they're not the only ones who suffered a shitty time here. We had a fucked up life, too, because of them. It's only fair to return the favour."
