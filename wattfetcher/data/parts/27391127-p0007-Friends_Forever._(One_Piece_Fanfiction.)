FILLER Chapter 6 - Suna, Mizu and Shukai. Part 1.
"Eh? You're going to the beach this weekend? " Aya exclaimed as she sat next to Nami in the Straw Hat's dorm.
"Yeah, we need a change of scenery every now and then." Nami explained pointing to the idiots who were trying to do Maths.
"Ah, Saki-chan,  since you're so smart do my homework for me." Luffy whined.
An irk mark appeared on Sakura. "My name is Sakura! " She yelled hitting Luffy.
"Honestly,  you guys need to grow up." Haruka stated walking over to Sakura and Luffy.
"Your point is? "
"Luffy decided to invite Law, Ace and Kid. "
"Ace-kun." Haruka whispered blushing.
"Law -sama! " Aya cheered.
"That bastard again."
"So are you going?"
"I'm starting to change my mind." Sakura answered being very unsure about the presence of the red head.
"Mine too." Aya agreed with the same thought.
"We're definitely gonna be there!" Haruka exclaimed with sparkles.
"Haruka! " both Aya and Sakura cried.
"Great,  see ya there. "
-------
"I hate you. "
"Foreverly."
"But Ace-kun will be there. " Haruka cried.
"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! " Sakura screamed which earned her a slap from Aya.
Haruka was wearing a unbuttoned blue Hawaiian shirt with his favorite swim trunks,  baby blue with bananas.
Aya was wearing a pink vest which showed the outline if her bikini top and a long skirt. (Similar to the one Robin wore after the timeskip.)
Sakura wore her blue bikini top with red flora designs with a matching bikini shorts. She merely wore a see through beach wrap and a straw hat.
"Aya -chwan!,  Sakura-chwan! You look sexy today!" Sanji exclaimed having a massive nosebleed.
During her laughter,  Sakura noticed her bracelet glowing.  "Ace is near."
"Hello minna. " Ace greeted.  Luffy went to talk to him and Haruka fainted.  Aya went to talk to Nami and Robin.
Sakura stayed by herself and merely enjoyed the laughter until she left his presence disturb the air.
Captain Kid walked quietly to the platform and looked for a long time at Sakura. With a frown on her face she got up and was ready to walk away until Kid pulled her back.
"You're not going anywhere, Shortie." Kid muttered loud enough to be heard only by her. She tried pulling herself but his grip was too strong.
Then she disappeared into thin air and appeared next to Chopper, who was far away from Kid,and stuck her tongue out.
This was the second time.
"This girl is getting on my nerves. "

Aya was talking to Nami about Kami knows what when she felt herself teleport into someone's arms.
"Heya."
