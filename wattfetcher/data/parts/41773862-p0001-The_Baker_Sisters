Autumn P.O.V. :
It all started many years ago, when I was 14 years old.
My mother owned a bakery called 'The Chocolate Chip', and it was popular in town. She and her sister, Aunt Becky, became awesome bakers.
That time, my sister Sophie was just a toddler and my youngest sister Michelle was just a baby. Our mother and Aunt Becky tought me and Sophie how to bake when I was nine, and it became my favorite hobby.
Finally, I graduated university in culinary arts. My mother was so proud of me, and Sophie is now twelve and Michelle is nine.
My name is Autumn Prescott, and I love to bake. I opened Cake and Bake in June, and specializing cupcakes. The turqouise walls, the pastel furniture, the big windows and the lace aprons- all seemed too perfect. I opened up the bakery in Pine Street, a busy side walk with many shops and restaurants. It was one of the tourists attractions, and I feel darn lucky to open my bakery there.
With some help from my sisters and my best friend, Callie, I knew that this will be as popular as my mother's bakery.
My mother and Aunt Becky closed down The Chocolate Chip because of some family wanted to open a pizzeria and gave my mother two MILLION dollars after a hard bargain. My mother and Aunt Becky was sad, but me and my sisters insisted them to have a break.
But opening up a bakery is harder than I thought it would be.
