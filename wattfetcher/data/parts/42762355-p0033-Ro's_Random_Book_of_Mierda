I just remembered the sixth season of Hetalia! Goddamnit I can't wait until the dubbed episodes are out owo
I went to see the art of this season and seriously, I've been rolling in my bed, fangasming and whining...
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Personally I think the fifth season was prettier--
BUT IT ISH SHOOO BOOTYFUL
I can't handle this!! GERMANYYYYHHH
FRANCE LOOKS FUCKING COOL
IGGY LOOKS LIKE A PERSON
THE NETHERLANDS MADE ME FORGET HOW TO BREATHE
RUSSIA IS JUST HOT DAMN FUCK ME WITH YOUR NUKE
AND ROMANO!! MMMHRHM ewe
But then I saw the Nordics...
What... What happened..?
Why is Iceland the only one who doesn't look lame..?
I swear I can't handle "Finland" being so fucking cheerful
Iceland has all the fangirls--
Sweden is sexy as always
BUT WHAT THE SHIT DID YOU DO TO DENMARK HE LOOKS SO NO DENMARK ; D ;
FICKEN HIMA-PAPA DONT MAKE ME FLIP SHIT
I CAN TAKE YOUR SUCKY ATTEMP OF TRYING TO CREATE FINLAND BUT DONT YOU FUCK UP DENMARK'S SEXINESS
DO NOT FUCK IT UP
And "Finland" is there like: "Ah, don't be like that, child ^-^ Ta-san looks fine as always!~"
o__e //twitch//
All I hear is "Whii whiii I want a cock up my ass Su-san give it to me bby let's have fun with Mr. Tanska he likes you too Twinkle Twinkle ^7^"
Yes. The hate is becoming more real.
//I accidentally saw SuFin, excuse me I'm still in shock//
Eh... It'll be a rough year for me in the Hetalia fandom, but well, there will be more good, since the new season is here! I'll just have to learn to accept Hetalia Finland, even tho (s)he is a bastard .__.
But I can't wait to see the Tomato Gang! * 7 * I love them all
And yeah
HETALIAAAHHH I HAVE SO MANY PICS OF DOITSU NOW
