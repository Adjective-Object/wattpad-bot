3) I update too much
4) I love Nico but he doesn't love me
5) Nico isn't real
6) I am real
7) I need music
9) bet you didn't notice I skipped 8
10) bet you just checked.
How do you guys go to sleep??
I'm like really HYPER right now!!!
Like I'm scared that if I'll go to sleep I'll dream about Marshmallow bunnies running around in a candy garden and then after a while my messed up mind will make the bunnies eat all the inhabitants and I'll end up having a nightmare and never eating marshmallows.
What's up with me and marshmallows??
