do you ever have that feeling where you want something bad to happen since nothing interesting happens in your life.so you purposely say outloud sarcastically
,"oh no!the basement door is open!i sure hope nothing bad happens!"or you purposely open your closets at night thinking if you do that then maybe something might creep out of the closet?
or when your at the store you think to yourself that you want someone to get hurt..and then right after you almost get hit with TEN THOUSAND SHOPPING CARTS MAKING YOU WANT TO FLIP THE CART OVER SCREAMING
,"LEARN.HOW.TO.PUSH.A.FUCKING.CART.WITHOUT.PUSHING.IT.INTO EVERYONE!"
but then you realize that it's your fault for wanting something bad to happen but you never expected that somone to be you?
just me?....oh..
just keep scrolling..you saw nothing(.____.)
