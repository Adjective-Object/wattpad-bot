"How was your little date?" Phil asked.
"Perfect." I told him smiling.
"Wow, I haven't seen you this happy in a long time Aust." He said, "But on other news. Jaxin's been blowing up our phones looking for you."
"What did you tell him?" I asked annoyed.
"We haven't talked to him. Where is your phone? Shouldn't he be blowing up your phone and not ours."
"Oh well you see funny story but my phone is ruined." I told them laughing a little.
"How?"
"We went on a row boat and it kind of flipped so... Neither of us have a phone right now."
He sighed, "I'm glad you had fun but you've got to get rid of Jax, now here's mine, call him."
"Why do I have to call him?" I whined, "Just block his number."
"Well do something about it! We've all blocked his number but the prick figures out how to keep getting in contact with us." Tino said, "You have to get rid of him before he ruins your relationship with Alan or something worse."
"Fine." I said snatching his phone away.
"Good, now go make that call."
"Alright," I said and stood up. "If Alan asks just tell him I'm making an important phonecall." I told them and went outside for privacy.
I dialed the number and waited for him to answer which he did after a few rings.
"Hello?"
"Jaxin," I said.
"Oh hi Austin."
"You've been calling me, texting and not leaving my friends alone. You got to stop Jaxin. What do you want?"
"Let's hook up." He said.
"Let's not." I told him, "I gave you your last chance and you blew it. I'm with someone else now."
"Someone else? Who else wants you? Austin, it has always been you and I."
"Yes someone wants me!" I snapped, "And it's not you and I anymore. You ruined that when you left last time."
"Is it that stupid kid?" He asked, "Because he isn't going to be able to please like I can."
"He's not stupid Jax and I bet he can do a lot better of a job than you ever could."
"Didn't I tell you to stay away from him?" He demanded.
"You don't own me so stay the hell away from me." I said and hung up going back inside. "I talked to him." I grumbled throwing the phone at Aaron.
"And?" He asked.
"And he's still an ass. Its whatever, I'm going to bed."
"Alright well goodnight." Aaron said.
"Night!" Phil and Tino both yelled as I headed off to the bunks. I opened up the curtain to my bunk and saw Alan there already, fast asleep. He looked so cute, I climbed in carefully so that I didn't wake him up. I brushed some hair from his face and kissed his forehead softly.
"Goodnight baby." I said pulling him a little closer before falling asleep.
