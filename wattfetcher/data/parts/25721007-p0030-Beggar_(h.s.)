After a minute or so, we stop at a jail cell that's occupied by a sleeping man in the corner. Though, it's not just any random prisoner. It's the father of my child and my worst enemy, Brock.
"Get up Styles. You have visitors," the one guard barks, "And don't try anything.. we're watching."
Brock attempts to stand up and once he does, I can see what living in a cell has done to him so far. His face is filled with black specks of stubble and he definitely lost some weight. Once he sees who came to visit, he projects a toothy, yellow smile.
"Hello," he greets us, "How are my two favorite people doing?"
"Cut the act asshole," Harry growls. My eyes travel to the corner of the hallway and I spot the two guards who took us here, watching us with careful eyes. I really hope Harry doesn't do anything for his own sake.
"What act?" Brock chuckles, "So why are you here anyway? Come to beat me up?"
"You'd be dead if you weren't in here," Harry almost shouts.
"You got me pregnant, Brock," I blurt out, getting straight to the point. Harry yelling at him and threatening him will bring us exactly no where.
"You're kidding me.. right?" He asks. His sarcastic and cheery personality turns blank and unexpressive.
I give him a nod, "No, I'm not joking with you."
"Well, what are you going to do with the baby?" He questions with a tone full of seriousness.
"To be quite honest, I don't really know," I sigh. This is the hardest decision of my life. I'm finally starting to get it back together and now I find out I'm having a child. I'm not ready yet.
"Do I have a say in this?" Brock pipes. No matter how much he begs, I'm not going to let him see the baby if I keep it. I rather have Harry be the child's fatherly figure instead.
"No fucking way!" Harry barks. I don't blame him, but his harsh tone almost makes me feel bad from Brock.. almost.
"Is there a problem here?" The guard asks from behind.
"Not at all," I tell him before Harry can say a word. We don't need to be kicked out of a damn prison. This is vital to talk to Brock about our current situation.
"If you want to get an abortion, I refuse to sign the papers," he admits once the guard walks away again. To be quite honest, I'm not really sure if I like the idea of basically killing a child's life.
"Look, I don't even know what I'm going to do about this yet," I sigh. I'm tired of being in this scary place and I don't want to be here any longer.
"Choose soon.. and wisely," Brock says as Harry and I walk back down the hallway of jail cells. We interlock fingers again.
My mind travels to many places as we continue out the station and into his car. I have no idea what I'm going to do about this unplanned child. If Brock wasn't the father of the baby, I would consider keeping it as my own. I'm contemplating between keeping it, giving it up for adoption, or, worst of all, getting an abortion. I hate having to even think about the last option, but I do not want the child to have Brock as a dad. This night turned from amazing to utter shit.
"Happy fucking birthday to me.."
Hey guys!! Probably won't be updating again until next week. Sorry for the crappy chapter. I'll try harder next time. Lol.
