It was the last day of school. To be specific the last day of 8th grade. We were all I'm our last class (English). The clock said 2:59 and every one started counting down to summer.* RING* everyone ran out of the class. Summer has finally started yes!!
Buy the way I'm Lexi. I'm 14 and live in Louisiana. I'm about 5'4 with brown hair to match my coffee colored eyes.
It was 2 weeks after summer started and I had nothing to do. All my friends went on the exchange student program in chile. My Little sister lilly was at summer camp for the day while my mom went to work. This was already the most boring summer ever!
"Lexi" called my mom. I guess they were home. "Yea" I said walking to the kitchen. "Hey Hun how were you""good just bored" "Well I have something for you to do, but first go get dressed. " she said smiling. "Ok" and with that I ran upstairs and changed. I was wearing a pair of Jean shorts and a crop top that said FLAWLESS.
Once I was down stairs my mom handed me 2 baskets filled with Louisiana stuff. There was a Louisiana cook book and some cooking supplies,a Louisiana survival guide,and list of fun thing to do here. Mostly there was LSU stuff. Since my uncle was one of the football coaches we got ALOT of stuff. Especially because he didn't have any kids of his own.
"Mom is all this stuff for the new neighbors." "Yea I thought it would be nice to welcome them into the neighborhood with a gift basket. Plus Elizabeth and her family are very nice. " "Ohh KK cools" "Can you go over and give this to them please." "Sure thing" I said after smiling sweetly.
As I walked over to their house I saw two guys carrying boxes in being bossed around by a little girl. She looked about Lilly's age. Then I saw A familiar face. It was mrs Grier. Her, my mom and I were talking about the new house 3 weeks ago.
" hey honey how are you" she said walking over to me "Good, how about you?" "Can't complain" " that's good, my mom sent me with some 'Welcome to the neighborhood gifts' I said handing her the baskets. "Oh how sweet, we'll come inside and l show you around" "Sure" I said following her inside. "This is Skylynn" Elizabeth said walking into the kitchen. " Hey what's your name ?" she asked "I'm Lexi" "Cool name, mom I like her." She said taking my hand. "Well I'm glad. Since she will be your new babysitter. If it's ok with you Lexi. " "Yes of course. I'd love to babysit Skylynn ." "Good I'll go thank your mom and talk to her about the babysitting. Skylynn can you show her around and finish painting your toy chest?" "Yep. Come on Lexi. Let's go" she said pulling my arm. Hayes P.O.V My family and I were almost finished unpacking the boxes for the new house. I wasn't really excited about the move because all my friends were back home. I mean Im pretty good at making new friends and football would help with that but it just wasn't the same. This summers sure to be boring. Mom had promised me my friends could spend part of the summer with us, so I guess there's. I had football practice every morning at 5:00 starting in July and nothing else to do. I thought all of our neighbors were old people or young couples with newborns but I was wrong. "I'm Lexi" she said This girl look about my age. She was pretty and carried herself well. I wasn't really looking for a girlfriend but just for someone to spend my summer with. Like a best friend. I don't really hang out with girls a lot they tend to melt when they see me so I stay away for they're benefit😜. (Lol just wanted to put that in there. He's not cocky or anything tho) but something about her was different.
A/n Thanks for reading. Please comment if you want me to continue. Idk if it's good or not it's my first book. Thanks 🙈😂🙏🏽🙏🏽💖💜
