"Hey mama." I said.
"Hey baby."she said grabbing Devin from the back seat.
I kissed her cheek and the girls ran off.
"Yall not even gonna say bye to your mama?" I asked.
"Oh sorry mama." Melanie said before hugging and kissing me goodbye.
"Bye baby." I said after kissing and hugging her back.
Cara kicked the gravel in the pave coming towards me. She hugged me putting her arms tightly around my neck.
"Mommy." She said
"Yes baby?" I asked her.
"Grammy and Papi house no that fun." She said. "I-if you want I stay with you." She said.
I chuckled lightly. "Aw baby no. Have fun with Grammy and Papi." I kissed her.
"You sure?" She asked.
"Yes baby. I'm positive." I said.
"Oh okay." She said lowly.
I kissed her and she went into the house.
"Alright girl bye!" My mother said.
"Really ma? Gimme my son." I poured and she handed him over.
He smiled reaching out for my face. "You gin miss you momma?" I asked him biting his cheeks. "I think you gon miss you mamas."
"Alright alright." My mother said scooping him out of my arms. "Bye." She repeated.
"Where daddy?" I asked her.
"He went to the store. I'm making the kids peach cobbler and forgot something." She said.
"I thought you said you wasn't gonna help me when I got pregnant?" I asked her.
"I told you that when you thought you were grown that night and went to the club underaged. Now you grown and got three. I got to help you." She said looking in my face.
"Mama." I said seeing she was trying to read me.
"What girl?" She asked me.
"Nothing ma." I said turning my head.
"Go home. Enjoy your house and your husband." She shooed me.
"Yes ma'am." I said and went to my truck after kissing on Devin some more.
"Lauren baby!" She said.
"Ma'am?" I asked her
"The next time you roll your eyes at me I'm gonna take em out you hear?" She asked.
I laughed. "Yes ma'am." I said and got into the truck.
