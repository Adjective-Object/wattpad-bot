Not long after the movie finished and Chase and I were just laying on his bed and talking my phone went off. I got up off the bed and went to the kitchen area where my iPhone 5s was charging next to Chase's iPhone six. I had turned the sound on so I could hear my phone if it went off when the movie was on. I just got two texts so I unplugged my phone and walked back to Chase's room. I laid down next to him, this time my back was facing him not face to face this time. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me closer to him so we were spooning - not in any inappropriate way. I'm glad he respects me. Anyway, I got a text from my mom saying I should be home before midnight, and Zachary, my brother will be at home tomorrow for dinner if I wanted to join my family. And my mom also said its okay if I don't join them because Anna is hanging out with me this weekend. Then the other text was from Anna she said he and Ryan were in were hanging out his his RV. I sent an 'okay, we'll be home soon! :)' to my mom and a 'same - I'm in Chase's RV. we should leave soon :/" Anna replied back with a ' :'( Ryan is going to bring me to Chase's RV. We gonna hang with Chase & Ryan tomorrow?' And my mom responded back with a ':) C U all soon!'
I didn't answer Anna's question via text. I figured I see her shortly I'll tell her in the car home. "I don't want you to go yet." Chase said into my hair as he pullede closer to him. "Chase, I'll see you tomorrow," I started to getup off the bed but he just tightened his grip. "Chase, I should go and put my leggings on before Anna and Ryan get here and assume something.""Let them assume what ever they want!" He kinda raised his voice but it was muffles because me was talking into my sholder. "Chase" I said firmly. He finally lose ed his grip and I somehow managed to get untangled from his arms. I walked out to the living room area and took the tag off then slipped the white leggings on.
