I turned around in his arms so that I was facing him and wrapped my own around his neck.
"I'm being very sarcastic. I don't enjoy anyone's pain... okay that's a lie i enjoy some evil fictional character's pain, like Dick Roman, but that's different. I do however enjoy teasing the shit out of you."
"I think most people enjoy pain that would come to Dick Roman."
"This is true." I smiled up at him and gently pecked his lips. "By the way, I'll miss you too." I whispered the last part quietly against his lips.
"Who wouldn't miss me, I'm awesome."
"Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd you ruined it." I pulled out of his arms, with a fake pout on my lips.
I walked around him to grab my charger.
When I got back behind Paul, he laughed. "You know I'm joking. You're the only one here that's awesome."
I smacked his ass, smiling. "You know it."
