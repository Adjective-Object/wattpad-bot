The monster was staggering already, but it still charged after them. "YoU...Won't...Esc...aPe..."



England and Japan nodded at each other and executed their joint skill, "Island Country".


Falling and backing away slowly, the creature slumped on the floor, obviously weakened.



England's party was victorious!
2 EXP were received!
100 HETA were obtained!
Onigiri was found!
Hot Pepper was found!





England smiled ecstatically as he saw the monster's condition. "Yes! That's enough! Let's run! Now that it's this weakened, it won't catch up with us!" he said, grabbing Japan's arm.


Japan was about to run, too, but then he remembered something and looked down. "Oh! W-wait! I'm sure America's glasses are-"


"We don't have time to look for them! Let's just get away! This is our only chance!" England told him.


Nodding, Japan apologised to his friend under his breath. "V-very well...I'm sorry, America."


Safely, England and Japan managed to escape the annexe.

Arriving at the saferoom, England and Japan were greeted by worried Northern Italian. Â "Oh, thank God! I was just about to go and help you!" Italy exclaimed.


"We really couldn't kill it, but at least we got to escape. How is America doing?" England asked, looking around the room for the American.


Italy gestured towards the beds on the other side. "Well, he's calmed down. He's sleeping now."
