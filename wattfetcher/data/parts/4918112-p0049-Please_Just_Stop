One thing I will say before I begin this is that America does not have the worst school system.
With this being said, it's still pretty bad.
I will also say that this rant will be pretty short, as I don't have too much to say, just that America and the schools piss me off.
This rant was spurred from... two or three weeks ago, when I was sick and so decided to go watch my brother's spelling bee. It was sad and pathetic, to say the least.
I got there at nine thirty in the morning with my mom's boyfriend so that we can watch, and they're having a practice round to warm them up. We're talking First Grader words here, for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. I kid you not, about half of those kids got their words wrong. BASIC words.
And it just got worse from there. In the fourth round, someone had Talisman and they put a random C in it. What? How do you...
Excuse me while I go purge my brain of the sheer stupidity I witnessed.
*Ahem!*
Now then. This anecdote, while very boring and extremely vague, has a point to it.Â What is America's public school education coming to?
Think about it. What is the school system really coming to? How are we stacking up against the rest of the world?
Something interesting, actually, there's a set of statistics for the leading countries in Science, English and Math. Even better, we aren't anywhere NEAR the top of that list. You know who is? Canada. Canada is ranked second in a couple, I think, and is LEADING in one. I don't remember which subject, but they are. America? We're in the 25-35 range in the statistic. Not the worst, sure, but certainly not the best.
We're getting really pathetic. Kids can't even spell first grade words in a spelling bee. Someone from my Freshman Orientation couldn't even spell Microsoft! And to add insult to injury, the amount of illiterate assholes, both on this website and in public schools in America, is astounding.
No wonder this site is so successful. Canada really has their head in the game.
