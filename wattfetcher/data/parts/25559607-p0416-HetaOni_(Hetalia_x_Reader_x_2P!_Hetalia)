Past (Name) didn't know how to reply to what he said. All she knew was that the Italian was starting to lose it. Past Luciano thrashed around the room, breaking and throwing anything he could take hold of.
"Those-Those bastardi! I...I can't...They're not!! No....No!! They weren't supposed to die! They weren't supposed to leave me! " Past Luciano rambled loudly, pulling his auburn hair. He was starting to go ballistic.
Not able to take seeing Past Luciano like that any longer, Past (Name) approached the Northern Italian. "Luci...Luci, stop...please...you....you look like you're going to hurt yourself..." she said.
"But...(Second Name)...Lutz and Kuro are...not only them...Flavio....and everyone else...." Past Luciano said in between uncontrollable sobs. As much as he never wanted Past (Name) to see him so...vulnerable, he just couldn't handle it anymore.
Seeing the Italian's condition, Past (Name) pulled the man into a hug, hoping that it could calm him down. Past Luciano tightly hugged back, finding comfort in the girl's arms. For a while, they were just silent. They've both seen things they never wanted to see, and lost people they never dreamt of loosing. ...And it was all because of this blasted mansion.
They both knew...they had to leave.
Once Past Luciano had calmed down, they both left the room and headed downstairs.

The scene before them slowly started to change. Meanwhile, (Name) turned to Luciano and spoke, "...I...Luciano..."
"...The memories...are self-explanatory. Convenient for you, isn't it?" he said emotionlessly. He seemed like he wanted to act just like how he did in the memory...but he knew better now. Meeting the girl's gaze, Luciano spoke, "I know...judge me all you want about this...I don't care... It was most likely our fault for making those creatures...I understand that now. And I should accept it, too...but..."
"....but...?" (Name) urged him to continue.
Looking down, Luciano spoke, "...but I can't accept...the fact....that you had to die, too..."
The scene fully changed into a place that used to give (Name) such a nostalgic feel. It was the far end of the hallway down at the second floor.

"Where...are the First Players? Why haven't we bumped into any of them?" Past (Name) asked, as she exited one of the rooms.
Past Luciano shrugged. "My guess is that the flow of time in this mansion had gone beyond awry...that, or something else we do not know of..."
"...Something else..." Past (Name) trailed. After a moment, her eyes widened. "This-This is the second time loop for them...so... England might have...went back in time...?"
"What? I thought only my First Player counterpart could.." Luciano said, confusion shown in his tired eyes.
