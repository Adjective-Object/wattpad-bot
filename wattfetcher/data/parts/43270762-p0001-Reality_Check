I walked in behind my Aunt Ruby and Connor. My Aunt Ruby looked old and frail, but somehow strong for 88, even with her cane. Alongside her was my oldest brother, Connor. He had just turned seventeen and was so close to finally becoming a man. Following them was my other brother, Ian. He was fourteen and as he walked his bright blue eyes shined bright with tears as if he could have sensed what had happened. Next to him was my Great Aunt Bette. She looked as worried as I have ever seen her. Then, was me trailing slowly behind them. I was a fresh-faced twelve-year-old girl who wasn't quite sure what was going on and was scared to find out. I took a look around for the first time, and yup, we were in a hospital all right.
There were five or six people sitting in the neatly lined up chairs in the waiting room and one lady behind the receptionist desk. Finally, I saw my mom. My mom looked scared, her big blue eyes were lined with tears and you could tell she had been crying. I could tell the situation was bed, but somehow, she still managed to have a smile on her face for the sake of her family.
As we walked down the never-ending hallway, passing room after room, my Great Aunt Bette was frantically telling my mom, "You need to tell the kids. They need to know." My mom just nodded slightly as she softly knocked on the door to a room.
A young man answered the door. I could tell he was a doctor by his clothes. I entered the room last, it was smaller than I expected and I didn't see who I was looking for. I looked around and saw a couple of couches, chairs, my dad, and my grandma. Everyone was there but him. I could tell everyone had been crying from their red cheeks and puffy eyes. I had never seen my father or grandma cry before. It suddenly hit me how serious the situation was.
"I'm sorry for your loss. Take as long as you need," was all the doctor said before he walked out.
