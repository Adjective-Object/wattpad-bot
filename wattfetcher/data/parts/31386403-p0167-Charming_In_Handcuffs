We walked pretty far from the diner. Not sure exactly how far, but we've been walking for over an hour and we're pretty far into town. The streets where quiet and buildings were dark. Nothing at all going on around us. It almost felt post-apocalyptic.
Jack suddenly stopped in front of a dark alley and it jerked me to a stop. He dropped my hand and stepped further into the darkness, "Jackâ€”"
And then he dropped to his knees in a puddle of water and leaned forward on his elbows with his head in hands.

I wanted this chapter to be super intense but it didn't work out that way, lol. But I hope you guys enjoyed it! And Jack is on his way to freedom. Also the next chapter will be a major one so get excited (Totally kidding but it will be major)
And pleaaaaasee vote? And comment? :)))))
Love you all bunches! :)
