___________PARTY NIGHT_____________
MIA'S POV
i went to zoe's after school because we wanted to get ready together , so at 5:30 we started getting ready.
"i totally love that dress on you" zoe said
"oh darlin' it's just my awesome figure" we laughed
"but seriously you look hot , i'm sure by the end of the party you'll be asked out"
"we'll see" i said with a smile
i wore a red dress with a gold belt and white heels . i put some red lipstick ,mascara and eyeliner.
as for zoe , she wore a black tight dress and red high heels and some make up. she looked great , actually she looks great all the time , that's probably why she has a boyfriend but i don't.

"OMG from now on we are calling dylan my bae" i said laughing
"but he is isn't he" she said joking
"yeah he is"
the party was going great , me and zoe were dancing to our fav song try hard by 5sos . when someone bumped into me , i fell and i was soooo embarrassed , all eyes were on me . the person who bumped into me helped me up , i looked at him and WOW he was really handsome , he was tall , with black hair and blue eyes .

"oh you're not alone i'm right here" steve said
"oh i don't wanna bother you , you probably have your friends waiting or something an-"
"don't be silly c'mon i'll get you a drink"
