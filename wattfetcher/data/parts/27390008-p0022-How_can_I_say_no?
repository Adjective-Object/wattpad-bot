Three days later, johnny was watching Samantha freak out. She was running her hands through her hair all the time and shaking and biting her nails. She was a wreck.
"Johnny. I need you to do something for me." Samantha said one day. Johnny looked up from his book.
"What you need?" He asked. Setting the book to the side, he put his legs over the edge of the couch. Samantha sat on the edge of the coffee table in front of him.
"Ineed you to go to the store and get me..." She started. Johnny shook his head.
"I'm not getting you any razors. End of story. Stop asking." He said.
"But johnny. Then at least help me stop thinking about it! I'm going crazy!" She cried. Johnny took her hands.
"I know. I know. It'll get better trust me. You got me now. I'm make it better. I'm gonna get your mind off it. You got a dress?" He asked. Samantha nodded and watched johnny rub his thumb over her hand.
"Yeah." She whispered. Johnny smiled and kissed her knuckles.
"Good. Go get dressed in it. Meet me in the lobby in half an hour." He said. Samantha shook her head.
"I don't wanna be away from you when I'm like this. What if I hurt myself?" Samantha asked as she looked up into Johnny 's eyes and slid into his arms. Johnny held her tightly.
"I know. Don't worry. You'll be fine." He whispered.
"Promise?" Samantha asked as she titled her head back to look at him.
"I promise." Johnny said. Samantha nodded and stood on her toes to kiss him. Johnny smiled as the pulled away. "Stop making this so hard. Go." He said as she went into her suite. He went back to his and got ready.
------half an hour later-------
Samantha walked out of the elevator and into the lobby. She looked around for johnny. She didn't see him anywhere.
Miss Hoffman?" A man asked. Samantha turned.
"Yes." She said. The man motioned for her to follow him.
"I'm supposed to take you to meet Mr. Depp at the restaurant. Please follow me." He said. Samantha followed him out to a long limo and got in. Within ten minutes, they were at a restaurant. Samantha got out and thanked the man. She walked in.
"Rservation?" A young girl asked. Samantha shook.
"Uhm....." She said. "I think it's under depp." She said. The young girl nodded.
"I'm sorry miss but just to be sure you're the girl he's waiting for, I need some ID of some sort." The girl asked.
"That won't be needed. She's the girl I'm waiting for." Johnny said. Samantha turned to look at him. He stepped out of the shadow and Samantha got a good look at him. He was dressed in a black suit with a black tie over a white dress shirt. Looking down, Samantha smiled when she saw that he was actually wearing dress shoes instead if combat boots for once. Looking up to meet his eyes, she smiled when she saw he had chosen to wear his contacts. Looking just over his eyes, she saw he had dyed his hair. Blonde. She smiled even more.
"This is amazing johnny." She said as he led her to a table. She saw the table and laughed at how cliche it was. A white tablecloth lay over the table. In the middle was a single candle burning bright. Sitting across her plate was a single red rose. Samantha turned to johnny and hugged him tight. "Thank you. It looks amazing." She whispered in his ear. Johnny laughed.
"The best is yet to come love." He said. Samantha nodded and pulled away from him. Johnny held out her chair and she sat down. He sat down opposite her.
