"I heard that it was much bigger than before, but... he wasn't surprised at all, was he?" Canada asked.


Russia furrowed his brows. "You mean he already knew? Or..."


China shook his head and spoke slowly, "We should think... that he's already seen it many times over."

Romano didn't answer, making Spain worry and nudge him, " Roma?"


"......I do know.I don't know everything, but I know more than you do." Romano admitted.


Prussia's eyes widened with a bit of hope, "Then..."
