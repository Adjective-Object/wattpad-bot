What? Why? How! This is one of my favorite songs! I really want it to stay! But I guess it's time to let it go. Sorry for the Frozen reference... Anyway if you voted for this song you get to vote again. There are like 3 songs that only need one more to get out so I'm excited to see which one gets out. So Lets Get Started!
And the nominees are:
TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME
LET THE RAINBOW REMIND
HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
WELCOME TO THE SHOW
SHINE LIKE RAINBOWS
PERFECT DAY FOR FUN
Good luck to the nominees!
