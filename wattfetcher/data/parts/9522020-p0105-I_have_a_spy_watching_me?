"Jaycie you need to not bleed out and they can help. I'll stay with you the whole time." He promised.
I was truly hesitant but I nodded an okay and he did all the way.  He helped me up by picking me up and put me on the stretcher.  I held onto his hand and I just wanted him to climb on and hug me.  He helped them get me out and I didn't want the IV.  They put me in the car and they were going to tell Chase to stay.  Then he pulled the guy on the side and then the man said he can come.  I held onto his hand gratefully.  Then they drove there with a lot of questions to me and Chase to know what happened.
