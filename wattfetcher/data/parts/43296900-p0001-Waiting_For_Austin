A sigh escapes Liam's lips as he drops his bag and quickly pulls his scuffed trainers off after the long school day, but a smile appears on his miserable face when he remembers. Summer.
A time when people can escape for 7 weeks without the exhausting thought of school.
But, like most teenagers his age, Liam knows exactly how his summer is going to go... Staying up late and sleeping all day, and watching Netflix, and talking to Austin.
Austin.
Austin.
Liam can't help but smile as he switched on his laptop.
Austin.
A close friend, one of the only people he can really trust. Yet, he's never met him.

Liam smiles, hesitating before sending a message, with an emoticon:
Hey :) How was your day?

Liam laughed quietly to himself, putting his laptop to the side, waiting for the message notification to sound.
Only this time, it didn't.
