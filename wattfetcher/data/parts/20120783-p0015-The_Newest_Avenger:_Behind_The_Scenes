Hey
Yo!
"Will you cut it out?! You just made me die in Flappy Bird. I was about to beat my high score too"
"Wait, did you just say Flappy Bird?"
"Yes I did, now cut it out!"
I couldn't contain my laughter any longer. I was laughing so hard my sides were hurting. I couldn't believe he was addicted to Flappy Bird. Once I calmed myself down, I noticed Robert glaring at me.
"Fine, missy, what's your high score" he smirked.
"254" I happily replied. His face dropped and he turned back to his phone. I giggled and received another glare from him. Better not piss him off.
"So, Alexis, is this your first film?" I heard someone ask.
"Yup, first one" I replied to Jeremy.
"What about T.V or commercials?"
"Nope. This will be my first time in front of a camera"
"But you've acted before, right?"
"Oh, yeah! I've done a lot of shows in my hometown, but nothing big"
"Plays or musicals?"
"Both but mostly musicals"
"So you're a singer?"
"I wouldn't consider myself a singer"
"But you sing?"
"If I have to, yeah"
"Interesting. I'll have to hear you sometime"
"Yeah, no"
I had conversations with the rest of the cast and I was warming up to them. I couldn't wait to start training next month and film with all of them.
After a few hours, everyone decided to head home. I said goodbye to everyone and got into Robert and Susan's car.
"Have fun mini me?" Robert asked me.
"Yup!"
They drove me to my hotel and Robert got out of his car to walk me to the door. We got to the door and he hugged me.
"If you need to talk, come and find me. I'm always here to listen" he whispered in my ear.
"Thanks, that means a lot" I whispered back.
With that, he messed up my hair and waved goodbye. I waved back and watched them drive off.
What a good day, I thought and walked back to my hotel room.
