I wanted life to slow down so bad,
Maybe it's because everything was too fast;
The water running from the shower;
The growing insanity inside me;
The darkness I was too quickly falling into;
It was all too fast.
Life never slows down.
It seemingly goes by in two seconds.
I wish I could stop time, though.
Just enjoy the light and dark thoughts and feelings
I'm having.
Time washes over me like these sea salt waves
And it's out of my control.
Don't waste the life you have.
