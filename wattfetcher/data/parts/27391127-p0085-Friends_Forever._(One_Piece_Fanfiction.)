"Anybody got a towel for her?" Haruka asked and Ace immediately brought one. He offered to take Sakura back to her dorms for her change her clothes.
"Be more careful," Ace warned Sakura.
"He pissed me off."
"You bit him."
"He tried to threatened me."
"You almost drowned."
"At least I got saved saved but by that shitty demon!"
"I'll make it up to you. Pick a ride anyone and we'll go."
"Sakura hummed for a while before pointing to the biggest and longest slide. Immediately Ace's face turned another colour.
"Why that one?"
"Because its my first time riding one and I want to ride the biggest one!" Sakura exclaimed.
"Even its a love slide?"
"Yep."
When Ace and Sakura reached up there, familiar face were already there. Hancock, Haruka, Aya and Law.
"Hello minna~"
"Ace-sama~ <3" Haruka exclaimed spinning. In the distance, Aya and Sakura heard a faint 'Gomu Gomu no."
"Not this shit again." Sakura  said, her eye twitching.
"Not now. Disastrous things always happen." Aya agreed.
"What are you ladies talking about?" Ace asked walking over to them along with Law.
"Duck." Sakura said in one word.
"ROCKET!" Luffy screamed and the four ducked as directed, making Luffy crash into Hancock and Haruka.
"Wait.."
"Wait one bloody minute."
Too late.
Haruka and Hancock were already hugging each other on their way down the long water slide.
"Why the hell am I with you?" Haruka asked.
"Don't ask me."
In someone's imagination,
"D-Don't get too close." Hancock stuttered.
"Show that smile only to me." Haruka said seductively, getting closer to Hancock's face.
"Could this be the shipper's love they talk about?" Sakura asked with her hand over her mouth.
"What are you doing?" Aya asked.
"Nothing, I just wanted to see what happens next. Just kidding." Sakura said trying to lie a bit.
"Shishishishsi. I finally made it! Where's Hancock."
"You sent her flying."
"Sent who flying?"
"Haruka and Hancock."
"Where?" Luffy asked. With that Law pointed to the two that were currently making their way down the slide.
"Huh? How did she reach there? She had to wait for me. She's weird."
"YOU WERE THE ONE THAT CAUSED IT!"
"Anyways, Saki-chan go down the slide with me!"
"Hell nah."
"Aya?"
"Of cour-"
