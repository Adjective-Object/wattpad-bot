My name is Izzie and I'm 13 years old. I have a best friend named Truth who is bi. Ever since I meant her we were always koo. She always been there for me through thick and thin no matta what. I love her dearly. I really do. Now here's the thing. Truth's IN LOVE with me, but I don't know how I feel back. Sometimes I feel like I like her, then sometimes I feel like I don't. Like for example, my ex Tj. That was my first love, well I say that now but in the future I might realize he not. But for now I feel he is. Well so now I still have very small feelings for himðŸ‘Œlike that small, but I mean why wouldn't I he my FIRST love, that's hard to get over in a couple weeks. But like I was sayin when I'm with him and we playin around.((Not like that. Like play fighting and crap.)) I start seeing why I fell for him, but then I remember why we broke.This is why:1) He hit me twice.2)Called me a B.3)Flirted with a lot of other girls.4)Very disrespectful.And there's more crap to that, but those are the main reasons. Now like I was saying.Every time I'm with him I see why I fell for him, but then I remember why I broke up with him. ðŸ’”. Yes I broke up with him. But then when I see Truth all those feelings go away. I mean they just vanish. Sometimes it's so extreme where I even forget who Tj is. It's just Truth. Truth. Truth. Where's Tj?? I have no idea. So now I'm questioning why? Why does that happen?
