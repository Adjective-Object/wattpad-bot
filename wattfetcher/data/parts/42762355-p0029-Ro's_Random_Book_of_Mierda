Savonranta and Punkaharju have a close relationship. They do business together; Punkaharju sells the wood and Savonranta delivers it. The two seem to enjoy each other's company and try to spend as much time together as possible. Savonranta doesn't really like the fact that his younger brother looks older and is taller than him, so he often tries to pick up an argument about it, but Punkaharju only laughs. //Punkaranta is Admin's BROTP//

Kerim채ki: //cuddles Punkaharju// ^w^
Savonranta: Hn... //holding Punkaharju's hand//

Savonranta: Your mother was bootyfur when she was making you...
GODDAMNIT SAVONRANTA I SWEAR I WILL CUT YOUR DICK OFF D:<
Kerim채ki: ...don't touch my baby brother...
Okei, okei, I'll back off-- Jesus...
Kerim채ki: //snipes Ro// ^7^ Bitch

Kerim채ki: //cuddling the corpse//
