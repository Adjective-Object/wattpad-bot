I wake up on the floor in a mysterious place not remembering any of the previous things except that I got into a car accident.
I have a terrible migraine, a bloody scalp, and a couple of bloody scratches.
I try to get up off of the floor hurting all over, I can't really see much with the lights flickering on and off but I don't think I'm alone.
All of a sudden the lights shut all the way off, at this point I'm terrified and pinching myself to see if I wake up in my bed from a bad dream.
