I'm not like most girls at my school. Most of the girls are popular. And doesn't want to know what there going to do when they're older or get out of high school or they want to be some kind of cheerleader or dancer. But me no I'm much more different then that I want to be a singer well in a band. Oh forgot to mention my name is skylar. Skylar Edwards. Most people call me ski. Me and my friends are more of outcasts. I mean there people who are way more popular then there are those few people who have no friends. But still were weird. People think that the 5 of us are weird. Which u don't know how it's a bad thing. Well anyway my name is skylar. Most people call me ski like i said before. I'm in 8 grade and I'm about to move which freakin sucks i mean I've lived there for my whole life. Also you might be wondering why I have tattoos well here is the thing I lied to get it. How exactly well a lot of people say I look 18 so I said u was 18 you would've thought they would ask for someone's liscens.The good thing is that my 2 other best friends Ariana and Zoey are also moving .Also were moving to where I've always wanted to live. Los Angeles. It was a friday night and before I started texting Ariana and Zoey about us moving to l.A. Well there's nothing really exciting going on in my life right now. Besides the fact I'm moving to l.a which did I mention is 8 hours away.
