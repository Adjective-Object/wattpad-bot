the non-stop tick of the clock deafens my ears and leads me to believe that it is real.
the voices whisper me to do things that are against my beliefs but the oh-so-familiar tones lead me to believe that it is real.
mysterious bugs crawl on my legs and all over the wall cloud up my mind but the distinct feel of them leads me to believe that it is real.
ghosts pull at my hair and make me twitch but the itch that feels so right leads me to believe that it is real.
the doctors say i'm very ill, but they know nothing. it is all very real to me, how could it not be? i feel and hear and see these things, how could they not be real?
they try to shove pills down my throat and try to send me to unfamiliar 'treatment' centers, but i refuse because i am not insane like they say. all of these things are so real.
