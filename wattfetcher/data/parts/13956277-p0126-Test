The loud music was hitting our eardrums, "THIS PLACE IS COOL" Simon shouted through the loud music, "I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A PLACE LIKE THIS BEFORE" I told him as I was staring at people drinking like crazy and girls dirty dancing with  clothes that cover a bit more than bikinis, I wasn't quite comfortable, I was kind of afraid, "I DONT FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS" I shouted and Simonot barely heard me, "Don't worry, it's just because it's your first time" SimoNo was already shaking along with the beat, "NO, no, I think I should go home"
I turned my heels and was about to reach the door but I felt a hand on my waist, "Come on, it's my last day here, let's have fun ! You want to have fun and set yourself free!" Simon said in my ear as he pulled me by the waist to his chest, "But I'm leaving at 10:00" I said and he nodded.
Simon was dancing to the beat of 'I'm sexy and I know it' He was dancing like there was no tomorrow, he sang along with the song then pointed at me with his finger and said "You're sexy and you know it" I laughed at loud as I was standing still in my place and clapping for Simon, I was shy, because I've never gone farther than 'running' in public.
"Are you just going to keep watching me and clapping like an idiot? Show me what this slim waist can do, come on !" Simon pulled my hand and placed it in his, he put his other hand on my waist as a slow song came, we started moving slowly to the beat of it, "You know what?" Simon asked, "What?", "I'm the luckiest man" He smiled and his dimple became visible, "And may I know why?" I asked as I was staring at his beautiful eyes, "Because I have you" He said and pulled me closer to him, he rested his forehead on mine, and we shared a kiss that I wished to last forever.
"I should go home" I told Simon, "Fine, let me pay for the drinks first then we're out".
"I had fun" Simon said with a wide smirk on his face, "Good" I smiled, I wasn't very glad or even proud of what I've done, "What's wrong bae?" Put his hand on my thigh as I was driving to the hotel he was staying in, "Nothing, I'm just new to all of those things" I sighed, "Don't worry, you'll get used to it" He said as his hand went up and down my thigh, I slapped his hand away, "Don't cross the line" I said and he chuckled, "Fine" He said.
I stopped in front of the hotel he was staying in, "When is your flight?" I asked him, "It leaves at 3 am" He said sadly, "You better have some sleep then" I smiled, "You want to get rid of me, don't you?" He raised an eyebrow, "Of course not" I leaned closer to him and hissed his cheek, "You call that a kiss?" Sarcasm was obvious in his voice and I giggled, "I need to leave immediately" I checked my watch, "Okay, bye" He frowned, "Come on ! Don't be sad, I'll follow you in less than a week, I'll just have to convince Karam" I said and Simon surprisingly kissed my lips quickly and he laughed out loud, "Got it" He said then ran to the hotel "BYE" He shouted.
Full freedom isn't as fun as I thought, I mean ... what happens after clubbing, drinking and kissing? Nothing ..
Satan : No, darling there are many other fun things you can do ! You've just started flying, you didn't see the whole wold yet ! Be a little bit patient and don't change your  mind.
........
Two days later.
"Hello bae" Simon said through the phone, "Hi" I smiled, "Talked to Karam yet?", "No, didn't find the perfect time" I sighed, "Come on ! I can't stay here without you. I miss you" He faked crying, "Awh, can't live without me now?" I chuckled, "To be more specific, I can'tell live without your tasty lips. They're like drugs to me" He said in his deep voice, he got me melting between his words, "Shut up, don't make me crave you more than I already do. I'll talk to Karam immediately and tell you what happens. Love you" I said then hung up, my phone buzzed and I opened the message, it was from Simon : At least let me say that I love you too, before you shit the phone !.
