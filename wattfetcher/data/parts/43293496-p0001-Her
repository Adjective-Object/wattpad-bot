I really like writing from a man's point of view, but not more than from a woman's. I've already written The Secretary and finished it. So, I figured I'd write it again. From John's point of view. Aside from the fact that it gives another side to the story, I just feel like it will be interesting to write the person giving the orders, not taking them. Of course, Jack Nicholson is John Redford and Jessica Lange is Laurie King. This is my favorite series of books that I've written and the first one got more reads than I had anticipated. I hope you guys enjoy reading this and if you do, please vote! And give me feedback, comment, message, anything! I love hearing what you think of my stories... Of course, this has sadomasochism in it, which is something I've become oddly obsessed with writing about. No, I've never been involved with it, it's just crazy to write, a challenge, almost. Anyways, thanks for reading. :)
