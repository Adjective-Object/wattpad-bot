I totally had forgotten about my baby, my unborn child. Simon followed me, "Are you Okay ?" He asked worriedly, "Yes, I'm fine, it's just because I haven't eaten all day" I said when the rest followed but only me and Simon knew the true reason behind my pain.
"We have to go to the police station, they have the criminals and the girls. You're going to meet your sister again, and soon enough, you'll be able to hug your parents again" I told Nina's sister then we got in my car and I drove as fast as I could.
We reached and saw them unloading the girls from the truck and getting them inside the building, it was a joyful but hurtful moment for Damon, he saw his father being dragged by police men with his hands cuffed, "Don't worry man, he'll be fine" Simon patted Damon's back and he nodded, "You did the right thing, you should be proud of yourself" I smiled warmly at him.
"LEENA!" I turned my head around and saw Karam walking toward us furiously, "YOU LIED TO ME" He screamed. "I'll explain everything" Simon said,"NO, you just shut up" He pushed Simon back.
"Thank you Leena and Simon, you helped us to catch some of the filthiest criminals" The Minister said and Karam's jaw dropped, "I'll tell you everything later" I said.
"NINA!" Nina ran toward us and hugged her sister while tears of joy were falling from their eyes and pain was obvious in Damon's face, I gave him a warm smile, "But what am I going to tell my mother and sister ?" He asked, "The truth. Just tell them the truth" I sighed.

Weeks later, Most of the girls were sent back to their parents while the ones left were taken care of and safe in real orphanages, Damon and his family got back to the neighborhood, Tom, Simon and Molly were doing well and getting ready for their finals, and so was I, but I had another thing to get ready for ...
Schools' Karate championship....
I went through 6 matches and won all of them without sweating. But, the final match was different.
The competitor was tough, my hands and legs were aching, and I felt the need for surrendering. But NO. I ain't a quitter, "KICK HER, ON THE HEAD" Simon shouted, "NO, ON THE KNEE SO SHE'D FALL" Karam shouted and listened to him and the girl collapsed on the floor, Simon and Karam shouted and high-fived each others. They became good friends.
"AND THE WINNER IS ... LEENA AHMAAAAAAAAAAAAD" The judges said, the principal ran toward my while screaming in happiness and handed me the golden medal. Karam came and hugged me, "Your parents would be so proud of you if they were here" He said, a tear streamed down my face, "Come on ! Don't ruin the moment of victory ! MY CUPPYCAKE WON !" I laughed at Simon's words while Karam glared at him, "Congratulations" Diana, Hannah, Helen and Molly gave me a group-hug while Damon came with a bouquet with red flowers, Karam walked toward him and snatched it from his hands, he cat get rid of his jealous side, "Thank you Damon" I smiled.
"LENAAA" I looked around and saw Nina walking with her sister and their parents behind them, "Congratulations" She and her sister hugged me, "Hi, We are Mr and Mrs.West, we are here to thank you for bringing our daughters back, we can never pay you back no matter what we do" The woman said, "I didn't do all the work on my own, these hunks helped me in many things" I pointed at Simon and Damon, the man went toward them and thanked them too then that sweet family left.
"So, aren't we going to celebrate ?" Diana asked, "Oh, yes we are. Dinner is on me" Karam said.
