* * *This is a sequel to Forbidden Destiny. Forbidden Destiny is recommended to be read first. Note, if you do read this story first, you may not be able to enjoy Forbidden Destiny as there are major spoilers through this book. There will also be a memory lane, which means you'll be pretty confused when I mention anything from the past. Nevertheless, you may read this story, and I hope you enjoy it.
Deceased cats will not be mentioned in the Allegiance.
