"Ella you're going to be late for school!" Mary called
School. When can I leave that prison? Until I graduate, ugh!
I rolled out of bed and changing my ratty old pajamas.
Then making my way to the bathroom putting on some lip gloss and concealer. I'm too tired for makeup. I grabbed my book bag and briskly made my way downstairs. My sister already had breakfast ready. But Mary was too busy reading always had her nose in a book.
"Well you look beautiful!" she teased
How many times she says it I won't believe it. I'm pretty but not drop dead gorgeous I was ok I guess. I don't hate myself and I don't love myself either.
I am living with my sister now because our parents died a couple months ago, we need eachother if I didnt love her so much I'd be living with my bestfriend Danny.
I looked down at my watch realizing the time I grabbed my books, slipped on my shoes opening the door
"Bye Mary!" I called
"I love you! Don't be late!" she said as I closed the door
I ran over to the bus stop sitting on the bench. I watched traffic go on in front of me. I thought about all the work I have yet to finish and not just in school. I forgot about the bus up in front of me but who knows what goes on in Chicago!
