If you have a younger sibling, you will know exactly what i am talking about when i say this.
YOUNGER SIBLINGS ARE FREAKING ANNOYING
Even if you comment that they aren't, i will know you are lying. Because there is not a person on this planet that has a youbger sibling and has never gotten annoyed by them before.
My point is, my sister is annoying. Like, really annoying. And i was camping once, and when she came in the camper, she did this running jump shit onto the bed and my FRICKIN' ART SUPPLIES FLEW EVERYWHERE. i was pretty pissed off. And then SHE told mom that I had jumped on the bed and screwed up her paints. Like, DAFUQ BRUH.
