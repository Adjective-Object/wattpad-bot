I started talking to Shelby over the internet and that's when we started becoming best friends. We would Skype all the time and that's when we decided to see each other. She would visit almost every month and we would have laughs. We both just finish high school and got into the same college and that's when we decided to become roommates. Everything was going fine until she started coming home at weird times so I followed her and that one day I found her secret and I knew I was living with a crazy roommate.
