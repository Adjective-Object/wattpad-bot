"Good morning, I am your head master, I would like to welcome you to a new and improved Ivy Hills University," everyone cheered, "after the fire last year I decided to have a change the uni is better more technology, FREE WIFI and BETTER FOOD," everyone laughed and cheered, "now may we please bow our heads and have a moment of silence for the loved ones we have lost during the past year," everyone went quite,
"Gordon Rodgers 1957-2014 a wonderful teacher and loved one, Tyler James 1990-2012, a know it all student but kind, and will always be loved," ..... "Tony Harper 1995-2014, a loved student that was close to everyone's hearts, died in the fire of 2014," tears rolled down my cheeks, is it bad that I want mark to hold me and comfort me right now?
The moment of silence was over and we were getting put into are homerooms or form class, "Mrs dove's homeroom, room 299 the following students please follow her, as this will be your class for the rest of your school time here,"
"Emily Johnson, Rose Patterson, Daniel copper, Paul lent, Sophie timber, Mark Rider, Craig Moore, Poppy Hayes, Catherine Mallon, Anthony king, Olivia Cummings, Lance Callahan." We basically had most popular boys in our form class, for one there was Mark, lance, Anthony and Daniel then their was some slut Sophie with her gang poppy and Olivia, then a really pretty girl Catherine and some nerds.
"Oh my god," rose whispered to me, "just our luck right," I huffed, "Daniel seriously," she huffed as well, Daniel was her ex boyfriend
We fell behind, the Catherine girl was a couple of feet away, "Catherine is it?" She turned around and nodded "you can sit with us if you haven't got friends," I smiled at her, she smiled back
"Really?" "Of course," I smiled, "I'm Emily, this is rose," "nice to meet yous," "so that mark guys cute," my heart stopped and the couple prices left of my heart shatters at his name,
Rose stopped in her tracks, "um, did I say something?" "Not so cute when he cheats on you," my lips went in a straight line, she gasped, "oh my god, your the couple the "their live started as hate couple" I can't believe it," "well we aren't in love or a couple, but I do hate him," I smiled,
We arrived after everyone was settled down, my heels the only thing we could hear in the hallway, I swing into the room and scanned it, he didn't look, he kept his head down until I smiled and walked into the room and sat in the middle of the class, along with Catherine and rose.
"These seats are not assigned so seat where you want when you want," the voice of Mrs dove echoed in the room, "okay so we have new rules, and I will start if by telling you that this class have picked most of the same subjects," "so that means yous will be in the same classes, English, maths, science, and geography are the subjects you have all picked the same, two of yous have picked health, three of yous have picked sports studies and two of you have picked photography, the others are either cheerleading or the school year book," "mark and Emily, you both have health,"
What no, nope, no, rise turned to me with a sort look, "rose and Daniel and Anthony sports studies," I looked at her with sorry eyes, but amusement because I couldn't believe are ex's had the same classes it's almost as if they new, or was it just fate nah, "Catherine and lance yous are photography," we smiled at her she was lucky being new here.
"First period is English," I got up the sound of my chair scraping along the floor, I was the first to get up and my heels click clacked along the floor as I got out of the class room, can't wait for are little talk daddy.
