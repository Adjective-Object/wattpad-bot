''At dock 10'' says Micro with a new smile on his face
''Go to the docks and do as you were told, we will be there to back you up''
''Thank you Star your parents would be proud'' says Micro
I grimace I hate people mentioning my folks.Hen and I turn around and head towards dock 10.Hen whispers to me when were walking:
''Good job and you know they really would be proud of you''
''I don't care Hen lets just get to the docks, get Micro's family,and get the Hell off this planet Ok''
''Ok but still nice job''
''Thanks''
I felt something in my chest that hasn't been there in a long time....joy
