Slap!
There was a red mark on the left side of Oliver's face. You looked at your hand which had a small stinging pain to it. You trembled in fear. Oliver felt his cheek with his hand and whimpered. Tears started to form in his eyes but he quickly blinked them back. You pulled your hand back to your chest and looked at him with fear.
'Oh gawd. What have I done?'
"(F/n), dearie? You'll pay for that, you little clutz..." He growled. More pink formed in his eyes. You wished that you hadn't done that. Now you were silently praying he won't do anything to you.
"O-oliver... I'm s-sorry, I didn't m-mean to..." You whimpered biting your bottom lip. A little too hard that a small amount of blood bled.
Oliver growled again and licked your bottom lip drinking the blood. You shivered.
"As much as I love you, (F/n)..." Oliver whispered on your lips. "I can't just leave you unpunished."
"W-wha-? What do you mean?" You stuttered. Oliver grabbed you by the arm and hoisted you up. You winced a the pain when held your arm tight. You heard Oliver giggle.
"Oh~ you'll find out soon, poppet~!" He hummed as he dragged you. "But first..." He added.
You looked at him a bit scared. He covered your mouth with white handkerchief. You gasped at it, but once you inhaled the smell, your eyes felt heavy. Everything seemed to be blurred out. The last thing you saw before you closed your eyes, were a pair of electric blue eyes with little specks of pink.
Black...

You slowly opened your eyes. They still felt heavy. But you forced yourself to fully open them. Instantly, bright light blinded you. You squinted your (E/c) eyes and shaded them by lifting up your hand. You looked around you.
You were in a bed that had frilly, lacy, blankets and covers that were pretty dirty. You looked outside the window, it was draped inÂ  frilly, dirty white curtains and the walls surrounding you were runned down wood. It was dark and creepy.
'Where am I?'
You shifted a bit, when you heard a moan and an arm wrapped tighter around your waist. Your eyes widened a bit. You looked down and saw a figure sleeping peacefully.
He had strawberry blonde hair, freckles on his face and down his arms. Oliver. He was shirtless and his slightly muscular arms were wrapped tightly around you.
'For a guy who looks scrawny on the outside, he's pretty strong...'
Oliver's eyes fluttered open and had a natural pout on his face.
'Cute... Wait, what?'
You mentally slapped yourself. He yawned and stared into space. His eyes looked up at yours.
"Awake already, poppet~?" Oliver mumbled shuffling a bit. He moved up and buried his nose on the crook of your neck. You blushed as his hot breath tickled your skin.
You looked down at him again. Oliver's eyes closed, and he was drifting off like he was a few minutes ago. You blushed at his sleeping form. He looked really cute if you looked close enough.
