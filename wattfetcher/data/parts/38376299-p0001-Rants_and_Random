Welp yesterday was suppose to be my Birthday party,BUT THE STUPID RAIN CANCELED IT. I was bummed out,but my crazy,calm,and sort of like me,friend came over =P Her Wattpad account it @_hattu and yeh =3 The best thing about yesterday is she gave me A PIERCE THE VIEL SHIRT,EYELASH CURLER,AND CHOCOLATE! Not only that she taught me how to ride a skateboard! I'm better with a longboard and kept bugging her to use it instead of mine xDD
OHHHHHHHHHHHH
We found a turtle ðŸ˜± We were in the neighborhood flower garden and I saw something move and I'm saying this extremely fast:
"Jaydan,Jaydan,Jaydan I see something moving. Jaydan I'll be right back!"*Runs to moving object and I realize it's a turtle*
"ER MER GERD ITS A TURTLE!"
"Oh it is!"*Says as she runs behind me*
We took a selfie with the turtle and I kept hogging the poor thing xD Then we took a video and released it into the buoy =3
The picture above shows me and mah skateboard,I was sitting down while taking this picture xD
Random: I think knee pads are better looking than elbow pads. . .just saying.
Song of the day: Pierce the Viel: Tangled In The Great Escape
