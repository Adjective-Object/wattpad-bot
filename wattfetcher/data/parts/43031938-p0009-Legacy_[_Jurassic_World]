"Owen.." Keira said softly. "It's just a visit. We'll just listen to what he has to say and if we don't like it, it ends there. Okay?"
Owen looked at her to protest but thought against it. "Alright."

"Is Dad okay?" Theo asked that evening as he sat beside his mother on the Bungalow's back porch. "He went to bed awfully early."
"He's fine. Just a bit cranky. You know how he gets about people coming to the island." Keira told him.
"But why? It's been forever since something bad has happened here." Theo said.
"Well, sometimes bad events can leave a lasting effect. You know, it took your grandfather over twenty two years before he set foot back on this island. Your father and I have had our own bad experiences on this island and he has every right to be cautious. "
Theo just sat there. "Don't worry about him. He'll be better tomorrow."
"You think so, with the president here?"
"After the president leaves." she smiled before kissing his forehead. Theo smiled before resting into his mother's side.
"Seeing those babies hatch today reminded me of the day you were born." she told him.
"Ma." he groaned.
"Oh stop. It's a beautiful thing." Keira said.

"Okay, all you have to do is breathe in and out. In and out. In and out." Owen said holding her hand as she was on the bed preparing to give birth.
She looked at him. "Owen, darling?"
"Yes?"
"Stop it." she said.
"Right. I'm just gonna be right here. Being quiet. You won't even know I'm here. I'll be that quiet. I-"
"Owen!" she laughed.
"Oh yeah."
Keira had been accidentally stepped on by young dinosaurs, trampled by triceratops, struck into a tree by an Apatosaurus, and stabbed in the leg, but in that moment nothing compared to the pain she was in as the doctor gave her orders to push. Owen remained true to his word staying by her side only offering a couple words of encouragement.
After what seemed to be forever, they were greeted by a cry.
"Oh thank god." Keira said resting back in exhaustion.
"Here he is. Your son."
Owen held onto the baby first. "He looks just like his ol' man."he said proudly before cooing at the baby.
"How could you even tell?" she chortled.
"Easy. Every Grady man is handsome." he held up his son's face to his. "See?"
Keira smiled as Owen walked over with the blanketed baby in his arms.
"We're parents!" Owen cheered gleefully.
"Sssh." Keira said with a smile. "He's asleep already."

"You were such a quiet baby." she said. Theo blushed.
"So smart too. As you got older we had to keep a special eye on you, climbing out of your crib, stacking things and climbing all over the place." she chuckled. "You're growing up too fast on me!" she said shaking him playfully.
