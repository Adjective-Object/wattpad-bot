"Really?"
"You didn't know?"
"Does this look like a face of someone who knows stuff?"
He studied my face for a second before replying. "Your right. You look like you know nothing."
I scoffed and smacked his arm, causing him to laugh.
"Pleeeease take your shirt off?" I batted my eyelashes innocently.
"That's not fair! You're using your begging face!"
I smiled at him, and tilted my head lightly. "Please?"
He rolled his eyes and pulled the grey shirt off.
I clapped my hands together and smiled more.
Paul chuckled at me, seeing as I was acting like a five year old. I nuzzled into him, trying to take in his body warmth.
"Little spoon or big spoon?" He asked, quietly, as if I was already asleep and he didn't want to wake me.
"Little spoon of course." I smiled. I kissed his lips gently and then switched my position so my back was against his warm chest.
He wrapped his arms around my stomach and kissed the place where my neck ended.
Paul nuzzled his cheek against my shoulder. When he spoke, his breath tickled my neck.
"I love you."
"I love you too."A/N: CHEESY CHAPTER I KNOW AND I AM NOT SORRY.
