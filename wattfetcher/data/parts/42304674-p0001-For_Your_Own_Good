"Luna, mom said come downstairs, Now!" Dillion, my youngest sibling says. "Tell her I will come downstairs when she stops having kids," I grumble. "I heard that! Get your butt down here Luna!" My mom shouts. "Never! The only way I will come down there is if Cam drags me downstairs!" I argue. Cameron(Cam), my older sister then barges into my room. "You brought this upon yourself," she says and drags me downstairs and into the kitchen to face my depressed mother.
"Look at me right now!" My mom spits. I stand up and look her in the eyes. "I know you hate this, but change is good," she says. Tears threaten to spill out of my eyes, but I refuse to act this way in front of everyone. If I fall apart , the entire family will crash into oblivion. "Now go get ready. Colorado springs is 69 miles away from Denver. I love you. Please remember I do this because I love you," mom says while Samuel, my twin brother, loads my luggage into my 1960s, fully restored, white Cadillac with fins.
After driving for an hour and ten minutes I pull into the schools parking deck. As I unload my luggage onto a cart I bump into someone. "Oh, sorry," I apologize. "It's alright. Would you like some help?" The person asks.
A/N: yep. Left you with a cliff hanger. Please comment, but be kind and no arguing. If so i will have to ask you to stop.
