We left my house and Chase drove us back to the track - which was a good hour and a half of a drive. We didn't talk much, Chase just had the radio on quietly playing, every now and then he'd switch from today's hits to a country station and sing along softly. I started dozing off about an hour into the drive. "Taylor," he whispered. "Don't fall asleep yet.""Why?" I said half asleep then I slowly opened one eye. He pouted, "I didn't even get a good night kiss."I was leaning against the passenger door so I sat up leaned over to him and gave a quick peck on the lips. "That's it?" He asked as leaned back into the passenger side door area."For now."
I woke up to Chase laying me on his bed. "Wait, you carried me in here?" I asked groggily. He smiled and blushed a little bit, "Yeah," then he stuck out his tounge like a six year old, "I was being a gentleman and carried you like a bride you will be one day." Then he kissed my cheek and walked into the bathroom. I was still waking up when he came out of the bathroom a few minutes later but now in navy blue cotton sweatpants and white ankle socks. Yeah and a sweatshirt- sadly. "Bathroom is all yours princess."I smiled, "Princess?""Yeah, you're a princess to me." He walked over to me as got up of his bed. Then he whispered in my ear, "You had no idea how much I had to be a gentleman when taking you out of the car and bringing you in my room while you are wearing a dress.""Wow." I playfully pushed him away. "Such a teenage boy!" I said shaking my head and walking out of the bed room and towards the bathroom.
