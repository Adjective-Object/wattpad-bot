"Stop these gentle moves because I'll never like you .. NEVER"
"I'll try my best" he said, I glanced atÂ him then we went home silently....

Two days passed, but believe me it wasn't that easy with Damon trying to break into my room to see me without hijab, and flirting with me all the time, then there's Jake
"Come On I don't want to be punished for being late because of you AGAIN" Elina said
I put On my Red hijab, Dark blue shirt And Red maxi skirt before I went out .
"Wait for meeeee" Damon said behind us
"oh god" I gasped
"So Leena, What do you think about the school" He tried to talk to me
"It'd be perfect if you and jake stop annoying me" his face broke after I said that, I chuckled a bit, I was rude but I had to, Or else he'll think that I like him.
"I-I forgot something, I need to get back to get it" Damon left us because he probably felt stupid or something.
.......
"Hey" A manly voice said .
"Hello" Elina said and I felt her warm hand leaving mine so I left my eyes up to look for her, and I wish I didn't
I found her In a guy's arms hugging and kissing
"WHAT THE HELL ELINA" I pulled her back
"What's wrong with you" The guy glared at me
"Leena calm down he's my boyfriend" she explained
"That doesn't make it look any better, that's haraam"
"Leena, I really appreciate your advice, but remember that we have different beliefs and religions" she smiled but I got upset
"Whatever" I left them and walked to my locker
"Mammammeyaaaa Only if that skirt was shorter and that hair was showed" Someone said behind me, I heard his footsteps, he was getting closer and closer to me.
"so you're the hot new modest girl that every other girl is jealous of ? believe me, they got many reasons to" The guy said, I ignored him and closed my locker
"Hey Tom" Damon said, So his name was Tom? great ! Damon,Jake,And Tom ... Who's coming next ?
"Wait a second Damon, can't you see that I'm busy" Tom said, I left them and entered the bathroom.
There were three girls there, who were beautiful but had pretty much make up on
"Assalaamu 'Alaykom" I said
"Look who's here, The Arabian chick" one of them said, I raised my eyebrows in surprise.
"Don't be surprised, That's what the boys call you, and It's not too hard to recognize you since you're the only covered girl in the school " she said.
"well, I'm Leena Ahmed" I smiled
"Ashley, Diana, And Molly" they smiled
"So what's going on with you and Jake" Molly asked, Ashley pinched her arm.
"Me and Jake? since when did we have something going On" I raised an eyebrow then I untied my hijaab to wrap it around my head again because my hair was slipping out of it.
