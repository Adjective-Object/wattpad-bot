I'm sorry that's I've been posting all this sad and depressing shit but it's all gotta come out. Everyone that's reading this and knows me... they all know I love Markiplier. I love that man to death and my dream has been to meet my hero... sadly I'm broke. I can't go see him but I can love him no matter what. I just... I saw his reaction video and just like him it's all just water works. I've been crying just thinking and seeing how many people around the world love this man. Markiplier is more like a dad to all of us. In pretty sure that by then end of this week only a few people would have agreed with me but I don't care. Mark will probably never read this but here it goes. I love you Mark. For being you, For being a father to me even if you didn't notice. Thank you Markimoo. We, the fans all around the world will never stop loving you. and if you do get this one day... we'll I hope you understand how we feel. Even if sadly your father wasn't with you for most of your life you've acted like a father to millions. Some kids that don't even have fathers can go ahead and call you daddy cause that what you are. A father. We know you can't love us all but just loving a few... that makes an impact. Mark you've sparked something in people, something the thought didn't exist, like me. Joy. That's all it took Mark. We will always love you.
