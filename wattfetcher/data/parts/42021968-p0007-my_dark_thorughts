Why do you push me to this to scrach to cut  pierce  my skin you give me the blade all I can hear is your voice your werthles useless a pile of shi* you try to push the blade onto my wrist you cut deeper and deeper with each world you say you say we won't stop till your dead gone no longer here perished dead covers in cuts. I whant to stop these cuts the bloody  pain I go through  the tears that are shed the words that are said I whant these  well everything can anyone hear me is scream  and shout with a gun to my head  I ask my self why why   do I stay why can't  I die why do I have to continue  to cry to hurt my self why can't I just DIE.
