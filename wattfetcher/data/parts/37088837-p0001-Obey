Briiiing! Briiiing! Briiiing!
I threw my alarm clock across the room.
Dammit that was the thirtieth one this month and school only starts today!
I took a shower and wore my black skinny jeans, a black vest, a black leather jacket and black combat boots.
I combed through my quiff with my fingers to give it a messy look. Did I mention I look like a dude.
I have hair nearly like Zayn Malik but mine is a bit shorter, has dark red highlights and is blue black.
My eyes are a bright ocean green- blue. My of features are sharp and defined yet still very gentle.
My skin is a a light caramel. My mom is Puerto Rican (Spanish speaking) my dad was black.
After getting ready I got a call from my mom.
"Hello mama."
"Hola Alexis. How are you?"
"Great and you."
"Wonderful. You really should have come with John and I. It is great in England."
"Mama you know I don't like that man!"
"So you would rather live alone, go to school and work when you could move in with us or even accept some money from him?"
"Yes."
"Why?"
"He is not-"
"Your father. I get it!"
"Alexis. Please dear, I worry about you!"
"I know ma."
"You are my only child."
"Yeah."
"John wants to speak to you."
"No ma-"
"Alexis! Hello."
"The name is Alex."
"Right. I'm sorry. How are you?"
"What do you want?"
"I want you to come here to your mother and I."
"I'm going to school now. Bye."
I quickly hung up.
Can't have a day of peace in this damned world.
I hopped on my black 1997 Harley that my father gave me before he went to Afghanistan.
I sped off to school with my father in my mind.
(AN: She looks like Brenda Song but with a quiff and different colour eyes.)
