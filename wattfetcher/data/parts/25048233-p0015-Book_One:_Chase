Three hours passed by so fast that it was already time for the party. Everyone was fully prepared, except me of course. I’m still wearing my school uniform – you know, the usual white polo and blue shorts. I don’t care. I just have to sign the attendance thingy anyway.
“Yo, Chase!” Art approached me as I sign the attendance sheet. He was wearing black long-sleeves under a white coat that is being complemented by his gray bowtie. Damn, he looks good!  Wait, what am I thinking? Geez.
“Hey…” I don’t know how to greet him. It’s still pretty awkward, you know.
“Glad you made it! This party’s pretty boring without you.”
“Uh… What made you say that? I don’t bring anything interesting with me.”
“Well, that’s what you think. Coming here in a school uniform is really interesting.” Art gave me a wide smile.
“Oh that? I just came here to sign the attendance sheet. I’m leaving soon.”
“Wieh. Why? Can’t you stay? For me?”
“I-I d-don’t really like p-parties.” I started stuttering. Looking at him while he’s doing this ‘pitiful’ look is giving me a weird feeling.
“Aw, come on! Please? Pretty please?”
“Chase! You’re here!” Before I can say anything to Art, Ice interrupted. Great timing! Wait, no! Shit. Why now? Art stopped making this “puppy” face and looked at Ice. I can tell that the very presence of Ice upset him. His eyes are rolling with disbelief.
“Yeah. I have to go now.” I need to escape this situation. I can’t handle this awkwardness.
“No, no. S-stay. Uhm… Right! The principal needs to see you! This instant.” I can’t help but feel that I’m being set-up again.
“Hey Ice, Chase wants to go home now. Just let him be.” Art grabbed Ice’s hand. I can feel the tension building up! I have to do something.
In the end, I decided to go with Ice. I can’t do much anyway – he’s the Student Council President.
“I’m pretty sure you’re just making things up Ice. But if that’s what makes you happy, then I will talk to the principal. Then, I can go home… in peace.” I then faced Art. “Sorry Art. I’ll go with Ice to see the principal.”
“O-okay.” Art said sadly.
We searched everywhere for the principal and found him at the Bar Section. He was drowning in all the alcohol that was there. He was pretty much enjoying the party. This old bastard loves to drink and he’s using this party as an excuse.
“Hey Principal Kraisingha! Can you hear me?”
“Whaaaat? I can’t hear you with all the noise in the background!” He opened another bottle of wine and started drinking it.
“You told me you wanna’ see Chase.’”
“Huh? I wanted to see Chase?” The principal gave Ice a confused look.
“Y-yes! You told me you wanna’ have a drink with him.” What the fuck? This guy is gonna’ make me drunk! I knew it! I freaking knew it!
“Oh yeah. I remember now! Chase, here you go. Have a little of this.” He opened another bottle and gave it to me. Oh god, it smells awful. I wanted to throw-up just having a sniff of it!
“Go ahead Chase, you don’t want to be rude to the principal do you?”
