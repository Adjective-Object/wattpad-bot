Italy nodded slowly. "I was supposed to get out, but I felt too hopeless. I just wandered around without knowing what to do, and before I knew it, I was in the library." he then opened his uniform jacket and took out an old looking book for everyone to see. "That's when I found this book."


"That's the Bible you've been carrying all along, isn't it?" China said, pointing at the book the Italian held.


Italy nodded and looked at the book. "Yeah, it kind of looks like a Bible, but this is actually a journal.


When I opened it, it had the name of its previous owner written on it." he then opened the journal and flipped it to a certain page.


"It reads 'Ryuuzu no Ko', right?" Japan said as he peered over to see the book.


Italy nodded again and continued, "Everyone had died right before my eyes, and I was all alone.


By then, I wasn't really thinking straight any more. That's where my memories get a little fuzzy.


I was going to throw this book away, too. But

... that monster found me, and I unconsciously ran away with the book still in my hands, and at last

... I got out.



I was alone..."

{flashback about the time Italy successfully escaped the mansion on his own}


Italy ran out of the front door and looked at his surroundings with wide eyes.


"I got out...


I'm the only one who survived, the only one who got out...


I shouldn't have been able to get out...


What the hell? This doesn't make any sense. Out of everyone, I'm the only one left?


What the hell? What the hell?" he yelled out in a frustrated tone.
