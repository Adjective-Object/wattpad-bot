Well, my two cats have recently been renamed to Romeo and Juliet. The reason is Jazzi has recently began her heat. So we are having to keep the two love birds away from each other. So I went upstairs to go into my room to get my laptop and there was Smokey with his paw under the crack of the door and I seen Jazzi's shadow on the other side of the door. So I was like-because I talk to cats- Now Romeo you have to stay away from Juliet. And my brother came to go down stairs and was like we should name them that for the time being. So that's their names until we get them neutered and spade then it goes back to Smokey and Jazzi.
