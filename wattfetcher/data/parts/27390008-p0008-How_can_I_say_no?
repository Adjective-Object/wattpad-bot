Samantha woke up the next morning to a loud bang. She bolted upright in the bed and looked around. She started laughing when she saw johnny on the floor. He groaned as he got up.
"Cut out your laughing. It's not funny. That actually hurt." Johnny said. He looked up at Samantha as he rubbed the back of his head. Samantha covered her mouth to try to stop laughing. She got up and knelt down next to him.
"Sorry. But this is not what I expected to see at all. I expected to see the door open or something. You know like in mortdecai when he was trying to talk to Johanna? Not this at all." Samantha giggled. Johnny shook his head.
"You had to be 16 when that came out. When did you see that?" He asked. Johnny pulled himself into a sitting position. Samantha blushed.
"Uh the day after it came out. With my parents I might add." Samantha replied. Johnny smiled.
"Interesting. Anyway we don't have anything to do today so what do you want to do?" Johnny asked. Samantha shrugged.
"Whatever. I don't really care. Just as long as I get to see more of London today." She replied. Johnny nodded. He focused on her eyes. 'Eyes that shine like the ocean.' He thought. Samantha blushed under his gaze.
"I hope you don't think me too rash. But I was wondering if......." johnny suddenly got enough nerve to ask her out. He thought he had to try even if she didn't like him. Without thinking, johnny leaned in and pressed his lips to hers. Samantha's eyes widened and the closed. Johnny pulled away.
"I'm so sorry. I wasn't thinking and I just....." He started.
"Johnny? Don't worry. Johnny....." Samantha said. He wouldn't stop apologizing so she kissed him. When she pulled away, johnny was shocked. He stared at her as she opened her  eyes. They sat there smiling at each other.
