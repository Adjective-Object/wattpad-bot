I was flying. My wings were a glorious white and my legs were tucked under my body. The feel of the air against my face was wonderful and and my golden hair was dancing in the wind. I could go one like this forever. Suddenly I hear a strange noise. A faint calling. "Um wake up its time for school." I W's beyond confused. What is this thing he called 'School'. I shook my head. I must be dreaming.  Wait a minute I am dreaming,  this is my dream, which means.....Oh No.
I woke up with a scream. "SCHOOOOL!" Oh my Allah.  How can I forget about school. Beads of sweat lined my forehead.  I snapped my head to my alarm  clock. I wish I hadn't because the clock read 10:00 am. Oh I am so dead. I was late 4times last week.
Groaning to myself I dragged my body to the bathroom and had my shower. I took my time getting dressed. Well hey seeing that I'm already late I might as well be more late. I pulled on some black pants and a white blouse. I topped it with a black blazer and black wedges. I pulled on a black scarf and lightly applied my make up. I went for a more sophisticated look today with blood red lipstick and black rimmed round sunglasses.  Damn.  Gotta say that I looked fiiiine.  When I was satisfied with my look I hopped out the house and drove to school. Ok this is it. I had never dressed like this before it was always an abayya but today was time for a change.
I held my head high and walked into the school. The corridors were empty and you could here the chatter of the students in the classrooms. I looked at my timetable and gulped. Oh no. Chemistry.  Why ya Allah.  I stood outside the door and peered inside.  They were doing an experiment. If I walked in right now everyone would stare.
Before I changed my mind I opened the door and marched right in. My face going blank in an instant.  Everyone stared. The silence was deafening.  My straight model face never waverd.  I cleared my throat"Sorry I'm late sir" I said looking into Mr Lyntons face. Even my voice had no tone. He looked me up and down and said
"what us your name, are you sure your in the right classroom? ".
I silently laugh to myself.
"Umamah Zakariyah sir".
Wow were is the camera when you need one eh? His face was priceless.  "Umamah why are you so late." Finally found your voice, took you long enough.
"Um sorry sir I had a.....doctors appointment. "
yeah yeah I know it's lame but it's all I could think off. "Ok Umamah whatever You're dismissed go to your next lesson don't he late." I smiled. And marched straight out the door and bumped into a hard chest.
"What the f***" a voice shouted.  My head hurt and my hijab was ruined.  I was ready to kill something.  It took me so long fixing my scarf in the morning and this moron just ruined my hard work. "Seriously idiot watch where your going" I spat out.
I looked up to drown in the most beautiful beautiful hazel eyes I have ever laid eyes on. His face should be illegal.  That's how beautiful and handsome he was.  Oh my Allah.  It's Haadi Yusef. I snapped out of my trance and pushed past him and ran to my car and drove home.  As soon as my feet cane I  contact with our wood floor I begged my btother Ashraf to call in sick for me. Supprisngly he agreed on one occasion.  I be his slave for a month. Not thinking about the consequences I blindly agreed and instantly regretted it once I saw an evil smirk spread across his face.  Turning my head I sprinted to my room and jumped into my bed and fell into a deep sleep.
