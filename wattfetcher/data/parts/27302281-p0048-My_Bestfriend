god I love you" justin whispered
"   I love you too"  I whispered
Then  my phone rang
Unknown  popped across the screen
Hello I said
Hello  kylie ....
Who is this
Its doesn't matter
What do u want
I want you to stay away from  justin he's mine okay he going to get bored of you and leave you its pathetic if you ask me I mean your not even that pretty u don't deserve justin I do and he will realize that and come crawling back to me
Tears threated to spill from my eyes   as I was about to say something the line went dead
I just stared at my phone then grabbed my car keys  and had tears  which made it hard to see but I didn't care  I needed out of here some fresh air   I  set my phone down on the counter and  grabbed my phone and ran out the door and climbed in the  drivers seat and drove off  and  I picked up speed and flew around corners and was going very fast but I don't care I needed my mom or at least  alone time
Then  the words flew through my headI mean your not even that pretty u don't deserve justin I do and he will realize that and come crawling back to me
Then I squinted the tears away  and wiped my face with the back of my hand  and makes a quick turn unto a side road and I just kept going
Justin POV
I saw kylie fly out of here I have to see if she's okay    who ever was on that phone offensively upset her  she shouldn't be driving   I got it I'll call her to check on her I thought pulling out my phone and  dialing her cell phone number
Ring ring
Kylie plz answer I said to my self then I heard. A phone ring across the room then my heart dropped my baby is out there upset driving with out her phone    my baby I said pacing back and forth   so I started calling people from her contacts asking if they had seen her and so far no one knew  where she was but they were keeping an eye out
Kylie POV
I was  made a wide turn  and wiped the tears out my eyes and then I looked up and screamed as I swerved  out the way of a car coming start for me and I turned my head to look back at the car that amost got me killed and I breathed   deeply as my heart beat  slowed down then I turned around facing the road and  bright lights shined in my car and  it was over before   i could respond then everything went black
