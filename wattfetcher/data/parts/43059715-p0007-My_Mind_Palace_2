Tardis walked up to the carnival attraction and raised an eyebrow. A small girl was sitting on a platform above a tub of water. She grabbed a beanbag and aimed for the target that would dunk-an-Ambay.
It missed by an inch. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Ambay fiddling with her thumbs. She knew she was about to get soaked.
Tardis flung the small beanbag and hit the target smack-dab in the middle. The platform immediately ejected and Ambay was plunged into the case of water.
She smiled in her success as a lid rose and covered the box. Ambay banged on the sides of the case in the hope she could shatter the glass, but to no avail.
Tardis curtsied and turned, walking away.
