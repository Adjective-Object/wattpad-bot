Y/n's POVI wake up in a dark room, I am tied up and have duct tape over my mouth. 'Who would do this to me I haven't done anything to anyone!' Was the thought that ran through my head, some person walks in but I cant see their face... they had a mask on... one word fucking creepy. "Soo who are you.." they ask, male voice. "Oops!" He ripped off the tape "ow you mother fucker!!" I yell at him "excuse me?!" He yells "you heard me fucker!" back mouthing earns me a loud and hard slap to my face "dont talk back bitch unless I ask a question!" He yells he walks around me like a shark ready to strike, making my heart pound faster. "You're really pretty..." he strokes my cheek I bite his finger "oww! You bitch!" another hard slap to my face. I tasted blood "who are you?" I ask "well that wouldn't be smart to tell. Would it?" Another man walks in through the door "Hey, she's awake!" The other man says, he has a mask on too. The other man walks closer, but the other stops him "nuh-uh I called dibs" he says "wh-what do you mean?" I ask "you'll see!" He laughs coming closer "no, no! I dont wanna know!" He rips off my tee and stares at me in my undergarment "stop you dick!" I yell of course another slap to my face feeling the sting of it my heart pounds even more "Shut up!" He just stares at my bra "look how nice it looks he steps out of the way to show his friend/partner. He laughs a deep and mumbley one.
