SO I WAS READING MY SIMS (NOT THE REALLY POPULAR ONE BUT THIS REALLY CUTE ONE THAT I LOVE) CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS

SO MY FAVORITE WAS GOTH BOY
(LITERALLY HIS NAME)
HIS DESCRIPTION:
A goth. He loves darkness and despair, as well as "Writing bad poetry"

DO YOU KNOW HOW STEREOTYPICAL THAT IS
I LAUGHED AT THAT DESCRIPTION SO NOW HE IS MY FAVORITE
