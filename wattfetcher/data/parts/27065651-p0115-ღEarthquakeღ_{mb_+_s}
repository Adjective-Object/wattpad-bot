Pink Floyd is really making me rethink my entire life and my life choices and who my friends are and what company I should keep. It makes me angry, cry, happy, it lulls me to sleep. My dreams and strange, but pleasant to say the least.
It's not just another brick in the wall. It's one of my turns, or the happiest days of our lives.
So goodbye blue sky and goodbye cruel world. I'm on the thin ice, leaving empty spaces and young lust.
