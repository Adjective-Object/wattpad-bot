I didn't have his number, never saw him around, and had no way to keep up with my thoughts. I was in love. I had fallen for someone I knew was not a stranger.
The whole summer, I went to sleep and saw him in my dreams. Some nights I would stay up and try I get him of my mind before I completely went insane. I know it's kind of awkward and/or weird because me and him hardly ever talked and I knew if he knew I thought about him this much, he would be completely afraid of me. Well not exactly afraid but at least creeped out.
Around July 12th each year, I head to North Carolina with family for a week for a reunion. To be honest, that was the only week I kept my mind clear of boys and most importantly, Justin. I stayed up till midnight each night and talked on the phone with my best friend Nicole and her brother Owen. Me, Nicole, and Owen became close and they took my mind off of everything that usually pollutes my mind in the summer. The bad thing was me and Owen used to be in a relationship so whenever I hang out with Nicole and him, I always remember me and his memories like the nights me and him took his dog for a walk and we would spend an hour just holding hands and talking. And at the end of that summer, we grew apart and never felt that way again.
When I came back from my vacation, I spent the rest of the summer with Nicole and Owen. We seemed to stay up late, drink and act like complete idiots. we would run through the streets and having fun.
That seemed to be the summer of forgetting. I finally went back to the old me when it was September 1st, the day before 7th grade started. All the forgotten thoughts of Justin came back and the thoughts overwhelmed me and I sat in bed till at least 2 am crying for some unknown reason. My thought seemed to take over.
The next day, I was even more overwhelmed.
