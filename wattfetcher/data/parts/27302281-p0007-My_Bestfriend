She looked so  into the movies then  when I scary part came on she hid in my chest and I just smiled and patted her back then her eyes looked into mine and a smile formed on her face   and then returned to the TV screen , I should try and tell her now   or should I,  yes I should
" listen Kylie I ...umm need to .."  I started to say  but she cut me off by saying
" shhh Justin the movies still on   you can tell me later "
This is getting annoying
" Kylie" I whined
" shhhh" she said
" Kylie"  I said annoyed
" Justin " she said even more annoyed
"  I know where Thayer was " I said
" where" she said looking  worried
" with my girlfriend  Blair " I said tearing up a bit
" Justin she's dumb  if  she cheated on a guy like you any girl would be lucky to have  you" she said
" what about you " he said hopeful
" Justin..."   I said shocked
" Kylie will you be my  girlfriend "  I said scratching the back of my neck
Kylie POV
Justin just asked me out OMG I have liked him since like the third grade  I can't believe this is finally happening    he likes me   he likes me  yayy   what should I say I could tell he was nervous cause he kept scratching the back of his neck and he sorta just stood there waiting for my answer should I say yes  I'm gonna say yes OMG
" yes " I said smiling
" really " he said  I laughed when his eyes lit up and then he hugged me OK I guess he's just as happy as me
" Kylie I promise  I will never hurt you and you won't regret giving me this chance thank you thank you " he said happily
This day couldn't get no better  I thought just as I said that Justin said
" there's something I have been dying to do since we met  " he said cupping my cheeks
" and what would that be" I smiled
" this " he said leaning in
I could smell his  hot mint breath against my fore head as he rested his head on mine " can I " he ask  politely
" of course " I said cupping his cheeks and I smiled as he  brought his  soft lips to mine
I smiled through the kiss and I could tell he did too we pulled away and just kept on smiling
When I said nothing could make this day better I was wrong he just made it betterI thought wrapping my arms around his neck and leaned in again and pecked him on the lips and pulled away
" wanna watch another movie " he said   still smiling
" yes  but I want a drink " I said getting up and walking into the kitchen  and he picked out  a movie and put it in .
