"When people fall in love they might feel happiness and joy. Some describe it as "butterflies" or a "zoo" in your stomach. I have never fallen in love. But, they say it can be the best and worst thing that ever happened to you. The best because; you get attached to the person and they start to be a part of you. The worst because; once they are a part of you, you don't want them to leave. And when they leave, it will destroy you eternally. It would feel like a stab in the back or an open wound.
Again, I have never fallen in love, but I know watching someone you care about leave, hurts."
~ Tatiana C. R. F. (aka me)
I really liked this because this quote or semi paragraph is from an english homework actually. They told to me "write about the feelings, emotions, etc, people might feel when they first fall in love". And this was my answer :)
