Okay so  on my way to San Francisco and they plane gets delayed. We have to go all the way to another gate and wait half an hour for that plane to come. Then we get on the plane and sit for 2 hours and then something happens to that plane and we have to get off.
Now they're saying that they're gonna try and get us another plane. But they're a a chance that we might now get another one. WTF?!
I'm so mad.
