One morning I woke up and found myself somewhere else. I was in like a park or something so, I started walking around trying to find out where I was. Then some boy ran into me and I fell to the ground and he said that he was really sorry and I told him it was OK and he helped me up. So I asked the boy why he was running and he said that Socs were running after him and I just gave him a puzzled look. Then all of a sudden a couple of guys came after the boy and tackled him to the ground and I yelled at them to get off of him. So they did, and they went away. So then the boy said thanks to me and that his name was Ponyboy and I told him that my name was Kaley. Then we started walking and talking and I asked him where we were and he said Tulsa Okahomla. So I asked him what year this was and he said the 1960's and I was shocked and confused and I think he knew it too because he asked me why I looked shocked. I told him that I wasn't from here and that I lived in the 2015. So Ponyboy asked me where I was from and I said New York. Then we started talking and getting to know each other better and it seemed like he would actually listen and he understood me more then anyone I know. Ponyboy asked me if I needed a place to stay and I said yes so he told me that I could stay at his house. So I said ok and we walked to his house.
