Minutes later, the girl was slowly regaining consciousness. Eventually, she fluttered her eyes open.
"Wh...What happened..?" She asked weakly as she sat up.
"Well, love... You somehow burst through that door, looked at us, and then fainted." I told her with a confused expression.
She just stared at me for a while and murmured something.
"No way...You're..."
"Hmm?" I moved closer to hear her better.
She shook her head. "N-Nevermind.. What I meant to say was... I was looking for a man named Prussia...Have you guys...seen him?"
"I'm sorry..but we haven't seen him. We just got here." China replied.
She then gave a surprised expression. "Really? You just...got here..."
The girl fell silent for a few moments.
"Then...that leaves me all alone." She stated.
I tilted my head. "Alone?"
China's eyes widened. "Wait...Why are you even he-"
"Listen, if it's not much of a bother.. can I join you guys?" The girls adds quickly.
"Well... Sure.. It's not like we can just leave you here all alone, aru. You agree, right, Opium?" China asks.
"Of course. It is a gentleman's duty to make sure of a young lady's safety, you know." I said nonchalantly.
The girls face suddenly brightened up with a smile. "Thanks, E-...Er.."
"Let me introduce myself, I am The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But please, just call me England." I told her.
"My name is ______ ______. You can call me (first name). It's a pleasure to meet you, England." She said as she extended her hand towards me.
Being the gentleman I was, I took her hand and kissed it. "The pleasure is all mine,  miss _____." I said.
After that, she turned a few shades of red. Oh dear. Did I do something wrong?
"Uh. Ni hao! I'm China, by the way." China cuts in.
The girl seemingly regains composure and smiles at China. "Hello. I'm _____." She said and once more extended her hand. This time to China.
China takes her hand and shakes it.
Oh.
A hand shake.
...
My way was waaay better
The girl then clears her throat. "Ahem. Thanks for helping me. Anyways...uhm, so were are you guys to?" She asks.
"Well, we were going to check the third and fourth floors." China replies.
"Hold on, are you alright now?" I ask her.
She smiled at me once more. "Yes. Thank you for asking. I am very much okay now so uhm, let's go take a look upstairs together...I might find Prussia there."
China and I nodded and we all went outside the room.
