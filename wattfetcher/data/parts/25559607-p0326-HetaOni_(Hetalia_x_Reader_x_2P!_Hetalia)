"....Believe it or not...The Second Players want to call a temporary truce with you guys. They even want to talk to you guys about something." I told them.



Their facial expressions were of mixed emotions. Curious, skeptical, disbelieving, and all that. After a few moments of silence, Romano spoke up, "You do know that that's probably a trap, right? It's pretty obvious."



"I agree with Romano, frau. They probably set this up against us." Prussia said.




Frowning, I sighed. "Yeah...Okay, I must admit that it does sound suspicious..." I clenched my fist. "...but what if they were serious? This could help solve all your misunderstandings!"



They looked at each other for a while, then, weird as it looks, I saw most of them smile.



"Very well, then. Tell them that we'll try it out." France said.

I sort of felt both elated in uneasy when I heard them agree on meeting up with the 2Ps again. It's like, I'm glad that they're possibly talk...in civil terms (hopefully)...but I'm also nervous about what will happen. I mean, I seriously think that the 2Ps have an ulterior motive on this. What if they just plan to have bloodshed during the whole thing? But then...I can't just assume that they will (even though...there's...a big possibility...)...and the 1Ps seems like they also want to try talking to them....so why not, right?
