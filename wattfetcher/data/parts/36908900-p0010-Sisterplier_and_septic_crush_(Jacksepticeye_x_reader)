Y/n's POVI awaken to some type of glass shattering noise I sit up...rub my eyes and see I am in my own home. I smile as I get up I put on a nice booper dooper shirt from Jack and then Marks old Markiplier pajama sweats he passed onto me. I walk out into the hall finding my way to the kitchen, there I see two doofs... one with a broom in hand another with a trash bin "What the fuck did you two do?" I ask Jack and Mark "Well...." Jack starts off "We were trying to make breakfast..." Mark finishes "You really should leave that to me!" I laugh "shoo shoo! Out of the kitchen!" I say moving them out of my way so I can clean after the two kiddos "you both are bad..." they both laugh "and immature..." I say pointing at them broom still in hand, Jack walks over to me "Well y/n... Mark is letting me move in with you both!" Jack said jumping up and down with Mark "Well thats great and all but... where would you sleep?" I ask looking at both of the boys, "Well... we can have you sleep in my bed for now until we maybe move or something else...." Mark mumbles the last part "or you can share the room with me Jack!?" I ask jack, way more excited then I should be... "I would be fine with that!" Mark screeches I smile, same do the boys and soon after I continue cooking breakfast...______A/NSo I am sorry this is short but heeey its still an update anyway its like 3:30 am here.... soooo sleepy but I love you guys enough to write for you!!
