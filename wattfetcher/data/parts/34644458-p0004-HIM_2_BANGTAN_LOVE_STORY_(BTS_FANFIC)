I smiled. "Saranghaeyo.."

"Ight break time. Wooh!"
Jungkook: ahhh...practice is always exhausting...
Jimin: you guys are tired? Wimps.
Suga: ya...we're not high on stamina like you are..
Jin: I am. I'm gonna lay here and just sleep.
V: I don't like dancing at this moments ugh!
J-Hope: I need to call and check on the babies.
While they do that, I'll go for a walk around the building. To see if I get inspired or something.
I stepped out and walked down the hall.
I took out my phone and went over my lyrics..
-bump-
"*gasp* Hyun-mi..I'm..I..I'm sorry.."
She chuckled. "It's okay, I'm fine. Not your fault I'm blind."
I smiled. "It's okay, I'm blind as well hehe.."
She lightly smiled and looked away, man she is so beautiful.
"You're rather extremely tall in person." She said.
I scratched my head awkwardly.
"Oh..heh..is that a bad thing?"
"Absolutely not." She smiled.
(^.^)
"Heh..uh.." I'm not sure what to say.
"Can I check out what you guys are working on?" She asked.
"Yeah of course!" I led the way. My heart is throbbing so hard. I think I'm gonna faint.
I step inside the dance room and everyone seemed to be minding their business. Hobies on the phone, Jungkook and Tae are slapping each other? Bimbos. Jin is laying there, Suga's looking through the laptop and Jimin.. oh. Checking himself out through the mirror. Typical.
Jungkook: Oh..Hi Hyun-mi.
He walked over to her and gave her a pound.
Hyun-mi: Hi Jungkook...
Jungkook remained staring at her.
Taehyung walked over to us.
V: What is she doing here?
"She wants to see what we're working on."
Suga: She can do that when the choreographer gets here. We're not her teachers?
Hyun-mi: (sadly looks away)
"Okay? Whats with your attitude? We can't just show her?"
Suga: -_- (leaves)
What's his deal?
Jin: He's just tired man..
Jimin: But we don't usually work with our back up dancers anymore.
"Oh my god does that fucking matter?"
Everyone was startled at my response. Even Hyun-mi.
Jungkook: Hyun-mi, have seat. We'll show you.
