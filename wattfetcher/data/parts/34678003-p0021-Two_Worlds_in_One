We walked upstairs up to my room to get dressed for the day. Anna - being alway modest in her style put on a pair of long pink skinny pants - I have the same pair. She paired the pink pants with a mint green tank top with a white trim around the neck. She slipped on some sandals with white straps. As always, she really only does eye make up because she is perfect - and her eye make up makes her brown eyes stand out so well.
I wore a mint green shirt like Anna, but mine was a slightly lighter shade and it had a bow on it. It was a pretty hot day at the end of May so I decided to wear jean short shorts. Yes - I paired that with my traditional white Keds. I wore white pearls - a gift from my parents two Chisrtmas' back - Anna didn't have her ears pierced so she obviously didn't wear earrings. I simply put on mascara and eye liner - nothing too fancy just enough to make my deep blue eyes stand out. One time my dad was teasing me and said my eyes were NAPA blue like Chase's car but actually that color is pretty close. To top my outfit all off - red lipstick - thank god I can pull that off - and my red sunglasses so I match.
I grabbed my white bag with black polka dots - sort of like a back pack style bag. I usually used this bag as a purse, it includes; my wallet, a mini hand sanitizer, some emergency feminine products, hand warmers (left over from the winter!), my phone charger chord, the wall jack from the USB to the wall plug, a charger from the USB to the car charger, a mini bottle of lotion, a granola bar, a pack of tissues, a sharpie, a pen, a mechanical pencil, a pair of no-show socks. Woah - I have a lot of stuff in here! Anna and I took off. We got in my car and headed to the mall - opposite direction of Dover.
