Mostly all we do is sleep and eat. But Bucky has been talking a bit more.
Why did they bring you here? He asked.

I don't know. I am nobody special. Not even to SHEILD.

Your not an agent?

No. I am a helper. I listen when people need to talk things out.

Oh.  Why did Hydra bring you?

I was the only one there.

Tell me about Steve.

I went on and on for a long time about Steve. Bucky listened with his usual expressionless mask on. When I had finished, I added
He told me about you.

He did?

Yes. I loved reading stories about you. I always had an interest in you and your story.

Tell me my story.

And I did. I told him everything.

I wish I could remember.

Its ok Bucky. they are not gone forever.

All too soon I realized my mistake. I had called him Bucky. But he didn't do anything.

You can call me Bucky now.

Thank you.

Did Hydra hurt you?

Not really.

They hurt people. The made a monster out of me.

No! You are not a monster! You are a man! You feel  and you hurt just like me! I screamed. Bucky looked down at the floor. I walked over and kneeled down. My hands slid up and cradled his face. I saw tears in his glassy eyes.

Please. Don't call yourself a monster. I whispered. I released his face and his hand came up and gently touched my face.

I awoke to metal against metal. I knew what was happening. They were going to take Bucky. They couldn't! I wouldn't let them. I breathed a sigh of relief when I found I would be questioned more. It went exactly like last time. I was punished again after not knowing the answers. In a fit of anger, the man threw a knife at my shoulder. I was dragged from the room.
I was tossed in my cell. Bucky stood up when I came in. I rolled over onto my back. I groaned and yanked the knife from my shoulder. I wrapped my arms around my still painful ribs and tucked my knees in as close as I could. I rested my head on my knee and began to cry. I had forgotten all about Bucky. Only when I felt strong arms around me and a chin on my head, did I remember.  He held me close. Not because he was going to tell me it would stop, but to tell me he would protect me because it would never end. I felt so lost. I realized that the tragic hero gone wrong was a just a scared sad boy and right now I felt like a scared sad little girl. We held on to each other because that was all we had left to hold on to.
