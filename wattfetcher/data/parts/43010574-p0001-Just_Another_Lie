You said you loved me So I felt like i could trust youTell you all my secretsGive u my soul to keep safeBut i was wrongSooo wrongI took down my barriersThinkin that it wouldnt be a problemBut you changedAnd you didn't love meYou lied to meIt was all just a game to youYou called me namesI started believing they were trueSo i started cutting my wristsYou made me want to kill myselfI almost didSo i distanced myself from everybodyI hardly talked to anyoneAnd i kept cutting my wristThinking i wasn't good enoughBut now i know it wasn't trueIt was just another lie from you.
