(Chloe and her friend are texting while Chloe is driving)
Chloe- I am leaving and on my way. Brent is with me to.
Abby: hurry we only get the cabin for three days then my sister wants it.
Chloe: fine fine fine I'm on my way I'll be there in 20 minutes.
"Hey Chloe stop texting, your driving.... it's NOT safe and ILLEGAL" said Brent. "Brent, yeah yeah yeah we're safe it's fine and I'm paying attention" said Chloe. " I mean it and sure you are" said Brent. (Chloe's phone buzzed) It's my mother.
Mom/Lisa : have fun at the cabin
Chloe: yes mom I......... (Crash)
(Their car is crashed to the side and the whole dashboard caves in"
"Oooowwwww" they scream. "CHLOE" screamed Brent. "sorry" said Chloe. " Owww my arm screamed Chloe as her arm was filled with glass.
"I'll put this phone to some use for real life reality emergencies" said Brent ( he picked up the phone in so much pain but managed to dial the number 911).
In too much pain and car to smashed they can't get out of their brand new Audi to see the other end of the accident.
Chloe in large amounts of guilt knows this whole accident is her fault because of texting while driving and knows that the cops are on their way with help. But she knows they are going to give her consequences because she just caused this by doing something she shouldn't have in the first place It may have been better to listen to Brent.
