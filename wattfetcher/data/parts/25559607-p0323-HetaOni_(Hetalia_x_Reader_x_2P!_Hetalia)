"Ooohh! I can't believe I haven't noticed him the whole time! He's so flufffeehh!" I squealed.


Canada was looking away for some reason, but spoke, "Y-You can hold him if you want, eh?"



"Really? I'd love to!" I said, hugging the white polar bear.



Kumajiro looked pretty comfortable in my arms and snuggled closer to me. I felt like I was hugging a big fluffball. Oh. I am.



Looking up at me, Kumajiro spoke, "Phone."



"Oh! Right...er..how did you know that my phone was buzzin'?" I asked.



Canada hesitantly faced me and answered, "Well, when I told Kumajiro to take a nap on a bed, he ended up sleeping on yours. But then after a few moments, he complained to me that he couldn't sleep because your phone kept vibrating. So, we thought you'd want to know."



"Ah, I see. Thanks! Sorry about your nap, Kumajiro." I said.



The polar bear shook his head and snuggled closer to me again, "It's okay."



"W-Well, I'm gonna be done here soon, so...here ya go." I said as I handed back Kumajiro to Canada.


Stiffening a bit, Canada reached out his arms for the polar bear. "A-Ah, yeah..."


"Oh man...hahaha!" I laughed.



Raising an eyebrow at me, Canada asked, "What is it?"



"Now I've got some bear fur on me." I said, pointing out the white strands of polar bear hair on me.
