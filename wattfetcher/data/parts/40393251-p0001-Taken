I took another drink. The alcohol was already making me dizzy. I really didn't care. I sat at the bar and asked Carter for another drink. The club music was very loud so I didn't hear a guy sit down next to me. He had messy brown hair and he was gorgeous.  HIs steely grey eyes turned to me. I was slightly mesmerized by his stare, I tore my gaze away from him and got up. I finished my drink and paid Carter. I left stumbling on my way to the door. I felt someone stare burning me as I opened the door. Stumbling through it I realized I needed a ride. Cursing I grabbed my phone and called Cindi, my older sister. I leaned against the wall and waited for my sister's silver car to pull up. After ten minuet sit did and I climbed  in. Cindi was mad at me. "I cant believe you got drunk again, Alex!" She yelled at me. "shut up, Cindi" I said, My head was beginning to hurt and her yelling at me really didn't help. "your barely 17, Carter shouldn't have given you alcohol. Just because he likes you doesn't mean you can make him give you alcohol" She said dragging her fingers through her long red hair. I sighed. "Cindi pull over" I said and pointed to a fast food restaurant. I felt like I was going to be sick. She shook her head and I got out. I went to the bathroom and threw up everything in my system. Then I went and ordered a soda, trying to get rid of the taste in my mouth. I walked out and didn't see Cindy's car. I looked around and thought she probable ditched me. She gets mad when I drink. I wasn't that far from home. I started to walk home. After ten minuets of walking I noticed a car behind me. At first I thought I was hallucinating but after another five minuets I speed up so did the car. Definitely not a hallucination. I threw my soda to the side and ran. The car followed.
