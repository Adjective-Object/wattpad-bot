Life is hard and honestly it's utterly crap .
You know how we go through everyday , like nothing happened but actually we hide things pretty well
Everyone does.
What I want to ask the world is why did my mum gave birth to an ugly creature like me, if I was meant to be this ugly , why did you keep me living  till this moment.
Oh how I wish to go back in time when I was freakin social , happy , and always smiling.
Right now , I don't even know myself , I have become this girl that is anti social with rude attitude and smiling is ancient for me nowadays because I barely do.
Another thing I want to share my opinion about , bullying.
Why the fudge are you bullying people ?Why me ? Why are you calling me names ? Why are you hitting me ? Why are you killing me inside ?
I pretty much tried to fight back but I learned now that every time you do , you lose instead of actually win so why bother trying.
Nobody understands me not even my sister that tried to cheer me up but ended up leaving me because "I depress her" , her words not mine.
Why can't everybody just leave me alone ?
I don't understand why some people lie to me telling me I mean a lot to them and I got attached to them then they just leave me like an ugly rag.
Like ugh just stop , if you will end up doing this in the end , just don't talk to me from the beginning.
You don't have to know my name , just know me as the " the_annoying_unicorn "
