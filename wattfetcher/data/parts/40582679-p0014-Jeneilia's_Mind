Hey guys I'm at the dumb salon!! Lmao I don't like the Salon sometimes i mean its alright but way too much gossiping and its a bit of waste of time I know you go to make your hair look nice but hot damn it feels like waste of time. From I was little I always wanted to like have a spinning chair that you go under and then they spin you once then your hair is done within 10 seconds lmaooo!!! yeah I know stupid but I'm 13 years old now and I'm still waiting for some damn scientist to invent it lol or maybe I'll do it when I get older and test it on my bestie 34angilee lmaoo just joking!. So anyways I'm here and Im waiting on this lady to finish her hair and the hair dresser and her are like gossiping away!!! And I'm like do you not seee here waiting and what there talking about doesn't even make any damn sense. I'm so bored no ones texting me and I'm just here sitting and writing  ughhhh. I have to come here every 5 or 2 weeks because my hair have in chemical and every time the chemical wears out I have to come put more back in it or my hair will look terrible and it might fall off which is super badddd!!!!! So yeah I have to come back here within a couple weeks. For the summer I think I'm gonna braid it or dye it I don't know but I wanna do something amazing with my hair for my birthday. I love my best friend hair its so damn beautiful and curly and cute and hot damn perfect lol. The hair dresser is calling me now so see yall later :*  ~Jeneilia Xxx
