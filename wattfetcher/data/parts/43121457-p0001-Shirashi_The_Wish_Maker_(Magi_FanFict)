I jumped with joy before hugging Ugo- kun's  head. 'Yay! Thank you Ugo- kun!' I shouted happily. He chuckled before putting on his serious face. 'Now remember Shirashi. You can change into any other form if you really have too. Otherwise, people from the great three kingdoms will come and try to hunt you down and find you.' I nodded obediently notifying him that I understood. The giant gold gates opened and pulled me off the ground. I waved at Ugo- kun while smiling happily. 'Bye- bye! I will see you again!

She waved at us happily, obviously not knowing the situation she was now apart of. 'Hello! My name is Shirashi! Say one wish you would like and I will grant it!' She shouted. All of our eyes widened. "W-what did she say?!"
