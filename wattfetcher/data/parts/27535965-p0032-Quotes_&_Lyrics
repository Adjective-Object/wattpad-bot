"Don't ask me to explain. It hurts me. Because I don't know how to. Don't ask me to describe how it felt. Because it's undescriptible. Don't ask me how I felt. Because you won't understand. Don't ask me how it happened. Because I don't know myself. Don't ask my why it happened. Because I don't know either.
Now, as me how I feel.
It feels like a mess of emotions. You're never fully sad. You're never fully happy. It's not bipolar. It's your own mind betraying you. You can't control it. Believe me.
~me (again)
I'm not lying to anybody. This is exactly how I feel.
Next quote page will be kind of a continue or explanation.
