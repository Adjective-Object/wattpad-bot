If someone told me the burden of taxes then I sure as hell wouldn't have grown up.
I guess my part time job as a tutor isn't exactly working to well.
Who am I kidding I can barely afford cable let alone an apartment.
Coffee.
The perfect answer to my problem.
Well really the perfect distraction from my problem. But you can't solve your problems while struggling to stay awake, therefore I'm going to Starbucks.
I spend about ten minutes trying to find my car keys until I say screw it. I grab a warmer jacket and my wallet and walk out of my apartment locking the door on my way out. Damn I should probably attach both sets of keys together but decide to save that task for another day.
It feels foreign walking the few blocks to Starbucks. I always drive despite the short distance to the drive through but today I think I'll sit at one of the fire places. As I'm picturing this lovely seen I trip over a pink tricycle decorated with streamers.
Yep.
This is why I don't walk places.
When I open the door the single ding fills the surprisingly empty store. "Niall, customer," I hear a stern voice yell. Ha. Niall. Like the river! What kind of name is that? -I see a very and might I say very attractive blonde peek his head out into view. -A perfect name that is.
This is what I've been missing for so long!
I really need to walk here more.
"Hello, what can I get for ya," he asked me in a thick accent. Holy... "Grande coffee-black." Niall smirks before breaking into a huge smile showing off his perfect teeth,"Tough day?" Not anymore. "You could say that." I hand him the money placing the remaining change in the tip jar.
He flashes his teeth once more before grabbing a cup."Oh, almost forgot- name?" At this I let out a little laugh,"You do realize that I'm the only customer, right?" He blushed slightly at my response and stared down at his feet saying,"I just kinda want to know ya name." I too started blushing until I had the courage to say,"Lillien." With that he wrote something I couldn't make out and fixed up my coffee in record time.
He handed me the cup so fast that the steaming coffee almost spilled. I turned the cup around and read the words 'Lilly belly'. That name puts a stab in my heart as the memories come flooding in and Niall notices my once happy face disappeared.
"Oh, um-I'm sorry- uh didn't mean to upset ya with that name, I'll change it," he says a little too quick. I shake my head before bluntly saying," I have to go."
I quickly leave the store not looking back once.
Well I probably freaked him out.
I sigh and look down to the letters scribbled in a boyish manner. I haven't heard that name since my parents died. The guilt of fleeing from the tiny shop starts to sink in. How was he supposed to know that? I think to myself for the remaining of my short walk.
When I enter my kitchen I am aware of my ever present problem. Bills cover my kitchen table and I start to panic.
Is winning the lottery an option?
I hope to god that it is because I need money.
Fast.
After pacing back and forth for several minutes I decide to call my brother.
-Little sis! Long time no talk!
