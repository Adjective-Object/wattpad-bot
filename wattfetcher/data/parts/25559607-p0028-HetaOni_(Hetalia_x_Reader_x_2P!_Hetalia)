---CHAPTER IV: Gunshots (Part 2)---
~Reader-chan's PoV~
I know this part of the game...but things aren't really making sense. Why did Japan and the others suddenly disappear? Did I jump through time or something? No.. I'm not that far in the game yet...
I was thinking of so many things that I didn't notice that we were already in the fourth floor.
All three of us went inside the room with the AmeriMochi in it.
England then notices something. "Oh! That's..." He points to the red chair.
"What a creepy chair.It looks like a cursed chair I saw somewhere." China comments.
*coughBusby'sChaircough*
England fell silent.
"Well, we've come all the way to the 4th floor,but... everything looks pretty normal. The air is terrible, though." He finally says.
China nods. "The bad feeling still isn't gone. Let's go back to France and go home!"
England agrees. "Yeah. Well, let's--"
On cue, we heard gun shots.
"That sound..." England whispers.
China furrowed his eyebrows. "Is it the sound of America's pistol? He fired a lot."
England gave a worried look. "That means something must have happened,right?"
"In a place like this? Don't you think he just fell for Russia's provocation?" China reasons.
"Oh, well.They do get carried away when they mess around with each other..." England agrees.
"Are... you guys sure?" I ask quietly.
"No... I feel that it's something different from messing around...Anyway, let's join France and go take a look." China finally says.
England huffs. "Pfffff...If you insist!"
We then rushed down to the second floor.

==2nd floor==
"15 minutes...
... Isn't France coming?" England says as he tapped his shoes on the floor.
"What's the meaning of this? It shouldn't take this long to see the second floor." China says.
"Maybe he got tired of waiting and went downstairs?" England concludes.
"Well, he certainly gets bored easily. I'll check the rooms on the second floor tomake sure we didn't miss each other. You two wait here!" China tells us.
England nods. "Yeah, or else we might miss each other again."
"W-Wait!" I exclaimed.
China then turned around to face me. "What is it, aru?"
"I want to check that room over there, too." I told him.
China then motions me to join him. "Alright. Let's go."
We entered the fireplace room again.
"Mhhm...So they really aren't here.." I say softly.
China walks over to the fireplace "Burnt firewood...So this is the source of the bad smell."
I went closer to where China was and saw him very confused and out of words.
Finally, he was able to speak, "... Huh?
