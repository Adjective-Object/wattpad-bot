Starting to give a small smile, Canada spoke, "Thank you, Italy. I hope so, too... I guess I just took it a little more personally than I should have. As you might know, I am actually quite used to being the invisible one. The one that's always forgotten...
But when I met (Name), I felt like I wasn't as invisible anymore. She always remembered me. She would always meet my gaze and acknowledge my presence, even if America was around. Back then, I thought that America was the reason why I was always overshadowed (though most times, I still think he is the reason), but she proved me wrong about that thought.
I started not to care about being unnoticed by others, as long as she noticed me.
Maybe that's why I got really hurt when I found out that she wasn't able to remember me anymore..."
Canada turned to Italy and noticed a weird smile on the Italian's face. "O-Oh! I've...I've ranted for too long. I'm sorry about that. U-Uhm, just forget those last things I've said. You weren't listening, eh?" the Canadian rambled.
"Ehehehe. It's perfectly fine, Canada . I can see that you really like the bella. That's why you were so down about it, huh?" Italy said, slightly teasing.
Turning into fifty shades of red, Canada let down his polar bear and waved his hands frantically in front of him. "E-EH? No-I, I was just, uhm... Maybe it's just you're imagination... I, well, just described what I thought about her without thinking..and uhm..."
"That's the point. You said those things from the heart. Besides, your eyes practically shined when you said all that." Italy pointed out.
Looking away, Canada tried to think of how to change the subject. "Oh, uh! By the way, I have a few questions about what you were able to talk about with (Name) when you bumped into her earlier..."
"Huh? Like what?" Italy asked curiously.
Canada recalled something that (Name) said that bothered him. Creasing his forehead, he spoke, "While I was on the phone with (Name), she denied that that was her name and referred to herself as '(Second Name)'....but what made me confused that most was that she said she was being mistaken for a little girl-"
***RIIIINGGG****
All of a sudden, they both heard a phone ring. Checking their pockets, Italy spoke, "Oh, is it my phone?" He then excused himself as he answered the call.
Canada looked up and thought hard.
"What if there were more mysteries in this mansion than we thought?"

"...Hetalia..."

Uncontrollably, tears started streaming down my cheeks as memories began to resurface ever so painfully. Of the good and of the bad. It's not all that clear, but I was slowly recalling enough.
"...I can't...believe that I forgot...about Hetalia..." I cried as I realised that fact.
