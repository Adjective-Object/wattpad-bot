Cheri POV: Present
I didn't need Zach anyways. Okay...maybe a little. Well I defiantly needed a place to sleep.
I pulled out my phone then searched through the short list of contacts. I could go to Alec's...maybe. I have other friends I could stay with but ever since Zach I never really hung out with them.
Shaking my head I slipped my phone into my back pocket. Living with Zach for two years had made me soft. I didn't need to rely on anyone.
Wiping my eyes of tears, I started walking in the direction of an old hostel I used to stay at. Back when I still had my little brother. On the walk I pondered over what Zach had said.
Why would I? I was really surprised at that. And hurt a little. I lie easily, but I hardly ever lie to Zach. I was lying that time but I had to lie.
Not the point.
When I looked back at him I saw annoyance and...regret maybe? Regret about what though? Regret saying those words or just regret over taking me in as his girl friend? Most likely the second one. I would regret it if I were him but I guess I'll never know. But I also heard pity in his voice after he said that. That was pathetic on my part. Was he really only my boyfriend because he pitied me? Because he didn't think he could just throw me back out on the streets again? Probably. That's probably why.
And I hate it. I can handle myself, it's not like I'm a charity case. I love Zach so much, but if he's just keeping me around because he feels bad then I wish he would just dump me already.
Honestly Zach, you shouldn't believe me.
Approaching the hostel I thought about how I should just go back to Zach's, but that would be too embarrassing. My stubbornness got the of me.
