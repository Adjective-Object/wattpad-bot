"I miss you... right now. I wish -- "
"I called? Because so do I. I wish we talked more last night and I wish I could forgive myself over a little -- actually not so little -- mistake like this... not that it wasn't bad and a big mistake, but things could have been worse." I said.
"Are we better now? Are we okay?" He asked.
"I don't know, are we?" I asked.
"I'd say we're at least getting there." He said.
"I love you... so so much, Jordan." I said as I wrapped my arms around one of his.
"I need my arm a second... just real quick." He said.
"Wh -- " I said.
"Just one second." He said before putting his hands around my face and kissing me. "I love you." He said.
"I love you, Jordan." I said.
"Thank you." He said.
"Yeah, I can't believe myself... I almost lost you to a single mistake I made... a mistake I made horribly."
Jordan said the sweetest thing I've heard him say in a while, I got out of bed and sat down on the floor because I started to cry, Jordan rolled over to my side of the bed and kissed my head making me cry even more.
"You could never lose me, only I can lose you." He said.
"Oh my god." I said.
"What?" He asked.
"I will never stop loving you."
