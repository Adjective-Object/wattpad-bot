Chapter 10
Shea's P.O.V
I sat on my bed, my knees to my chest, dried tears stained my cheeks with their paths. I have not left my room since I found Seth and that girl yesturday. He tried talking to me, tried getting in to explain, but what I saw was enough. I can't believe he would do that.... Yeah I guess I saw it coming when I kissed Casper in the hallway, If I was Seth I would be mad too but I would't go and fuck someone.
I took a deep breath and looked over at the door.
Should I go out?
Should I take the chance of facing Seth?
Should I even risk talking to Casper?
Casper.
I get up and go to my purse and grab my phone and unlock it and see I have 20 txts and 34 missed calls from Casper! The texts mostly said:
Shea! Are you okay?
I miss you baby
Call me
BABE!
ANSWER
I took a deep breath and decided to call him later. I can't deal with him right now.
I walked slowly to my door and unlocked it. I slowly opened it and looked out. Seth was sitting there... and looking up at me. He quickly stood up. He was in sweatpants and no shirt. Hes going to kill me.
"Shea..." He said softly. I just looked at him. I thought all my tears were gone but they weren't. The started falling. "Oh Shea I am so sorry" He walked over to me and tried hugging me.
"No Seth don't fucking touch me!"
"Sh-"
"Seth no! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!!" I yelled tears falling down my cheeks
"SHEA LET ME FREAKING EXPLAIN!"
"You have 5 fucking minutes" I said tapping my foot, my tears clearing.
"Can we sit in your room?" He asked
"I suppose. No funny buisness" I said moving so he could walk Â in.
I closed the door behind me and then was pushed up against the wall. My arms above my head and Seths bottom half pressed against mine.
"Se-"
"No Shea I am going to talk and you are going to listen" I looked at him rage filling my eyes.
"Seth let go"
"Not until you listen" He said looking deep into my eyes.
"I am listening" I said looking away from his eyes.
"Look me in the eyes Shea" I looked up into his eyes. His where full of tears. One escaped and I could help but feel bad. I hurt him just as much as he hurt me...
"Okay I'm listening"
"When I saw you with Casper I literally felt my heart brake Shea. I told you I hated seeing you in his arms why did you go and do it? The only thing I could think of is you were trying to getback at me. But when you kissed him and how you kissed him I knew you meant it"
I didn't mean it Seth. I mean it when I kiss you.
"I don't know what i'm supposed to do Shea. I am so sorry for what I have done to you. Your not a slut, if anything I am the slut. I am so fucking sorry" More tears fall from Seth's eyes. I wanted to hug him, to make him feel better. But why do I feel like its a bad idea. I don't want to get hurt, I don't want to hurt him anymore.
