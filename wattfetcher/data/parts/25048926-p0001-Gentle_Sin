"Take me to church. I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies. I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife. Offer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my life."
Jacob Avery has committed one of the worst sins. He is no longer the innocent, golden boy which his town views him as. He seeks absolution and only then can he be human, only then he can be clean.

So, I've been pondering the topic of homosexuality for a long time, and I've decided to write what I think about in a form of a short story. My school has put on a play all about Matthew Shepard, a young boy murdered for being gay. To be perfectly honest, I cried, and I'm disgusted how people treat other just because they are different. This book is inspired by the song "Take Me To Church" by Hozier. There is also the book "Born Sick" by TheUJelly_ inspired by the same song. I recommend reading it. It's beautifully written. However, this book will not be similar in plot, but it will be in message.
