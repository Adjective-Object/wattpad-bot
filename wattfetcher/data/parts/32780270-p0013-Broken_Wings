Miku studied her treasured memento in one hand and the bloodied feather in the other.
They were identical.
A/N:
So welcome to the next big Kaito and Miku story.  This one is a bit more sprawling and complex than my last story, and it’s based off of some lore I’ve used for non-Vocaloid materials in the past.  Since it’s entirely original, expect to see a lot more of your favorite characters. We are quite a ways off from seeing our entire cast.  This won’t be a tight romance like The Summer and Winter Garden was, but I hope if you enjoyed that story that you will still enjoy this one.
While I set this story in modern day Japan, I’ve deliberately chosen to downplay the use of honorifics aside from occasional flavor or if they’re significant.  I used to do them more, but over time I’ve gotten to the point where I feel it’s far too easy to create an artificial language barrier for a story written in English for people who primarily speak or read in English.  Also expect that unless something needs to be written in Japanese, it’s not going to be – exceptions for words like sempai, or samurai, which should need no explanation.
One of the fun things about writing a modern fanfic is it is a lot easier to reference costume designs and modules from the games! Can you spot them all?  Hint: I stole most of them from Project Diva. Miku’s outfit, however, was poached from some fan art of Rolling Girl that uses a different design than the module in Project Diva.
Song Credits: Miku was practicing Weekender Girl (I GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME), and attempting to write Tell Your World. And I’m sure that will NEVER come up again.
