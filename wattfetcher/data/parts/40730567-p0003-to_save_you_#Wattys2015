Isn't it ironic that the thing that makes us feel most alive is the thing that kills us?

Jake looked down at the anonymous text and sighed angrily. Who the hell was that person and why did they keep messaging him? He didn't need anyone's pity. And especially some coward that couldn't even tell who they were. He closed his eyes in annoyance. He was annoyed at everyone, and everything. He could hear his sister and her best friend chatting about nonsense. He has always hated her, the friend. She is such a brat, thinking that she will always get what she wants. Jake has hated Abrielle from their diaper days. But his hatred for her grew over time, and the list of reasons was long. He could hear her annoying giggles, which pissed the hell out of him.

I know you're sad, so I won't tell you to have a good day. Stay alive, feed yourself well, wear comfortable clothes and don't give up on yourself just yet. It'll get better. Until then, have a day.
