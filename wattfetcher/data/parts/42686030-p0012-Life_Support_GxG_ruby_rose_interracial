" I'm right here Nigga" who the f-I back handed her making her fall on the floor " come on get up you saltine cracker " she got up trying to tackle me but I grabbed her shirt and kneed her in the stomach two times. She reached up grabbing my hair pulling us both down I climbed ontop of her and threw blow after blow to her face " You crazy Bitch. Don't mess with what's MINE." She wrapped her legs around my neck and flipped me on my back getting above me and kicking me in my stomach for some reason it felt way worse than it should when getting kicked in the stomach.
