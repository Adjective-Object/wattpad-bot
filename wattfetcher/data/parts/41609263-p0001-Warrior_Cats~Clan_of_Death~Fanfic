"All cats old enough to catch their own prey,meet before me at the red stone."
~It was time,I am becoming deputy~.Wolfpelt thought proudly.She went with the other DeathClan cats to the red stone.Their leader,DeathStar founder of DeathClan,stood at the top of the stone.His dark pelt gleamed in the sunlight.
"I have gathered you all here for a announcement.I am chosing my deputy.".DeathStar looked at Wolfpelt,a hidden emotion hidden within his amber eyes.
"As we all know,we must be strong so I chose my best warrior to be my heir.".He paused,making sure he had everyones attention."Wolfpelt will be my first deputy.I hope your all think that my choice is a good one.Anyway,another thing is,we will be going to what the other clans call a gathering.So first job for Wolfpelt is to choose who to come.".He flicked his tail,signaling the meeting was over.
Then a young apprentices ran up to Wolfpelt."Mama,I am so happy for you!Darkpaw caught a rabbit and said you can have it.It's huge!Come see!".The apprentice lead her mother to the rabbit out infront of the warriors den.Darkpaw was sitting near it,a proud gleam in his eyes.
"It's for you,hope you like it.Ravenpaw said it was the biggest she has ever seen.".He said and walked off with his sister.
Wolfpelt ate the rabbit in a few bites.Then she went and looked around the camp.~I can choose FoxHeart,Darkpaw,Springleap,Thornclaw,and Hookfang.~
She went to DeathStars den,a small cave behind the red stone with moss hiding the entrance.She walked in and told him her choice.
"Good,choice.If we need to fight we have some warriors to help.".Deathstar looked at Wolfpelt,he had been her mentor,so they had a bond."Tell the cats chosen to get ready.We leave at sunset.".He ordered.Wolfpelt left,told the cats she choose and got ready.By the time sunset came they were in veiw of the island.They saw a group of cats head towards the trees.They waited until the moon was in the sky to make their move.The cats of the clans best be ready,for the are coming.
