Stop! Stop stop stop!! Naruto mentally screamed at the fox. He grabbed his head at the pain he now had.
"I'll be your sheild. You are My life and I will protect that life..." Sasukes voice echoed in narutos mind like silk.
Naruto soon felt warm. Like someone had draped a blanket over him.
"Are you okay, naruto?" A squeaky voice asked. Hinata?
"Hinata? Why are you here?" Naruto asked. "Why are you helping me?"
"Because I'm not a cruel person. Now come on I'll walk with you to your place. Okay?" Hinata asked.
Naruto nodded as he wiped away tears with his sleeve, walking with his head bowed.
"Naruto, can I ask you something? Its important."
"Sure.....I guess."
"What is it that makes people hate you? I know you know the answer." Hinata said in a kind, gentle tone.
"Go ahead, tell her so she can hate you too, fool!" The nine tails bellowed.
"Have your heard the leagend of the nine tails?" Naruto asked
"Of course."
"Well I have the demon called the nine tailed fox kyuubi sealed inside me. The term is jinjuriki, a person with one of these tailed beasts sealed in them. If you didn't know the tailed beasts are really mass amounts of concentrated chakra. People used to always want to control these beasts and so they sealed them into children like me, and they are the same in every village. They're shunned by the villagers and hated by every one else..." Naruto explained.
Hina POV
Naruto.......so he's been alone all his life, and hated by everyone....i thought. "That's so sad...."
Naruto looked confused. "You're not afraid of me?"
"No. Why?" I asked. "Why would I be afraid? A demon doesn't make up who you really are. Its sad that you were all alone..."
"You should probably go. It's rainy and I'm sure sasuke will suspect your with me. But thanks, Hinata." Naruto said. He had a smile which looked good on him. I wanted to see him smile more.
