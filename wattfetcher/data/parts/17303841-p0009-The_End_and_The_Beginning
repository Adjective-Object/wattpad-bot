Five minutes later and I was been lifted into an ambulance and drove away to the hospital. I didn't like this being vulnerable. In training I was also told to evaluate a situation and find the nearest exit in case of an incident. It was my left leg that was injured and lucky for me that was my weaker leg. I finally got to the hospital and they took me in for surgery.
Two hours later the bullet had been removed from my upper left leg and I had been bandaged up and given some strong pain killers. Safe is what I felt right now but I shouldn't because of the dangers. Still I feel into a deep sleep.
