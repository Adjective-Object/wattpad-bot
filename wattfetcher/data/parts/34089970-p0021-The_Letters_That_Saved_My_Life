My phone buzzed as I walked to my second period class. Ignoring it I sat down in my seat. A yawn escapes my mouth as Katie walks in, sitting down next to me.
"Did you know there's a hot new student?" She asked me as I took out my pencil.
"No, what's his name?"
"Thomas. He has brown hair and gorgeous forest green eyes!"
"Thomas...." I say in disbelief. She looks at me weirdly as class starts.
Before I know it is lunch time, walking into the cafeteria I see Katie sitting at our table. As I start to walk over to her, when strong arms wrap around my waist. Lifting me off the ground and spinning me in a circle, I scream in surprise. After he stops spinning me, he lets go of my waist only to grab my hand. Looking up I see Tomas. Sitting down at the table Katie gives me a WTF look.
"Hello my name is Thomas, I'm Robin's boyfriend." Thomas said as he looked over at Katie.
"I'm Katie. Robin's friend." She told him as she gave me a we-are-totally-talking-about-this-later look. During lunch we talked about school to our favorite movies. Tomas hugs me before getting up and walking off.
After lunch I wave goodbye to Katie as I walk off to my next class. I glance down at my phone and realize I'm late for Art. Running down the hallway I trip over my own feet. Picking myself up off the ground I hear voices that sound very familiar.
"-Robin know?"
"I haven't told her yet.."
"You should considering telling her. She is your friend after all."
"Your right, I think she has figured it out by now."
"We need to get to class. If my mom gets another call home she will surely have my head."
Turning the corner I see Hunter and Derrick. With wide eyes Hunter asks me.
"How long were you standing there for...?"
"Long enough." I reply with a smile.
"Is there something you want to tell me?" I ask as I look at both of the boys.
