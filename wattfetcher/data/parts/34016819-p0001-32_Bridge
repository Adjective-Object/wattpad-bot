Turning my back on something is never what I wanted to do. But when my father kicked me out from working on the farm I did just that. Not intending or realizing leaving something so meaningful to me would be such a difficult move but it was. The young country boy cool cat in high school who thought it would be so cool to leave home and "grow up" doesn't feel so cool an grown up anymore. All I can say is when I left home chasin my dream I never thought It'd be such a task to continue my speed crossing over that 32 bridge while leaving my home town. But it was. Ill never forget it. The tears that filled my eyes remembering all the memories my friends and family had together. But as the memories filled my mind I began to smile. I thought about my future and what my new home might bring for my future wife and children and even for me. All the memories ill make while i am there.
As I pulled into my new homes driveway in the suburbs of Nashville I smiled. I looked out in the grasslands and down by the little creek that flowed. Sure they weren't georgia pines but we can still make memories. I looked at the woods of oak trees along the creek then decided to unpack my truck. While unpacking I thought about home. When's the next time I am gonna cross the bridge and enter Leesburg? I began packing everything up again. No Luke you can do this you are 24 years old take a chance pursue your dream. Your father and mother want you here. So does Chris. He's in your heart. I looked up at the sky and smiled. I finished unpacking. And I finally got settled into my new house that I can call home. 32 bridge was only a few thousand miles away. But i am here now and ill see it again.
