It's was a cold summers night in the streets of Dublin City. The sky was so clear that stars could be seen from all angles of the sky. The moon hung in the night sky like a disco ball shinning the dark ally ways. On the rooftops of the apartments, shops and other buildings a dark figure could be seen. This figure was a young girl of about the age of 17. A strong build from hours spent in the gym. A tattoo of a penguin on her right wrist to represent "loyalty" could be seen. Long brown hair with natural streaks of blonde highlights glistened in the moonlight. Black ankle length converse, super skinny black high waisted jeans with slits in the knees , a plain grey top and a hood less black leather jacket was what she wore. Casual and comfy. This girl may I say is the most feared lady in the whole world. Some of you may know her and others may not. She blends in with the crowd. Her name is unspoken of as no one knows what it is. She is known as T. Yes T. Only one letter from the alphabet but that one letter tells her past,present and future. The daughter of legends and the savour of  worlds.  This story is about how it all began.
