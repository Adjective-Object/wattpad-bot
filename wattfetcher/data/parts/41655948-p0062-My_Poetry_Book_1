I feel that my poetry is different.
My music is different.
The music I listen to is different.
Everything I am is Different.
But different is beautiful.
Be different!
Why fit in when you can stand out?
I know it's cheesy but look at the famous people
You look up to.
They're different.
Whatever it is they do, they've got something special about how they do it.
Being different is amazing,
It's grand.
So go there.
I don't f*cking care how stupid you look or sound,
Go for it.
You can't do anything great without failing a bit first.
