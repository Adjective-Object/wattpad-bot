"What do you mean?!" I yell and I rush in side. My mom was staring at the screen, jaw hanging open. She mumbled something under her breath"What?" I asked her, she swirled around and grabbed me by the arms"THEY KNOW WHERE HERE, I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY DO." She screamed"They also managed to deactivate our circular things using these," dad pulled out something that looked exactly like our circular things but had a red spot right next to the word Russia, terror filled his eyes"Francesca, that boy, Eli was his name, is not what he seems, he's American he's not one of us," mom said. Tears filled my eyes, my bet friend, lied to me. I stumbled back wards and held the wall for support. My mom put her hand on my shoulder"It will be alright, pretend nothing happened, get information out of him," dad said as he types a message back to head quarters about all of this. I didn't know what to do, my only friend worked for the USA, for those people, the people I was against. It didn't make any sense, he acted so calm around me, even after the whole incident with him during the circular thing, and he always played around with me like everything will be alright, that marking on his leg is a fake to put me into thinking he was on our side, is he not aware that he's the bad guy, that we... We're... Going to take over... When we got ahold... Of the device. . . Wait"Are we... the bad guys?" I ask"What?! Of course not. Why would you even think that?!?" Dad asked with anger."Well are mission is to practically take over and make America part of Russia,""Oh don't be silly, were the good guys, we are making are nation stronger!" Mom said with a smile. Well that is true, so he is the bad guy, that makes me feel a lot better. I smile at my mom, she always knows what to say.
