"Now hold on Outlander." The first of the Dunmer men called out as she whirled upon them savagely, her sword flashing in the dusky air. He was dressed in the Bonemold armour worn commonly by the Redoran guard and so were the three men flanking him. She was quite helplessly out matched, they all carried short swords, and were well and fully armoured whereas she wore nothing to protect her body from physical harm.
"What do you want with me?" she hissed, still brandishing her sword at the Mer.
"We want you to come along quietly. There is no running from the Redoran guard now outlander. We know what you've done and we will not hesitate to use deadly force."
Katya narrowed her eyes, "What in Oblivion are you talking about? Done? I've done nothing."
"Oh, come now. We have several reports from several villages of a human woman who matches your description to a T. We know you've robbed multiple farmers and killed only the Three know how many guars. Not to mention the farm that you burned to the ground entirely. I'm getting a little sick of you Nords thinking that you're high and mighty just because you're Nords, as if that's anything to hold above anyone else's head. Eh men?"
"You're an idiot." Katya replied tiredly as the Mer's men nodded agreement, faceless behind the insectile helmets, "I haven't done any of those things. Just ask my companion, he'll tell you just that."
The Mer looked back at his men briefly, "What companion? There was only one horse at your camp and only one set of gear. We're not so dumb as to fall for that. Now drop that sword and come along."
"What?" Katya was shocked, surely that could not be true. Anson would never desert her. They were partners. The Dunmer soldier tromped up to her and knocked the sword out of her hand. She let the weapon drop and obediently put her hands out in front of her for the Mer to tie them. Her mind was racing wildly; perhaps Anson had seen the Redoran guard approach and had set off to help her escape. Or maybe they were lying about the camp. It could be that they hadn't even come across it.
The guard shoved her forwards and she stumbled across the soot before them, going towards the place where she and Anson had camped. As they passed the area she saw that what they had said was true, only her horse remained, saddled and ready to be off. The leader of the guards ordered one of his men to take the horse along as well and they headed for Mournhold. Anger at her friend's betrayal weighed heavily in Katya's heart.
