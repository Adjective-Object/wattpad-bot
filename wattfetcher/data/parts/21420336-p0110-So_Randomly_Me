Things I hate about insta:
1. People complain so much
"And my I phone 6 is the wrong color so imma kill Myself."
2. So apparently insta isn't very careful checking which pages should be on
((Thanks Instagram for making me want to kill myself, you should make sure people who post nudes aren't allowed))
Anyways
So someone followed me and I was like "oh how nice"
I always check pages before following back
It was nudes
All nudes
I started bawling
I MEAN SERIOUSLY CRYING MY EYES OUT
I DONT EVER
EVER
EVER
WANT TO SEE
ANYONE NAKED
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN NAKEDNESS
LET ME TELL YOU I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHY PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SEX AND WANT TO SEE PEOPLE NAKED
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE NONE OF THAT SHOULD EVEN MATTER
Gods I am confusing
Anyways sorry
I've had a horrible day
And that just ruined it
And I couldn't talk to my mom
Because she's at work
And everyone else is busy
Gods dangit
