"You taste like candy" he whispered "I smell your arousal" he growled and he kissed down my body. I moan slipped out my.mouth and he smiled against my skin. "I'm going to take you 24/7 " my face flushed.
He started to unbutton my pants, he stopped and growled sitting up. I whimpered with disapproval. He smiled down at me licking his lips. "I'll get you soon". My body became aroused at the thought.
"Get in here you son of a bitch" he growled. Scott stepped in glaring at the other man.
"Kent get your ass off him" he hissed. So his name was Kent. Kent laughed and kissed my stomach.
"He moaned in pleasure and arched into my kisses, he actually whimpered when I stopped." Scotts glare hardened.
"Why are you.with him?" Scott turned to me a hurt look on his face.
"I woke up here and this escalated." I didn't have an answer.
"I'll finish you later ok" kent grumbled. I blushed as he got off the bed and shoved past his brother.
"Horny whore" scott mummered after he left. Haha scared much?
"Scott I'm so-" he cut me off with a growl.
"Save it" my eyes widened. It wasn't mt fault, my body acted on instinct. A piece of my heart broke...but I felt my body leaning towards kent.
"Fine I like kent anyway" I was shocked at my.own words. It caused scott to shudder a little. I guessed in anger. He let out a growl antld stalked out.
"What are you a dog" I hissed after him, he ignored my comment. I was alone in the room but sleep quickly made its self known. I took a breath and let sleep take over. I'll take care of the lost puppy later.
