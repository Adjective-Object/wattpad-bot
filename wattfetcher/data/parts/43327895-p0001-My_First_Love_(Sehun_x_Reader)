~(Y/n)'s P.O.V~
"Uggghh..." I sighed quietly as I sat in my seat by the window. Why don't they get a room. I glanced at the couple in the front of the class eating each others face. "Ahem..." I tried getting their attentions, but failed so I said it louder. "AHEM!" Finally noticing me, they pulled apart and glared at me. "Can you go to another class? This one is occupied!" The girl splat. "Uh..no.. This is my homeroom. Why don't you go somewhere else? People doesn't want to look at you two eating each others face off. Especially me." I glared at her harder. She just scoffed and walked off with her partner,saying something along the lines "She's just jealous because she's lonely" I laughed a bit at her comment. I know that, you don't have to remind me.
I just sat there enjoying the peace and quiet. After a while the students started walking in one by one, sometimes in a group chatting away. Eventually the bell rang signaling class had began and the other students in the halls ran to their classes.
I heard a lot about a new student coming into class 2-A, which is my class. The girls gossiping about how 'Hot' the new student is, so I suppose its a boy. Really? That's all they're talking about? How a guy is 'soooo hot'? Hah.. It's stupid how they focus on a guys' look more than their stu- My thoughts were interrupted by the teacher yelling "ALRIGHT CLASS! WE HAVE A TRANSFER STUDENT FROM NURI HIGH SCHOOL" I heard a couple of girls squealing and whispering to their friends once the teacher said 'Transfer student'. "PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF SIR!" The teacher gesture towards the door. The door opened to only reveal a handsome, beautiful man. Holy.. He's ho- NO (Y/N) YOU HATE GUYS! "Hello...I'm Oh Sehun. You can call me Sehun.." He waved and smiled gently.Some of the girls fainted while others squealed even louder.
"You can take your seat behind to (Y/n). (Y/n) please raise your hand " I heard the teacher say. I simply raised my hand. After a few seconds I put my hand down. I could feel some girls death glaring at me, but I didn't care.
I heard some shuffling behind me so I decided to check if the new student needed something. He was digging in his backpack looking for a pencil, after a while he gave up. I giggled at his action. I grabbed a pencil from my pencil box and placed it on his desk. He looked at me curiously, but I just smiled a bit and paid my attention to the board. Why do I feel so happy? Why is my heart beating so fast?! WHAT IS THIS FEELING?! Those thoughts kept running around in my head until I came to a conclusion.............Am I in love?!............End of Chapter 1- The New Student--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Haaaai!
