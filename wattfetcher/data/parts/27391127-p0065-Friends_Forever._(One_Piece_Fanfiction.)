"Why did you lock the door?"Law asked. The only answer he got were devious faces smiling at him.

Then from a girly scream was heard. Everyone barely able to contain their laughter when that same voice screamed, 'spiders!' and the screaming and cracks of lightning were heard before the door fell down.

The room resounded with the laughter of obnoxious teens and some even rolled on the floor.

"USOPP! I.WILL.KILL.AND.MURDER.YOU!" Haruka shouted his face completely red from embarrassment. "THE ENTIRE ROOM WAS COVERED IN FUCKING SPIDERS!"
"Your language." Aya reminded slapping him.
"Thanks for the idea, Sakura."
"Anytime."
"SAKURA, I WILL EXECUTE YOU!"

"Anyways, back to the game." Sakura answered. It was Nami's turn.
"Aya, truth or dare!"
"Dare!"
"I dare you to kiss Law."
0////0---> "What?"
"No way. I don't wanna do that. I mean, of course, I mean I don't want to do that." Aya said, shaking her head and blushing like a tomato.
"You didn't let me finish. Just on the cheek."
"Okay." Aya answered softly. She leaned with the intent of a peck on his cheek. Aya then felt a push and she fell ontop of Law meaning.....

A full kiss on the lips. Aya's face turned red and Law's one was not as red.  They quickly parted and Aya was saying 'gomenasi' repeatedly. Everybody took this well expect for one person.
"YOU BASTARD! HOW DARE YOU RUIN AYA-CHAN'S INNOCENCE! I'LL MAKE YOU BREAD FOR  THE REST OF YOUR STAY! DO YOU KNOW WHAT BREAD IS IN FRENCH?! IT'S PAIN!  PAIN I TELL YOU!"
"Great idea." Nami whispered to Sakura.
"Anytime." Sakura whispered.
"Oi Saki-ya, did you plan this?" Law asked, noticing the weird conversation.
"Maybe." Sakura winked.
"Sakura!" Aya yelled, still deep in embarrassment.
"Okay, my turn. Sakura, truth or dare."
"Dare anyday."
"You have to spend 10 minutes handcuffed to Sanji." Haruka stated, with a smirk. You see the colour drain from Sakura.
"Don't worry, Saki-chan. Its only ten minutes." Luffy encouraged.
"Of course, where are you getting the handcuffs?"
"Here you go." Law answered giving Sakura a pair of Sea Prism Handcuffs using his nodachi.
"WHY THE HELL DO YOU CARRY SEA PRISM HANDCUFFS ON YOU?" Sakura asked.
"In case of an emergency."
"Some emergency."

Sakura calmly took her seat between Zoro and Sanji.
