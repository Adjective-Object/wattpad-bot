Dear Charlotte,
I know we haven't talked in a while (2 years just about), but I have something important to tell you. Self-discovery isn't the easiest thing in the world. I, myself, thought that if I was gay, people would love me and I'd be cool. To this day, I still think that that's the only reason I feel this way. No, I'm not gay. I'm Bisexual. There's a difference. And for once I don't feel this way just because someone else does. This past year, I've thought a lot about my sexuality and who I am as a person. I've said I was a lot of things. I even did something insane, but I won't go into detail. After all my thought I realize I wanted to have a fairytale romance. I wanted the picket fence, I wanted the soccer games, I wanted the ballet recitals, I wanted a family. But I just didn't care with whom. I didn't care if my future spouse was a boy or a girl. I just wanted it. For once in my life I know who I am. I know what I want. I know what I want for the future. The next step is getting it out. I don't know who to tell. I'm afraid to tell. My mom will say that I'm too young to know something as big as this and my dad...I won't even get started. Everyone I know...my relationships would be corrupted. All I need to know is which one has more value? My family and friends, or freedom?
Yours eternally,

AN: Okay first letter, very short, very simple, very emotional. Not really but it's decent. For all those struggling with this certain problem I'll tell you this. It'll all be okay.
