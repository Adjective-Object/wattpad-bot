as the room was filled with silence all i could hear were the sounds of me typing,her breathing and my brother talking.
we glanced at eachother smiling weardly as we listened to bryan then went back to what we were doing.
she groaned as she sat up,"lets edit this photo!lets get creative!"she said quoting 'dont hug me im scared.'i smiled at her and shook my head.i spoke up saying,"theres this...umm.."
i snapped my fingers trying to remember what the video was,"this video i found."
,"took you hard enough"i pouted.looking at her phone i asked ,"Whos that?"she shrugged,"dont know, just enhanc-not enhancing-editing the photo"she said correcting herself.
she started talking more about the photo but i was to buissy trying to find the video on youtube.
