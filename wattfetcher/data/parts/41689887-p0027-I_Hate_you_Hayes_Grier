Hayes walked in too, and I walked upstairs when I closed the door Hayes crashed his lips on mine, he went down to my neck, I pulled him back up to my lips, "Mm-I love you." I heard him say against my lips, "I love you to-o." I stutter he picked me up behind my thighs and squeezed my butt I gasped and he shoved his tongue in.
"Hayes." I say, he walks into the bathroom and I lean down to start to the water I don't pull away he sits me on he counter I move my flat iron. He groans, and we finally pull away. "Nice way of letting your tongue enter my mouth." I smirked he blushed.
I take a shower and wash my hair. I spend about ten minutes in the shower then dry off, I forgot my clothes so I walk out with a towel wrapped around me. I get underwear, a bra, leggings, and a sweater.
I walked back in the bathroom and put on my clothes I brushed my teeth, and walked out. I put on a pair of crazy socks and walk downstairs.
I open the door to see they were roasting marshmallows, "Keegan you have something right there." Cameron said, I wiped off my face, "No right there." he said wiping a melted marshmallow on my face.
"You are so lucky I didn't wash my face yet." I said putting my hair in a high ponytail. I walk into the house washing my face, in the kitchen, when I dried my face, I turn around to see Hayes.
"Shi* you scared me." I said jumping back, "I'm sorry babe." Hayes said I blushed kissing him again, "You really want that to happened again?" He asked, "Ha your right!" I chuckled, I get a ton of notifications from YouTube, "Cameron did you post that?" I asked he nodded, "I love you." I said he smiled I bit his cheek, "Ow why?" He laughed asking, "Pay back time." I said Hayes chuckled.
Hayes's mom calls him, she tells him it's time for him to go home and that sky misses him.
We walk inside he hands me his phone really quick change my emoji to 😏😍😘❤️💯🙈😊yeah a lot but who cares, he changes mine from Hayes to Hot stuff with 😏❤️😍💯 after it.
"I'll see you tomorrow, please wear a dress and heels to the dance." Hayes begged me, "Fine but this is only for you." I said, he laughed and hugged me. "I don't want you to leave." I whined, "I have to my mom is gonna flip." he said I nodded then kissed him, "I love you." he said, "I love you too." I said he kissed me again but longer.
I bite my lip when he closed the door, I walk to my room and opened my balcony. "I love you Keegan!" Hayes shouts, "I love you too Hayes!" I shout back.
He closes his door, shutting the curtains, I do the same and lay on my bed then get a text from Hayes.

I fall asleep, Shutting my phone off putting it on the charger.
