D: oi bitch!
P: hey there :3
D: are you not in any way affected because i called you a bitch?
P: nope! :3
D: why?
P: because we both know i'm not the bitch here. ;3
D: shut up ok
P: neeeeevvvvveeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr >:3
D: there was a reason i texted you.
P: is it something about your dads or about....... that incident?
D: a little bit of both.
P: well, tell me then
D: ok. first thing: i'm getting a little sister!
P: omg!!!! congrats!!!!! ^_^
D: and second thing: my dads had 'the talk' with me the day after that incident....
P: really?
D: yeah and they asked me if i was gay or bi so then i explained how i want to pretend to be straight because of my fear of judgement so i told them that they didn't have to worry about anything.
P: how is that pretending your straight thing going btw?
D: not very well. people are starting to see through my facade.
P: just come out then
D: but that's too much effort and i'm too lazy to do it.
P: just kiss me in front of everyone and that will prove your point.
D: okay. don't expect me to not pull you somewhere afterwards.
P: you are just a horndog aren't you? ;3
D: you made me this way :p
P: that i did ;3
