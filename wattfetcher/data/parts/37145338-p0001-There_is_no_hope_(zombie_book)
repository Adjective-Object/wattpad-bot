I jumped on my skat board and road home. from an 8 hour day at school. I put my board in the back of the yard so dad won't snap it in half. I slowly walked to the door to hear my stupid drunk abusive father who beat me or mum and leaves to go sleep with a slut, at the bar. I hear my mum crying for him to stop as I burst through the door to see my father hitting my mum in the gut and her with a bloody nose. "leave her alone u jack" I knew that I would so regret that latter, I saw my mum look at my with pride and worry. she knew that he would beat me and she could not help I told her not to, i help her not the other way around. He slowly walked over to me with balled fists "what did u just say" he dares me I speak I am so stuiped I do anyway "I told to leave her alone u JACK!!!" I yelled in his face "that is it" he said almost hitting me "yes it is" I say through gritted teeth I am done with him he smirked and I doughed the hit and hit him in the gut. he grunts "are u proud daddy I learned how to fight like u" I glare at him "yes very" I was surprised he took me off guard and hit me in the face I stood there as I felt blood hit my lip an he hit me again and again tell I had blood down to my neak. I know I know that I should be telling him off but it is weird because me and him are really close and he is helping me fight it is just that I love him .... and when he beats me I shut off my feeling so I don't remember or I don't feel it I just stand there and fight my.....dad???
