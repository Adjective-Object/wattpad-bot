So I went over to my Grandma's on my dad's side of the family and she's is a very big Christian. I'm not saying I'm not a Christian, I am. But she takes it to a whole new level. I ended up staying the night and it's not a secret that I write books about werewolves and vampires and stuff like that. (I bet you see where this is going.)
She called me into her room and guess what she said. Go ahead guess.
"I want you to quit writing about fantasy and write about God." This isn't her exact words, but it's what she was getting at.
I swear! Who does she think she is?! That was totally uncalled for! I told my mom, I tell my mom everything that gets on my nerve. (You have to get it out somewhere.) And she told me to keep doing what I'm doing and that there's million of ways of being holy. Like this one country singer, he or she (I have no idea who it was this was her example) gives a homeless person a house at each city he (or she) goes to.
But I'm still annoyed about what my grandma said. -_-


Moral of the story: Do what you love.
