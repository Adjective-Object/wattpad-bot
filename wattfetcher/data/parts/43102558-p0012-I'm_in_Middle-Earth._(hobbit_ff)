Michelle's Dream....
We were in Rivendell. I ran up to Fili. Tears fell down my face. My heart ached badly. I fell to my knees. Fili held me close to him. I noticed that I was much taller. My ears were pointed. I had the features of an elf. My hair longer than before. "Thorin hates me because I'm an elf." I cried. Fili stroked my hair.
"Please don't hate me." I begged.
"I could never hate you. I don't care that you are an elf. You are still the Michelle I fell in love with." Fili smiled.
Fili wiped away my tears. I was still on my knees. I stared into Fili's eyes. He leaned forward and kissed me.
End of Dream....
I woke up in someone's arms. Thorin was still sound asleep. Gandalf was the only one awake. I walked over to him and sat down. Gandalf was smoking a pipe. "Are you alright?" Gandalf asked. I shook my head.
"I'm in love with Fili and Thorin. The night I first met Thorin, I had a dream. We were tracked by wargs. One jumped at Thorin, but I pushed Thorin it of the way. I got scratched and bitten. We got to Rivendell. I spoke some elvish before I fell to the ground from the loss of blood. I had a dream just now. We were still in Rivendell. I was a full elf. I ran up to Fili in tears because Thorin found out what I was and hated me. Fili and I formed a relationship after that." I sighed.
"Ah. They are visions not dreams. You have the gift of foresight like your half brother." Gandalf chuckled.
"Blake has foresight?"
"No not him. I mean Lord Elrond of Rivendell. You and Elrond have the same elven mother but different fathers. When his father died, his mother found your father. She died giving birth to you. Your father was devastated. He moved away leaving you in Rivendell. Blake's and Haley's mother brought them to Rivendell to protect them from their fathers. Blake is the other son of King Thranduil while Haley is the daughter of a dunedain. Elrond had a vision that all three of you were destined to help Middle-Earth with this quest. Elrond had you, Blake, and his half sister sent to earth until you three were ready to come back. Since you know about my plan to get you to Rivendell." Gandalf explained.
"So I'm not related to either of them."
"No you are not."
"How will we tell them?"
"We already know." Haley and Blake said in unison.
"It's cool that you can have visions." Blake smiled
"Let's just wake the others." I sighed.
