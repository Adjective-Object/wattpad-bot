"GET BACK HERE YOU BITCH!" screamed delirious through his mic, his GTA 5 character chasing me down the streets.
"noooo you will just kill me again asshole!" I said back, holding my laughter back and running round the corner waiting for him to follow.
"damn right I will" he said turning the corner and saw me and an RPG heading strait for his face
Delirious was killed my Vannos came up in the chat and I laughed at him "hahaha! Revenge bitch!"
"don't laugh at meeeee" he mumbled but that just made me laugh even more at him. "hey Evan, its getting late I think Im gunnu head off now okay?" he says through a yawn.
"yeh no problem Del, talk to you tomorrow or something yeh?"
"Yeh sounds good, night Evan"
"night Del"
Delirious has left the skype
*sigh* "....love you"
