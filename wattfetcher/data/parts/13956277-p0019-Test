I stood there quiet for 3 minutes
"Earth is calling Leena" He waved in front of my face
"Ok" I put my right then left foot in his enormous nike shoese, he seems rich haha
"You can take mine" I joked as I passed my shoese to him
"No thanks, I rather walking barefoot than walking in some ripped baby-shoese" He giggled
"Whatever, Come on, It's getting late" We started running again
"Tell me about your-beautiful-self a bit" he said out of nowhere
"Listen to me Kitty (you know tom and Jerry right? haha I'm hilarious, sorry) I'm Only talking to you a bit because you're taking me home, we are not friends or anything else and I will NOT talk to you or walk with you ever again! Get it ? what happened today means nothing, we are not even friends and wont be, Just thank you for helping me but don't talk to me" I said while breathing rapidly
"Kitty ha ? You gave me a nickname" He smirked
"Astaghferoka Ya allah"
mind: Why don't you call Elina ? maybe she'll pick up now
me: Oh Thank you !!!! first time you help me! I don't want to replace you anymore
mind: You owe me a favor
I pulled my phone and dialled her number
"WHERE ARE YOU" She screamed through the phone
"You're the one who left me alone to go with your stupid boyfriend so I walked alone and got lost"
"I'm sorry, Where are you? we'll come to pick you up"
"you better be" I searched for a sign and found one
"24th street in front of a red building"
"That's near, I'll be there in 10 minutes" She hung up
"Too bad, fun has just begun" Tom said sadly and I ignored him
I sat on the pavement and he did too but 10 feet away from me.
We sat in silence for 15 minutes until I noticed a black fimilliar car
"here they are ... uh, thank you Tom, and sorry for being rude, As-salamu Alaykom" It was rude of me not to thank him, yes he was rude and annoying but at least he wanted to help me and protect me.
"You're welcome, Your number please?" He smirked
"haha not even in your dreams"
Mrs.Carter's car stopped in front of me
"Lenaaaa I almost died of worry" Elina jumped out the car and hugged me
"You Okay?" Damon asked from the driver's seat and I nodded
"Hey Damon" Tom waved at Damon
"Oh hey" Damon got out and give him a man-hug
"What Are you doing here" Damon asked
"Well, because your sister left me alone and I wasn't gonna walk home with you even If you were the last person on earth, I decided to go back alone, and I got lost and Tom found me and offered help" I answered for Tom
"Oh, well come on before the food gets cold, Mom made some meat" Damon said
What if it wasn't a Halal meat?
"Uh no thanks Im not hungry I just need to sleep" I got in the back seat while Damon and his sister got in the front.
