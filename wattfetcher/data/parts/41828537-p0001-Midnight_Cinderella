As I'm walking down the stairs, everyone is looking at me like I'm some kind of freak.
I was about to walk away, someone held me back and everyone gasped.
" Please don't leave." He takes my hand walks down with me. It's the prince! I thought as if there was something wrong with it.
No way a maiden like me would be ever chosen by the prince. What would he think if he sees me in the woods?
" Know the reason why I chose you?" I shook my head indicating a no.
" Because when I first saw you in the bakery, I thought that you were beautiful person I have ever seen."
" Prince! Why did you chose her? She is just a maiden?"
He kept silence to that person and just focus his eyes on me. His eyes sparkled with happiness and delight.
" It's because she isn't no ordinary maiden. She is my maiden."
My heat skipped a beat when he said I was his maiden.
********Why did he have to choose me? I still have the question running through my head a million times, when I returned to the bakery.
" My, my, darling where have you been? I have been worried sick!"
" Dad! I was only out for the ball I got invited to."
" Okay. Well goodnight honey."
" Goodnight."
