Erin's POV
Jordan took Boo and I to a park. First thing Boo did was run to the playground and go down the slide.
"Thank you, Jordan." She said.
"Oh, you're welcome." He said back.
We sat at a picnic table across from each other and got out the lunch we packed.
"What'd you pack for me?" Boo asked.
"I brought peanu budda and jelly." Jordan said with an attempt of a new yorker accent.
"Ha, Jordan." I said with silent "I love you" at the end.
"Yay!" Boo screamed jumping up and down.
I moved so I was next to Jordan and attempted to hug him but failed because of my broken arm.
"You okay?" He asked.
"Yeah, I just need some huggin' and lovin'." I said.
"What's up?" He asked.
"I just -- last night, I've been thinking about it since it happened." I said after Boo ran off to play.
"Look, I -- don't worry about it. It's fine, and you had just broke your arm like... four hours before." He said looking at my arm and hugging me tighter.
"I just feel like some of the things I said were the wrong things to say." I said.
"Oh, like what?" He said as if I didn't say anything wrong but I could still see through the act. He was upset about it.
"Come on, like I can't tell you're upset." I said as if I were upset also, which I was.
"I'm not, I'm -- a little bit." He said.
"I'm sorry, babe."
"You know what? Let's not let this mess up our lunch time here. We'll eat and then we'll be happy and it won't mess everything up." He said with much enthusiasm.
"Good idea, we'll do that. I love you." I said.
"I love you." He said.
"Oh my god!" We heard a young girl scream from across the park.
"Who was that? Was that Boo? Who was that?" He said frantically looking around.
I laughed. "That wasn't Boo, it didn't sound like her, and she doesn't say god." I said.
"Oh my god." The girl said as she walked up to our table getting teary eyed.
