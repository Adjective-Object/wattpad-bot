My vision is blurry, but I can make out that I'm staring at the sidewalk. As I assess the situation further, I realize that Jeff is carrying me over his shoulder. It's night time, no one is out on the streets.
"Jeff, she's awake." Toby notices.
Jeff gently sets me down on the ground. My head is pounding. I touch it and whimper. "Hey, are you okay?" Jeff asks in a soft voice. I haven't heard him speak like this before, it's strange.
"Yeah.. just a headache." I nod as he helps me.
"Well I hit you in the head with a lamp." He says. "Sorry about that by the way."
"It's okay," I smile. "I don't know what came over me."
"I do."
"Soo if you guys are done with your so obvious flirting," Toby says, annoyed. "I was wondering where we will be staying on this trip."
"Motel. We'll pay with cash, Toby and I will do a sweep before we leave." Jeff answers.
"A sweep?" I ask.
"Yeah," Toby answers me. "Like we'll make sure all evidence of us being there is erased. Security camera tapes, any logs they keep of guests who stay there, stuff like that." He cracks his neck.
"Why not just sign in under a fake name?" I ask.
"Oh we do. But it's just to take precaution." Toby says.
"You and Toby will check in, then sneak me in through the window." Jeff tells me.
"Why can't you check in with us?"
He looks at me. "Not a lot of people consider this trustworthy." He points to his face.
"Oh." I say quietly. As soon as I have nothing to distract me, my headache returns quite strongly. "Oh my god." I say, stopping my walking.
"What's wrong?" Jeff asks looking at me with concern.
"My head. I can't walk anymore it's getting worse." I say, holding my head.
"Could I carry you?" Jeff asks.
"I'm pretty heavy, Jeff. I don't want you to hurt yourself." I say.
Toby and Jeff both laugh. Jeff picks me up bridal style. I want to protest but I know I'm really weak and this is probably my best option at this point.
I wrap my arms around his neck and nuzzle my head into his chest.
"Damn you were right about you being heavy. Fatass." Jeff teases.
I slap the back of his head, instantly regretting it. But he doesn't snap. He doesn't even get angry. He laughs and continues to carry me as we walk.
"Hey I have some Advil on me if you think that will help." Toby offers.
"Yeah, thank you." I smile and hold out my hand. He opens up a bottle and gives me two pills. I swallow them both and close my eyes.
"Goodnight sleepy head." Jeff says laughing a bit.
I laugh too and slowly fall asleep as Jeff carries me.
