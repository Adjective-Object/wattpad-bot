I always loved him. He is my #1 Favorite Warrior Cat. If you don't know why, its because I feel sympathy for him. He would have been the greatest warrior if Thistleclaw hadn't have corrupted him. Imagine if he had...like...Thrushpelt or someone as a mentor? He would have been a great deputy and leader! But Fireheart had to become leader :P....
