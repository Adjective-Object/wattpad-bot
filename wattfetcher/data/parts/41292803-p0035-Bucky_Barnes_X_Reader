Someone was brushing my hair away from my face with a cool hand. It felt good on my hot skin. My entire body ached. My eyelids fluttered open. Bucky looked so worried.

I had to wait until you were awake to start. He said. Pain filling his eyes.

Start what? I said through broken lips.

Patching you up. He replied.

Don't bother. I don't deserve it.

Shh. Now here is what I am going to do. Show me where you were hurt.

My ribs, shoulders, head, and hand.

He gently lifted my shirt. His eyes begged my forgiveness as he gently probed the swollen areas.

At least three, maybe more, broken. I am going to set it, but you are going to have to not pass out ok?

He squeezed my hand then, it began.
