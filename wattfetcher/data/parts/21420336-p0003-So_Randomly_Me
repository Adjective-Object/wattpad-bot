So have you ever done something nice for someone and then regretted it :(
I just did today.
My sisters wanted to sleep over at my cousins house and they couldn't because the room wasn't clean.
Me, being the awesome demigod I am, offered to clean the room for them.
I have no idea what happened to me at that moment I just said it. Like I didn't even WANT to say that.
But I did and then I wasn't allowed to go to the sleepover because I had to clean, so now I'm alone at home....
FML
XD
So
I'm
Bored
And
I
Want
Blood Of Olympus
To
Be
Out
Already
Don't
You?
I have a list of who I think will die!
1) Percy
Well, I think he will die either protecting Annabeth or Nico. I mean those are like the best people ever. And who wouldn't die for Nico!?
2) Nico
If percy dies, Nico will mostly do the Soul For A Soul thingy. But I doubt he will die cuz who kills someone who's been through so much it's like saying,"Oh hey your life sucks? Oh don't worry it's gonna get worse and you will die at the end!!"
That's not what people do, only I'm allowed to crush people's dreams.
3) sadly
Frank
The stick people the stick.
NUFF said
Yeah idk
BUT OMG I HAVE AN IDEA
SO WHAT IF EVERYONE GOOD LIVES BUT LIKE YOU KNOW HOW RICK SAID THAT 5 PEOPLE WILL DIE?! Or something like that
WHAT IF HE MEANT 5 BAD PEOPLE OoO
Nico needs a boyfriend or girlfriend
I volunteer as tribute.
I want to go into an elevator full of people one day and say,"I know your all wondering why I gathered you all here."
Then everyone's just gonna be like,"O.o?!?"
And then I'm gonna burst out laughing saying,"ITS CAUSE WE ARE FAMILY EVEN IF YOUR BETTER THAN ME!!"
And run out of the elavator.
