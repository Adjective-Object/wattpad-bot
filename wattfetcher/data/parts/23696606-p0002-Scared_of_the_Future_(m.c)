As soon as I walked into the coffee-shop the next morning, I was met with the delightful smell of newly brewed coffee. I had a new book in my hands this time, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky.
I sat down at my usual spot, like I've done every day for the past month. But today, it felt somewhat different. I felt excited. I was excited. To see Michael again.
It was weird, feeling such a strong connection towards a complete stranger. Well, maybe not stranger,  but the only things I knew about him was that his name was Michael, he works in a small-town coffee-shop, he watches Supernatural and he has a great taste in books.
Last night, Michael had texted me almost immediately after i entered my apartment. He asked if he had gotten the right number. I replied with calling him, which led to talking on the phone until 1 A.M.
I smiled at the thought, and opened the book I had read so many times before.
"August 25 1991
Dear Friend,
I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to-" I snapped my head up as I heard the doorbells ring, signaling that someone was entering the shop. I swear I could feel my heart skip at beat when I saw Michael walking in. He wore a Def Leppard shirt with a red flannel over it. He had black boots and black skinny jeans with a hole in the left knee.
"Hey Lilith!" he waved at me and smiled. He took is green apron of the rack before putting it on and making his way towards me.
"Hey Michael." I smiled widely at him as he sat down on the chair in front of me. "You're late today" I teased him and he rolled his eyes at me. "Yeah, right. I guess that's the price I have to pay for talking to a pretty girl all evening:" He winked at me, making me blush and look down at the book, playing with the pages. " ' The Perks of Being a Wallflower'? Wow, your books are just getting more and more depressing." he said as he grabbed it from my hands and put it aside.
"Stop saying that! Like I told you, they aren't depressing, the-" "They're deep, yada yada. No, they're depressing, end of story." he cut me of, trying to look serious, but failing as a smile cracked the surface.
"What can I do to prove otherwise?" I challenged him, raising an eyebrow at him. "Well," he started, lifting up a finger. "There happens to be a movie of the book, If I'm correct. When I finish my shift at 5 P.M, we will go buy the movie and then watch it at my place. Kapeesh?"
I nodded. "I kapeesh. But waiting 10 hours? I don't know, I'll miss you too much" I said in a "whining-baby" voice, fake frowning. "I know you'll miss me. I mean, C'mon, I'm awesome" he pointed at himself, and we both laughed.
"Yes, you are. So, I'll meet you here at 5?" I picked up my book and got off the chair. I slipped m y coat coat on and put the book in my pocket. "Yeah, sounds good," he agreed, before getting up as well. "Wait, you're leaving already?" Michael looked a little disappointed. "Yeah, sorry. I've got a meeting with my landlord, and I need to clean my apartment. It's a mess." We laughed a little, but the disappointment was still visible on his face. I walked over to him, standing on my toes and giving him as kiss on the cheek. "Bye Michael, see you later." I smiled at him before heading for the door. "Bye Lilith..." he muttered, and right before exiting, I swear I could hear him whisper, "be safe."
