"Are you Okay Leena ?" Oh I shouldn't have asked ... Damon came running, where's he when I'm in a desperate need for him ?
"I saw somebody run but I wasn't fast enough to get out in the perfect time" He's just a chicken.
"I- I'm reall-" Damon was cut off by his phone.
"I should pick up" He answered and got in the house.
"Such a gentleman ... leaves me and my injured body to answer his phone" Elina laughed at me words, "Jerk" She said "Can you walk ?" I tried to stand up "Just give me your hand" Elina guided me to the living room.
"Yes sir, its all Oka- Oh yeah babe talk yo you later" Damon hung up when he noticed our presence, "Who was that ?" Elina asked "A friend of mine, I'll go get Leena some ice"
I didn't concentrate on Elina and Damon's conversation, I felt that someone is still staring at me, I was nervous.
"Mawlaya salli wa sallim ..." I heard the nasheed I had put as a ring-tone long time a go playing loudly.
"Can you get me my phone please" Elina ran and got it. It's mom, weird, she hasn't called in a long time.
"Assa-
"Hey dear, are you Okay ?" I felt huge worry dripping from her tone.
"Yes mom I- hold on, how did you know I'm not Okay ?" Just how ?
"U-um babe its the mother's heart that tells" I giggled at how serious she sounded, "I just tripped" We kept the conversation going for about 10 minutes, I fought to keep my voice normal while my cut head and almost broken leg were killing me, mom gave the phone to my father and he was angry because I jumped out of the window ... you can't blame him because I didn't tell him the whole truth, maybe mom's heart might figure the whole thing out.
I sat on the couch watching Pretty little liars, who doesn't like this show anyway ? I removed the cup of ice Damon has given to me because it was such a stupid idea to put a thick plastic cup that doesn't pass the coldness of the ice to my leg, but I didn't want to disappoint him because he was trying to help me, though his help was useless.
I stared at Elina who was flirting shamelessly with her Lewis on the phone, and Mrs.Carter was with Mr.Carter of the phone too WHATS WRONG WITH THIS FAMILY ? But there was Damon, sat on the kitchen table because he hates chairs ... I know, he's weird. Damon was whispering on the phone but all I managed to hear was "Im sorry, I wont let that happen again sir, our agreement is still on" Who is he talking to ?
My buzzing phone interrupted me. 1 new message *click*,
Unknown number
Just have some rest and put some ice and change the bandage on your head, its about to rot cuppycake *kiss*
Ps : Even if I spend all my money over you, you're worth it cuppycake, plus, Ice in plastic cups is BS *wink*
Be aware of Damon.
I stared at my phone with my jaw on the floor beside my widened eyes, Be aware of Damon ... What is that supposed to mean ???
For the first time I felt .... Scared,because I was sure that ....
I'm being watched.
