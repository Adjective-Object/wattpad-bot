Okay I know I already used Michelle in another fanfic but hey I've always wanted to write a love story between me and Q so I'm not going to use a random name... But this is the last time I'll use Michelle!* *But I might as like a background characterðŸ˜„*MICHELLE'S P.O.V.
I gnawed on the end of my pen, worried sick about Benny. Benny is a handsome young mix puppy who just can't seem to eat enough. If Benny doesn't start with a normal diet soon... They'll say he can't survive... And put him to sleep.
I choked back the lump in my throat. I can't stand animals in pain, which is why I became a veterinarian. To help animals out of pain. I sighed and ran a hand through my limp, brown hair.
I'm 32, and I live alone, so you can basically guess how many nice guys come knocking down my door. I have my best friend, and my only friend, Robyn who visits everyday, and I enjoy the company.
I have brown hair cut just above my shoulder blades and I have boring brown eyes. I can't help but feel wrong, but I admit I can't help but feel envy when I look at Robyn with her long auburn hair that glistens and her beautiful blue eyes that just make people drop what they're doing and stare.
I put my pen down and slowly packed my things. I finally closed my drawer and felt someone watching me. I turned to see my partner, Jake Murphy, watching me while leaning against the doorframe.
"May I help you, Jake?" I asked politely. Jake raised a hand. "No, no. I'm good. Just- it's two hours after your hours are done and you're still here," Jake shrugged, nonchalantly.
I rolled my eyes. "I'm already on my way, Jake. Goodbye," I stood up straight and brushed past Jake. Don't get me wrong, I like Jake and all, but he can get a little... Nosey. He has sandy blonde hair that he takes hours on in the morning, grey eyes and light pink lips.
He's very attractive and all, just not the kind of guy who interests me.
Well who interests you, Micky Mouse? This is why you've had three boyfriends all your life, I thought to myself.
I rubbed my eyes and sighed loudly as I checked out of the office. I got into my car and drove home. Or- as close to home as I'll get. I live in one of those apartment buildings that have about thirty different people living in them.
It's nice and all, but it just never feels like an actual home, if you get me. I yawned and fumbled with my front door keys. I looked up at the ceiling above me.
No one has taken the apartment up there- the landlord claims it's been rented but the renter just hasn't finished packing. Well, I don't think it takes three years to pack as it's been empty three years.
I finally opened my door. Silence enveloped me and I took off my vets coat. I hung it on the rack and looked around. I trudged into the kitchen and opened my refrigerator to find half a can of tuna.
I took it out and called for my kitten, Prim. I've never understood why people give their pets odd names such as "fluffy" or "cuddles", I suppose they were named by children at the time.
I poured the tuna into Prim's bowl and refilled her water bowl. I took out a can of dry dog food and cooed for my German Shepard, Percy.
Percy and Prim ran out of my bedroom, nipping at each other's paws. Percy is very gentle with Prim while she basically attacks him about everyday.
Percy ran past his food and jumped at my legs. "Oh Percy! Who's a good boy?" I asked, affection dripping from my voice. Percy barked and left my side and went to his bowl. I laughed and dragged my legs to my bed.
The second my head had hit the pillow I was out like a light.
