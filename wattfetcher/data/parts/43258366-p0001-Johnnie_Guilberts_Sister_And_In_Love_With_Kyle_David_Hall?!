Katherine's POV
Hi im Katherine Carpenter, but I go as Katie. I have black hair and green-ish eyes with glasses and i am 15 years old. I was scrolling through instagram, when my mom called me into the living room. "Uhhh Katie I have something to tell you." "Ok?" "Ok im not your real mother-" thats when my whole world crashed down. "- umm that youtuber Johnnie Guilbert's mom is your mother and he's your brother." Im sitting there confused, in shock. "And they will be here in an hour to pick you up. So go pack your going to live in California with them." I get up and walk to my room to pack. All I have to pack is jeans, a bunch of pierce the veil shirts, a few other band tees, vans and converses, and different type of band merch. As I finished packing I graped my phone off the charger and headphones. I walk into the living room to see my favorite youtuber and his mom. I hide my fangirlyness in side really well. I smile a little bit at them. Johnnie runs up to me and hugs me. "I've missed you so much. I know you dont remember me but I've missed you." "Hi Johnnie... wait does this mean my name isnt Katherine Carpenter its Katherine Guilbert?!?" Johnnies mom just nods. I stiffen. "You're trying no to fangirl arent you?" Johnnie asks while laughing. I walk over to a piece of paper and write 'yes and im writing cause I dont trust my voice.' Johnnie laughs. "You have every thing packed dont you?" I nod. "Good cause you're coming on warped tour with me!" I can hold it back any more I scream and hug Johnnie. He laughs as I fip my hair after wards and say "Cool." "What type of bands do you listen to?" "Dont you dare get her started on that devil worshipping rock music!" My mom yells at Johnnie. "Well ok then." "Wait I need to get something." I said and to my room to get a hat with domo's face on it. "K you ready to go." I nod my head and we start to walk out the door...
