Blinking away the tears, he took Past (Name)'s hand and left the room, both of them feeling like their feet couldn't take them any further.

***LOST 2P! ROMANO AND 2P! SPAIN***

"I...can't believe this..." (Name) said under her breath. Feeling tears forming in the corner of her eyes. Luciano stayed silent, but he was obviously affected by the memory.
The scene changed into the room in the fourth floor that had a bed and a lever. It was the room above the piano room.
Just like how it was with the previous memories, this place was just as bloody.
Past Lutz and Past Kuro was laid on the bed, both of them badly bruised.

"Here you go. We retrieved the key." Past Lutz told them. He smirked as he threw the key at Past Luciano's direction, to which the Italian caught. Though he acted a bit cocky, Past Lutz couldn't deny that he was already weakened after loosing so much blood.
Tears continued to fall from Past (Name)'s eyes as she looked at the two bloodied Second Players. "...Why...why must everyone..."
"Don't shed tears for us. We're just that guy's henchmen." Past Kuro chuckled weakly. He didn't have the strength to sit up, but he was able to raise his hand slightly to point at Past Luciano, who was speechless at the moment.
Shaking her head, Past (Name) stood by their bedside. "No...you guys were more than that. You're his friends...We're...all friends... That's why...."
".....That's why you two should take that key and run to the door, for our sake." Past Lutz cut in.
Smirking, Past Kuro looked at Past Luciano, who stood there motionlessly. "Well, Luciano...It looks like we're going to retire now. Isn't...that right, Lutz?"
"....Ja.... It's time..." Past Lutz said softly.
As if Luciano was snapped back to reality, the Italian shook his head and spoke angrily. "You....You two....wouldn't dare!!" he warned.
"Hahah. We've got nothing left to lose, you...know..." Past Kuro whispered before he closed his eyes and...finally passed.
"K-Kuro!" Past Luciano shouted, rushing beside the Japanese man to shake him. It was no use.
Softly, Past Lutz muttered under his final breath, "Luciano...just go...Don't let our efforts go in vain..."
"No...No....Lutz!!" Past Luciano cried out as he shook the German's broad shoulders. He didn't move anymore. He didn't breath anymore. Neither Lutz or Kuro did.
They were gone.
Wiping the tears away, Past (Name) went beside Past Luciano to comfort him and calm him down. "...Luci...I'm so sorry...but..."
"(S-Second Name)! Can you believe it, these two bastards are slacking off again!" Past Luciano shouted, not believing what was happening. He couldn't take it.
