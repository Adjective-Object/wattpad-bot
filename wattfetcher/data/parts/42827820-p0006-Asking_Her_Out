"You got to do what!?" Lightning and Chicken asked after Scott had told them everything.
"I get to see her grampa tonight and her aunt and uncle tomorrow." Scott repeated.
"What are you gonna do about it?" Lightning asked then.
"Well, I dunno, it was your guys' idea!" Scott pointed to his best friends, defensively. "You got me into this mess, you get me out of it!"
"Well... You know, we could do a practice date." Chicken suggested.
"That sounds great, but how are we gonna get a girl without makin' Jade jealous 'bout it, bird brain?" Scott huffed.
"Just leave that to me." Chicken grinned, then laughed a bit.
Lightning laughed with him, then looked confused as usual. "Wait... Why are we laughin'?"
Chicken sighed.
Underneath shadow of the tree, Cindy was reading her novel by her favorite author.
"Oh, Ben Ravencroft," Cindy sighed dreamily about the author she strongly looked up to. "I wish I could meet you in person..."
"Hey, Cindy." Chicken greeted the girl.
Cindy was surprised, but smiled. "Oh, hey Chicken... Is there something you need?"
Chicken told Cindy the whole deal.
"So, you're telling me that you need a practice date?" Cindy asked, a little anxious.
"Yep." Chicken nodded.
"And that you want me to do it?"
"That's it."
Cindy shook her head. "Uh-uh... No way... I've never been on a date... Let alone a practice date... No, you can't make me do it."
Chicken gave her a look, he remembered how Cow would often blackmail him into doing stuff with her, but not as annoying as Sarah to Ed. "Yeah, I can." he then grinned to her.
"How?" Cindy raised a brow.
"I know about your Discord fan fiction!" Chicken bribed.
"How!?" Cindy got paranoid. "Did Duncan or Abby tell you!?"
"Never mind, I just know," Chicken ignored her question. "If you don't want anybody to know about it, then you got to help us."
"Fine, I guess I have no choice." Cindy sighed in defeat.
"And dress up."
"WHAT!?"
"Yeah, well, this is a practice date, that means youse gotta dress up... See ya in a few minutes."
Cindy sighed. "What did I just get myself into?" she murmured as she left to get changed.
