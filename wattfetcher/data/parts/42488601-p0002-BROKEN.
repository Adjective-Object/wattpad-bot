"So Maylem. Your wounds show obvious signs of abuse. You could have definitely been severely injured. As I was examining you, I noticed scars on your wrist." She stated. Kathy looked at me with sorrow filled in her eyes. "You have a sprained wrist, we'll give you a brace for that, umm...." She thought, as she looked down at her clipboard. "Mrs. Tuckerman will explain what will be happening." She said giving me a small smile before walking out of the house.
"You'll be released from the hospital tomorrow, but the police are coming to talk to you today. Either you chose to live with or you will live in a foster care." Kathy explained.
"What's gonna happen to her?" I inquired. "She'll most likely be arrested for child abuse." Kathy said, knowing who I was asking about.
"I think I want to go with you." I stated. "But I don't want to be a burden."
Kathy's eyes lit up with joy. "Trust me sweetie, you'll never be a burden. I really want to help."
"Alright. I want to go with you." I said.
"But one question."
"Yes?"
"Where do you live?"
"California."
