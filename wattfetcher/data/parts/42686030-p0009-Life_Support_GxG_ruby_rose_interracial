Aaleeyah raised an eyebrow " so? Girl move " she pushed past me " I came go spend time with you and I'm not leaving until I do." I blocked the stairs " but I'm kinda busy right now. So later? Yeah."   "Girl what the hell is wrong with you? Why you acting so suspicious....ooo you got somebody upstairs!" She pushed me down and ran upstairs I fell and got up chasing her but it was too late.
