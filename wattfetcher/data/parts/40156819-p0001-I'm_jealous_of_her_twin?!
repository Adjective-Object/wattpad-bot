Ugh...shota!!!Anyway my name is (Y/N) Kawaiichi yeah yeah yeah I'm cute n'all but sometimes it's annoying, cause people saying "aww you are so cute!!" "DATE ME 2nd GODDESS OF CUTENESS!!!!!!" 2nd one you ask?? Because my best friend Annika Aurani Dusk AKA Nika chan or USA chan cause of that big white bow on her head, and also because of her bubbly appearance is the #1 cute princess in the whole town...she is also really smart and...uh...oblivious and childish...As we walk in the school I see a crowd, and when there's a crowd there's an Annika. "Nika chan!!!!!" I yelled at her "kyaa!!! (n/n) chan!!! Help me!!!!" I nodded as I glared at the people then the paled a bit when they see me, then they turn to look at Annika...uh oh...she has that devil's aura again. Then she gave them her look-into-my-eyes-and-you'll-see-hell-and-satan-itself glare they suddenly scrambled away HAHAHAHA!!!!!! They're faces!!! Are!!! So!!! Hahaha Ridiculous!!!! "Nice job Annika" I smiled at her "You too~!!" She giggled "hey did you see that there are new students here today??" I asked "ugh no I haven-" "KYAAAA!!!!! They are soo cute!!!!!" "EEEEH???!!!!" We both exclaimed then we saw twins a blonde boy with blue eyes and his hair tied to a messy ponytail. Next was a girl similar to boy but with short yellow hair and a big white bow similar to mine and with clips. They see us and the boy suddenly blushes pure red when he saw Annika then the girl's eyes sparkled at me, then Annika and I exchanged glances "umm...?" We both said at the same time
