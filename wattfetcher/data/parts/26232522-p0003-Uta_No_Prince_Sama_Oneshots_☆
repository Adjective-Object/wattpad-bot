"I wanted to practice confessing."
You raised a bros at him. "You do know that you can confess to her without practicing."
He chuckled. "Practice makes perfect (First Name)."
You groaned. "Fine. But make it quick. We still need to memorize our lines."
------------------------------------------ â˜†
After you and Syo memorized your lines and helping him with his confessions (Ouch), you packed your things up and went to door.
"(First Name) wait." Syo called out as you looked behind. "What?"
He gave you a letter with a cute hat stamp on it. "What's this for?"
"Open it. You'll find it."
You curiously opened the letter. It contained 3 words.
You looked at Syo with your jaw hanging. He wasn't serious is he?!
"Look (First Name). I really like you. I know that love is forbidden for Idols like us and I couldn't take it anymore. I can't follow the same stupid rule all over again." He confessed.
You blinked twice until your face became red like a tomato.
"Stupid chipmunk" you mumbled as you hid the letter in your bag.
"So is it a Yes?" He asked.
You thought about it in your head for a few minutes until you finally came up with a good answer.
"Before that. I want you to memorize your lines by tomorrow and maybe I'll consider it." You said as you winked.
"I can do that (First Name). And besides, Practice makes perfect right?"
You giggled and went out of the building hand in hand with the blondie.
Well, guess all of those practice did make that confession perfect.
