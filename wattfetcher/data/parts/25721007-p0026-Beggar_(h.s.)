"Harry," I smile at the gorgeous curly-haired boy with sparkling, emerald eyes. Hopefully, he's not angry that I'm talking with Zayn. It's not his place to tell me what to do anyway.
"Can we talk?" Harry asks, but doesn't return the smile. I nod which gives Zayn the signal to leave. He enters his bedroom and closes the door to give us privacy.
"What's up? Is everything okay?" I question. Harry gestures me to sit down on the couch and I quickly oblige. I'm not quite sure what he wants to say, but I'm hoping it's good.
"I want to take you on a proper date before we move on. Since it is your birthday, I thought tonight would be the perfect night. What do you think?" he suggests. His gorgeous, curly locks run through his fingers, his feet rock back and forth waiting for my reply. I love how nervous he looks to ask me on a date, it's truly sweet.
"Of course, I would love that," I agree. Harry lets out a huge breath of air he must've been holding in.
"I'll text you the address. Meet me there at seven o'clock," he says and walks into his own bedroom, closing the door. I'm left alone on the couch with nothing but my thoughts.
I wasn't expecting Harry to ask me on a date tonight. I was expecting him to flip out on me because of Zayn. It seems like Harry and him are always pushing each other's buttons and fighting over me.
Waiting for tonight is like watching paint dry. Time is ticking by slower than ever. I ponder about what I should do to waste time. Then I remember the new camera Zayn gave me for my birthday.
I throw on my warmest jacket, pick up my camera, and walk out the door. As soon as I reach the outside, I'm met with a whirl of cold air. The streets of New York City are busy and bustling like always.
My finger hits the power button of my favorite device. I point the lens to a bunch of towering skyscrapers. Snow starts to fall adding to the image.

I've been outside walking around the gorgeous city of New York taking pictures for a few hours now. It's getting colder and colder the longer I spend out here.
I decide to stop at Starbucks to cure my need for warmth before going back to the apartment. They still haven't called me back about the job either which upsets me. The boys have done so much for me already and I've never gave them anything for it.
Once I reach the front of the line, I am greeted by a cute man about my age. He gives me my latte and I leave the building. My mind begins to wonder about Fawn. I remember when I saw her here not to long ago.
After twenty straight minutes of walking and sipping, I finally reach the place I've been calling home. I open the door and Louis, Liam, and Niall are standing there. They all shout 'happy birthday' to me in perfect unison.
"Thank you guys! I wasn't expecting that," I smile and laugh at the same time. I continue to walk to the bathroom until the voice of Niall stops me in my tracks.
"Wait, we all got you something," he says which makes me turn around. Liam hands me an envelope which reads Happy Birthday Lennon! on the front. I tear open the paper fold and two tickets to the Metropolitan Museum of Art are inside.
"Guys.." I manage to say note the water coming from my eyes, "This is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me, really. I always wanted to go here as a child and now, because of you three, I have the opportunity. Thank you!"
"It's nothing really. We got you two passes so you can take anyone you want or you could go twice," Louis chuckles, gesturing towards the torn package.
