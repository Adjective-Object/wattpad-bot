Hello, my dears! I could've sworn I updated just a few days ago--It feels like I'm beginning to spoil my beloved readers too much. LOL.
This is what happens when I get inspired by all your wonderful comments hahaha. What you guys say really inspire me, so I'd like to thank you guys for that! Speaking of what you guys say....this is the one that's always somehow present, be it in the comments or notes:
....."WHERE'S OLLIE?"
HAHAHA xD Well, ask and you shall receive. There! There's your Ollie! XD
I've been dying to show Ollie again in a chapter, and I know that you guys wanted that adorable cupcake loving Brit--so here ya go!
Also! Your parents are there! Woot! \m/
I'm not really the kind who likes those kind of moments with folks, but I just felt that it was necessary for reader-chan to hear words of encouragement. Some sort of boost---after all, (Name) will be going through a LOT of intense things soon. More intense than it already is. Haha. Look at me scaring you guys xD
I'm starting to imagine what your reactions would be about that last line. Mehehe. //shot
Anyways, that chapter part's short but sweet. I hope you guys still like it!

Er, Idk if you guys would be interested, but you can follow me on Twitter if you want :3
I'm @AziaRaine08! :) My profile picture's still the same as the one I have here on Wattpad.

Yeah, the pic over there is yours truly XD And my mochi plush. Mochi! Canada say hi!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
BTW! If you guys are interested, I have also written some other stories other than my HetaOni series:
**Canada x Reader (One Shots)**
This book includes
>> "Thinking Out Loud (Canada x Reader)" and
>>"Marry Me (Canada x Reader)" are fluffy oneshots of that insanely cute Canadian, Matthew Williams.
**Welcome Home (Hetalia x Reader)**
I've written some chapters here but I'm sort of putting in on hold because of my HetaOni series. Once I finish this book, I'll go back to update that one. :>
**BIG HERO 6 ONESHOTS!**
I'm new to the BH6 fandom, so this is my first time writing about them. I've written oneshots about that incredibly adorkable guy with the San Fransokyo Ninjas cap, Tadashi Hamada.
*[Big Hero 6] Tadashi Hamada x Reader (One Shots)*
>>  "Anniversary (Tadashi Hamada x Reader)" WARNING! THIS ONE IS SWEET, BUT HAS A SAD "YET COMFORTING" ENDING.  IF YOU WANT A HAPPY ENDING, READ:
>> "Happy Anniversary (Tadashi Hamada x Reader) -an alt. end-" It's the same as the "Anniversary" story, only it ends on a better note!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Welp, that's it for now! Thanks for the support guys. I hope you'll all stay with me til the very end of this book. Feel free to PM me, lovelots <3
