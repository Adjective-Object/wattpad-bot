CHAPTER FIVE: THE DATE
"Okay, okay. I give up." I let out a big sigh as I finally give in to Ice's persistence. "So... What do you plan on doing?"
He responded with a big smile and a questioning look. It's as if he can't believe what he's hearing.
"W-what? What's with the stare? Hurry up, tell me before I change my mind."
"W-wait! A-are you serious?"
"Do I look like I'm joking to you? You're so persistent that I'm obligated to give you a chance."
"Oh. Don't feel that way. Anyhow, you won't ever regret this!"
"But..." I stopped him from his early celebration. "But, this is not a guarantee that I will like you back or something. I'm stressing this out because you might get the wrong idea."
"Don't worry about that. I thought I promised you before that I will make you fall for me?"
"Ah..." I decided to break away from the gaze he is giving me. It was hypnotizing and it's giving me the creeps! Not the bad one, but the good kind of creeps - which is why I needed to look away as soon as possible. "So, where's the food? And oh, I have a bad feeling about that Golf guy."
"Golf? Ah..." His face showed a gloomy look for a second before continuing his sentence. "Don't worry! He's a good guy. I'm a regular here, so I should know."
"Okay, if you say so."
"Yeah."
We remained quiet and said nothing to each other while we waited for the food. It wasn't as awkward as you might've expected it to be. I'm quite surprised how the silence didn't give a sense of discomfort to any of us. It felt as if we've been doing this for a very long time already. But then again, it might've been due to the ambiance of the caf√©.
==========================================================
Golf finally served our breakfast. It was a Pancake set covered in Maple Syrup, which was far from extraordinary. I thought Ice ordered a meal that would surprise me, but meh. I guess I was kind of disappointed but not? I can't really explain it.
I stared at the maple syrup as it coats one of the pancakes. The more I follow the dripping syrup, the more things get blurry. I can't help but space out.
I opened my eyes only to see a silhouette sitting in front of me. He looked like he was uttering some words to me but I can't seem to hear them.
"Are you gonna' stare at your pancakes all day long?" Ice woke me up from my short daydream. What is wrong with me? Ever since I started hanging out with him, these weird things began happening. Maybe I'm just thinking too hard. I should try to relax sometimes.
"Ah. Uhm. Sorry about that. So..." I felt the need to start the conversation since I don't wanna' make him feel bad. I still respect him as our Student Council President and this is the least I can do to show him that. "It looks like you've known Golf for a very long time."
"..." Again, his face started to show sadness in them. It's as if he has this unfortunate thing with Golf that he doesn't want to recall. But if that's the case, then why did he bring me here? I don't understand! This is really frustrating me.
"Nevermind, let's just eat. I'm so damn hungry!"
"Yeah. I guess that's a good idea." He returned to his jolly state. Whew. This guy is moody.
==========================================================
Golf returned to our table with two Strawberry Parfaits in-hand. My grandma always told me that eating dessert after a light meal can give you stomach cramps. However, its delicious appearance makes me want to dive-in anyway!
