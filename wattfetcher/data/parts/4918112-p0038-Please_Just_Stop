It's been a while, my fellow ranters! Are we ready to tear some hair?
Fantastic. Let's begin.
There are several people, from all walks of life, that royally piss me off. Today, I shall talk about these people, because I can.
First. The people that glorify topics such as self harm, abuse, and rape.
Seriously. What. The. Fuck. This makes me want to scoop my eyes out with rusted spoons and shove them up my ass. Jesus Christ, people. This shit is serious. You wouldn't want to be a rape victim. You wouldn't want to be domestically assaulted. STOP. I WILL FIND YOU AND HUNT YOU DOWN. This isn't cool, it's not funny. It's idiotic and ignorant. Enough said.
Second. The people who still use YOLO.
No. No no noppity nope no nuuuuuu. Helllllll no. YOLO died with the dinosaur eras. Swag died when the Earth was created, however that was done. The next time someone says that God-forsaken acronym is having their eyes stabbed out with forks. Seriously.
Oh, I also hate these people cause they use this acronym to get away with stupid shit. So yeah.
Third. The people who ask for X amount of votes before an update.
Yeah, no. Go.... go stick twigs up your ass, or sacrifice yourself to the Aztec gods. You can get votes without doing that shit. If people like you, you will probably know.
Fourth. The people that misinterpret me or someone I know.
So... we all should know that this is the internet. And if you don't... You need a serious reality check.
Anyway, since this is the internet, it is, at times, difficult to interpret the tone of voice someone is trying to get across. As it is, half the time, I can't tell if shit is sarcasm or not.
However, I still can tell, just from wording, if someone is acting "holier-than-thou". And they are full of shit, honestly.
Anyway, my point is...
Oh yeah. Analyze the text a few thousand times before you become convinced that I'm talking down to you, bullying you, etc. ESPECIALLY since I don't bully people. Enough said.
