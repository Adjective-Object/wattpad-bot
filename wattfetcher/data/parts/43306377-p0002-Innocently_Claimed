"Anything." I heard my sister whisper out as more tears fell down her face. "If I heal your sister she is mine on her eighteenth birthday." He said in a serious tone. I saw Jadey look up at the man with a fearful look. "What do you mean?" I heard her ask shakily. "Is it a deal or not?" He hissed at Jade while taking his eyes off of me to bore into Jade's.
"It's a deal." I heard Jade whisper out. I saw the man crouch down before me. His eyes turning from black as coal to silver. He rested his big hands over the place my heart was about to give out. "Mia Grace Thompson your soul is mine." He said and I started to feel warmth wash over me as the pain subsided.
And than he was gone. Vanished into thin air. I felt my body start to develope oxygen as I gasped the air desperately. Jade cried out and brought me to her chest. "Thank god your okay." She whispered and held me to her. "Thank you." She whispered to no one in particular. But than I saw the man in the shadows with glowing silver eyes boring into mine. "You are mine Mia." He whispered as I felt myself drift to sleep.
