"I...I'll help out, too." I said.
They turned to me and smiled.
"Aw. Thanks, frau. You've been doing a good job so far, too! Just..be careful when going about the mansion, okay?" Prussia said. I smiled and nodded.
"Ve~ Don't worry, bella! You're going to get out of here!" Italy told me.
I looked a Italy in the eye and spoke, "You're going to get out of here, too. All of us will."
Italy's face suddenly saddened for a short moment and then went back to normal.
He smiled and quietly said, "O-Of course..."
Germany then spoke up, "All right, all right. So, the plan for tomorrow is to make a way out. We can't forget about that."
"Right. Well, now, I don't know what time it is, but let's sleep here tonight." Japan said.
"My watch broke when I wasn't looking, too!" Italy remarked.
I checked my own watch and noticed that mine is broken as well.
"Wait. Won't it be dangerous if we all go to sleep? I think one of us should stay up to keep watch." Germany suggested.
Japan nodded. "You definitely have a point. So, shall we play janken to decide fairly who will keep watch tonight? Well, with the exception of _____-chan, of course. She needs to rest for the night."
"Thanks." I said.
"Right. Oh, but uhm.. Jan..ke? What are the rules?" Italy asked.
"Well, er... It's a very simple game.You play by showing three types of hand-signs..." Japan explains.
"Whatever, let's do it already! I'm really tired! I wanna sleep!!" Prussia said, exasperated.
"Prussia, wait just a little." Germany scolded his older brother.
"--and Rock beats Scissors.You can throw Rock, Scissors, or Paper." Japan said.
"Ah, it's a little like "La Morra".Okay, I got it, Japan! Let's do it!" Italy said.
Japan agrees. "Let's go, then.
Jan

After the game of Janken, Prussia lost and was made to keep watch for the night while the four went to sleep. Germany was at the far left, beside him was Italy, next to him was Japan and ______ was at the far right end.
Prussia then spoke to himself. "Aah...Seriously, it's so fun being alone...
But those three, they really sound asleep...
Haaa...If only I had my computer, I could update my blog. Now all I can do is take pictures of their sleeping faces.
It's just... their serious faces... They looked awesome.
I couldn't resist them. ....
Sniff sniff...
I'm kinda... cold. The fire is... strong enough. What the hell!? I just felt a chill running down my spine..."
Suddenly, the loud knocking of the door and incessant clanking of the knob was heard.
