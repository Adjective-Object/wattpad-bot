Jeff P.O.V
I looked over at her and watched her as she just played with her phone "what's up with you?" she asked me and I gave no answer. I saw her roll her eyes before continuing to scroll on her phone.
"what are you doing on that stupid phone anyway?" I asked feeling quite annoyed at her lack of attention on me.
"why do you care?" she spit back
"let's do something else!" I snatched the phone away from her and threw it into a forgotten corner.
Sabrina's P.O.VOkay WTF Jeff I thought before watching him climb on top of me, he stared at me for what seems like forever before slowly leaning in and taking my lips as his own. I felt him slip his snake-like tongue into my mouth making me blush uncontrollably but I couldn't help but kiss him back. There's something wrong with me, I'm kissing the very guy that murdered my mom and maybe even my dad. Can I really say that I hate him?
These thoughts just rang in my head, I never even felt him pull his lips away.
"Do you wanna stay here and make this our home or leave with me?" I heard him say and snapped out of it
"where would we go?
"Anywhere your hearts desire" he smiled warmly and kissed my cheek
"then let's go, where do you live?" I asked and all he did was point towards the woods. I nodded and gave him a little smile. "well first I wanna finish what you started"
