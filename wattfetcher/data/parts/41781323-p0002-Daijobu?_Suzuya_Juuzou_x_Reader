He left the room, while Juuzou looked at you. "All cut up like that. Such a shame for a pretty face." You were awake, and could clearly hear that. You couldn't do anything though. You had to rest.
You slightly shifted in the hospital bed. "Juu...zou..." You whispered. He turned to you.
"Daijobu?" He asked.
"Yeah." You replied, slowly sitting up. "F/N, What's your story?" He asked. "My, my what?" You hazily replied.
"Everyone has one. I'm Suzuya, Juuzou, an outcast of society." He smiled at you.
"I guess I'm the same as you then." You replied. Juuzou held your hand and said, "Outcasts stick together." He let go, blushing at the moment.
"Is the mission over?" You asked. "No, I left." He replied. "My injury wasn't too bad, it'll heal." Juuzou lifted up part of is shirt to show where the kagune had gone through his lower back and out the other side around his hip.
You held out your hand and touched the bandaged area. "Doesn't it hurt?" You asked, confused. He had only gotten it recently, so shouldn't he be in pain? You thought.
"I, I don't know if it hurts." He said, his eyes getting glassy.
"I-It's already 10. Get some sleep." He said, awkwardly. You usually go to sleep at 12 or so. Internet calls.
Juuzou walked out of the room, his face turning pink.
You'd ask him to stay, since it was obvious he wanted to, but the room was small and he'd have to sleep on a chair. Besides that, there's way too much medical equipment.
You could see him tomorrow.
Hey! Remember to vote on the chapters, so I'll update more often! If you didn't know, daijobu means alright in Japanese. Arigato! P.S. I'm writing this on June 8th, Juuzou's birthday! ðŸŽ‰
