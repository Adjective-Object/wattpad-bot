"Darcy, what are you doing?" Conrad asked from the distance.
Sakura hastily moved away from Darcy, blushing profusely.
Darcy gritted his teeth and shut his eyes for a moment to regain control of his emotions. Yes, he needed to appear cool and in control in front of his brothers. He didn't want to show his brothers just how fragile he was emotionally, especially where this young woman was concerned. After all, he'd never shown his brothers anything other than the cool, collected, and arrogant Darcy who didn't give a shit what everyone else thought of him.
Once he'd gained control of himself, he turned calmly to Conrad and Nicolas, who were watching him, waiting for his answers.
"She fell," he said. Then before they could ask him any more questions, which he knew they wouldn't anyway, he reluctantly removed his arm from Sakura's waist and then walked away toward the stairs.
Sakura watched Darcy go. She was relieved that he didn't growl at her for running into him. She was also relieved that, for the first time, he had smiled at her. Perhaps, just perhaps, he'd forgiven her.
"You fell again?" Conrad asked Sakura. "You should be careful."
"I'm a bit clumsy today," she said. "I think we should go to dinner." With that, she walked past them toward the stairs as well, Toby trotting after her happily.
"Wait for me." Conrad chuckled, rushing after her.
Nicolas cocked his head to one side as he watched them go. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, his eyes narrowed. "Darcy," he said. "You're letting down your guard, brother."
