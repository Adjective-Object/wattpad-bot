(Jacks Pov)
its been about almost two months.....me and sabrina are still not talking.
you may think it's silly....but i dont! she cant leave after everything we have been through.
oh and.....um, me and leigh are now dating.....i asked her out two weeks ago.....sabrina looked pretty upset about it...but, i dont care.
right now, im getting ready for our school's halloween party. me and jj are going as nerds. i dont know what leigh is gonna be. she said its a "suprise".
whatever. i take one last look in the mirror , i look pretty good for a nerd. i think me and johnson, are honestly the hottest nerds out there.
i take a pic with Johnson and post it to twitter.
i see sabrina posted her outfit, it was adorable. she looked cute.
(all of their outifts above)
wait...what am i saying, i have a girlfriend. i shake the thought out of my head and call for sammy upstairs. "are yall done yet chelsea?" i ask johnsons mom.
she was doing sammy's skeleton face. "yeah im coming" he says.
"woah bro! that is dope!" i say. johnson agrees.
"i know tristen is gonna love it!" he says. i nod. "ok yall ready?" i ask. they nod their heads and we head to the school._____________________(Sabrinas Pov)
two months....two months me and jack haven't been together.....
to be honest i act fine...but we all know im not.
he looks so happy without me. so why does he not want me to leave....to me it looks like he would have the time of his life , if i was gone....but whatever.
it really hurt me to see him with leigh.....it hurt me a lot, i literally cried for two days straight ,my mom let me stay home....she doesnt know. she thought i was "sick".
but there is nothing i can do about him and leigh....he obviously didnt care that we broke up.
anyways....i was at tristens house getting ready for our school's halloween party. we looked pretty hot.
i posted a pic on twitter and instantly got a lot of likes....i was scrolling through my feed when i saw jacks post of him and johnson.
they looked c-, johnson looked cute, no i dont have feelings for johnson, he is my best friend.
"hey you ready?!" tristen asked. "yup lets go!" i say grabbing my stuff , and we leave.__________________when we arrive at the school, we got a lot of compliments on our costume (costumes above).
"hey look there's sammy!" tristen says. i look to where she is pointing, and look at her. "yeah with Johnson, leigh, and the asshole himself!" i say.
"oh come on, for me please?!" she says begging. i roll my eyes. "your lucky your my best friend, and i love you" i say. "yay!" she grabs my hand and we go over there.
"hey bri!" johnson says noticing us first. "hey jj!" i say hugging him. "yall look great!" sammy says. "thank you, and woah sam, your face looks awesome!" i say
"credits to Chelsea!" sammy says, "jj, your mom did this?!" i asked amazed. "yup!" he said. i could see jack looking at me from the corner of my eye, i just decided to be nice.
"hey you and jack look nice!" i say looking at jack and jj. "um...thanks?" jack said more like a question, probably suprised.
