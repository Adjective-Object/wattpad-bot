-Jude Pov-
I walked into my new school, since I have moved into a new foster home with my sister Callie.
I'll tell you a little bit about me and my new life..
My new foster family is really nice, I now have two moms (yes two moms) Stef and Lena, and then Mariana and Jesus are twins and are adopted, and Brandom is Stef's biological son and now Callie and I have moved in.
They are planning to adopt us soon so we don't have to go through what we have for the last few years.
And what I mean by that is moving around every 4 weeks, being put into bad foster homes, and more.
So I was feeling nervous even though this is not my first time in changing schools.
I walked into school with Lena since she was the vice principal and she walked me to my class, English, and I hated English as well.
"Bye Hunny, I will see you later" She said pecking my forehead.
"Bye Mom" I smiled.
I could tell she was surprised that I called her mom after only being with them for two weeks.
I walked into class and there were a few people there so I just sat down.
Then the bell went off and everyone piled in and a boy, quite tall with sandy brown hair sat next to me because the teacher made him.
He has a nice smile..
Wait Jude you can't think like that! You like girls!
It's just a compliment right?
Right.
"Okay class sit down" The teacher said coming into the class.
"So class, today a new student joined us, would you mind standing up and introducing yourself"
"Sure, Um.. I'm Jude Jacobs and I'm new here as you already know" I said then sat down.
"So Jude, I'm Connor" The boy next to me said.
"Nice" I said and then looked away because his eyes were gorgeous.
Wait a minute.
Did I really just say that.
Nah it's just me being weird.
Stop Jude.
"So do you wanna eat lunch with me and the boys, and by boys I mean 3 other dudes" He offered.
I turned to look at him again and I let out a "Sure, yeah" and smiled.
Why did he make me nervous?
I then blushed.
"Um what are you blushing for? Are you gay? Do you like me?" He laughed awkwardly.
"Um, ye- I mean no of course not" I stuttered.
"I knew you were a fag"
"What I am not" I said taken back.
"Shut up fag get lost and find some girls to hang out with" He sneered and then the bell went off and he was out like a bolt of lightning.
Wow..
Well now someone hates me already..
How nice.
~I was looking for a place to sit at lunch when I see Connor appear through the door. Shit.
"Can I talk to you for a minute" He says coming up to me.
