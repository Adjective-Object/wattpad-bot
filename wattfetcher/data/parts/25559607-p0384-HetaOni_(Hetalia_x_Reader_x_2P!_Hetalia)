On the side of the First Players, current time loop, a magic circle surrounding America, illuminates the room.



Italy suddenly froze as he saw what was in front of him. "That's-"


"...A barrier... Wh-what the hell is this?!" America exclaimed, starting to feel frantic at the strange display of magic.


Italy began to think of an explanation for all of this. Observing the magic circle, he realised something. "It's the same as when England teleported us! But why? He wasn't even doing anything; it just happened on it's own. As if it sensed America was in danger and automatically- If we assume...that it had been America for a long time... Maybe it was England... when we..."


It was then that Italy remembered that important event back when they were in the second time loop.

Past England clicked his tongue. "God, what a nuisance!" he shouted as he pointed his hands at us.


A light suddenly glows around me, Germany, (Name), and America.



"I can't move!" America exclaimed, trying to get his feet up to walk over to Past England. Try as he might, he simply can't do it now. Neither of the us four could.



Past England faced us and gave a weak smile. "Don't worry. I'll die before it can attack you I'll teleport you back with the journal using what little magic I've got left..."



Germany shook his head. "Wait! You're-"



"Please, cut it off." Past England told us, shaking his head.


And at that, Germany, (Name), America and I were transported back to our original time, the current time loop.

"England...fought to his last breath for the sake of our future selves..." Italy concluded, his lips trembling.


England suddenly shouted, gaining his attention. "Take cover!!"


"...America!" Italy called out as he ran towards their side.
