A tall woman with curly black hair stood outside a dress shop in London. Another woman with dark red hair stood next to her. "Is this one last on the list, Annabel?" Annabel turned and looked at her. "Yeah. Hey, Lily, they have bridesmaid dresses here, too. We should shop for you!" Lily grinned. "Okay. Have you picked a color yet?" Annabel nodded. "I've got it narrowed down to three colors. What do you think; silver, black, or green?" Lily thought. "I think silver and black together would be absolutely gorgeous. Plus, Sirius would love it. You should make it the entire theme of the wedding!" Annabel pushed open the door to the shop. "Actually, that's a really good idea. Thanks, Lily." The two women started searching through the racks of dresses, looking for the perfect wedding gown. Finally, they sighed. Annabel turned to leave. "We're not going to find any silver and black dresses here, and I didn't see any at the other stores. Let's find you, Molly, Mary, and Alice some black gowns. Now... How about this one?" She held up a short, fluffy dress. Lily gasped. "Oh, it's perfect! The two women walked up to the register and ordered four dresses, all in varying sizes. When the woman at the register asked, Annabel glanced at Lily and whispered, "Where do we send the dresses? To Muggles, our house doesn't exist!" Lily groaned. "I cannot believe we didn't think of that!" Then, Lily grinned wickedly. "We'll send it to my sister's house." Annabel laughed. "Send it to Number Four Privet Drive. It's in Little Whinging, in Surrey." The clerk nodded. "Okay, hun. Good luck at your wedding!"A/N: The picture is what I decided on for the bridesmaid dresses.
