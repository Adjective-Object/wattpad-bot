I knew I wouldn't be able to look at him the same way again so I ran, well... I packed as much as I could into my overly large duffel bag, practically all of my clothes fit and a paor of converse and VANS would fit. that was practically all I needed apart from Â£2000 pounds that I have saved up from my jobs and then I ran.
My house was a large one that's back garden was the forest so once I knew nobody was left in the house and were all down at my mums celebration I left and ran to the woods.
I ran towards my mothers grave and made sure nobody was there before I sat down and had as much of a conversation with her as you could with a dead person.
"Hey mum, I'm sorry I'm leaving. I just can't stand it anymore, you probably don't even care that I'm leaving you and Caitlin because I was the reason you died but I just needed to say goodbye one last time. I found my mate today, It was Alpha Cayden. He rejected me as I expected. I don't want to see him again, it'll be too hard" I explained, my voice cracking towards the end "Well mum, I need to go before they come for the memorial. Just remember that I love you and Caitlin,  no matter how much you hate me. Bye."
Once I finished talking to mum, I went behind a tree, stripped my clothes off, stuffed them into my bag, shifted into my pure gold wolf and ran without looking back.
