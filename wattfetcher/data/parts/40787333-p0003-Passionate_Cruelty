***************************‡A/N‡****************************Wow, 1,699 words on my first chapter, not including this A/N. Sorry if it's a bit long. I'm writing on my tablet and it looked like too little, so I had to join the first chapter with some of the second one. But yeah, I really hope that you guys liked it and if you need anything, feel free to PM me or comment on this or my other story. ENJOY!!!!
