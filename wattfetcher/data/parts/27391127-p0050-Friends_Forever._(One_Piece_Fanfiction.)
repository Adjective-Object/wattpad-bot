She was worried about Haruka since he ws fighting Doflamingo but was more worried about his next statement.

"He's not our biggest problem right now."

What did that mean? All her questions were answered when Haruka and Marco crash-landed into the ballroom.

--- A few minutes earlier-------


"They're at the castle."
"How far is it?"

"By land, 2 hours. By air most likely 5 minutes."
"Yosh, we're going by air-yoi. Grab onto my legs."


"No fucking way! I can get there myself!"
"How, I thought you usually depended on Aya to fly."

"I don't need that useless pink piece of shit to get there!" Harua yelled, some pink dusting his cheeks.

It was true though but in times like this, he really wished that he was born naturally.

"My Geppou is much faster than your flight."
"Nani?"
"You heard me, you blonde pineapple." Haruka answered with a smug face, that if he shows in the school, the girls will die from sheer sexiness.

"That Fire Ass told you that didn't he?"
"Don't make fun of Ace-sama!"
"Since when were you gay?!"
"I am not gay."
"Really, I did not hear." Marco teased cupping his hand around his ear.

"I. AM. NOT. GAY." Haruka spelled.
"Are you disrespecting me yoi?"
"Maybe I am." Haruka answered.

"Last one to the palace does canteen duty."
"On."

With that, the two males rapidly took of and started their race. Marco flying at 100 m/h and Haruka kicking almost at the same speed.

"I reached here first!" Haruka exclaimed like a child.
"No way, I did."

"You wanna fight it out you motherfucker?!"
"Bring it on!"

Aya quietly walked over and an irk mark appeared on her clenched fists.
