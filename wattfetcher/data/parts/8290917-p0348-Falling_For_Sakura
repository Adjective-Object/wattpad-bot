"Just over three million," Haruka said.
Sakura nearly choked on her breath. Just over three million? She couldn't believe it. If there was no Mrs. Byrd, then Sakura wouldn't have to suffer the torture and bullying. If there was no Mrs. Byrd, then Sakura would have a lovely childhood, what with all that money saved up for her.  But that was not to be.
"Sakura," James said. "You do understand that you might be in danger where Mrs. Clark is concern?"
Sakura nodded.
"If she knows Sakura recognized her," Sebastian said, "she'd make sure Sakura stays quiet."
Sakura said, "She knows I recognized her. I saw it in her eyes. She was scared, Sebastian."
"Then there's no doubt she'd be planning on something?" Darcy asked his father.
James nodded. "Erick said she owns a gentlemen parlor. She has a number of men working for her."
The brothers understood what men was in their father's context. They were ruthless gangs who went about doing their own things regardless of the laws. They were men the Princeton didn't like, going about doing drugs and killing anyone they were asked to, provide there was good pay.
Sebastian turned his attention to Sakura. From now on, they'd have to be on guard where she was concern. There might a chance that Mrs. Clark wasn't going to do anything to Sakura, but that chance was slim, considering the extended the woman had gone to in order to gain her second identity and lifestyle. What they needed was more information and that'd take time. Meanwhile, they'd just have to look after Sakura as best as they could.
It was some half an hour later that everyone bothered to leave Haruka and Sakura alone so that they could do some mother and daughter catch up session. It was a long one, since they hadn't seen each other for twenty five years.
