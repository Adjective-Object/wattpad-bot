Hey everybody, so many of you probably know of this game already. I started off playing this in Harmony's Journey Sequel. I am itching to update a book (not in the literal sense), but sadly none have reached comment goals. In place of comment goals, we will play the guessing game. The answers to the questions can be found in either Finding Joy or this book, Fighting for Joy. Maybe even both.
What are Lauren's parents occupations?What state do they live in?
When I get the correct answer, I'll update the book immediately and the person who guessed correctly will have the chapter dedicated to them. One person must answer each part of the question.
So, being that I have multiple books and you will all be guessing to get an update, which ever book gets the answer to their question faster, earns the update. Meaning, if Harmony's Journey Sequel answers their Guessing Game question before this book, you guys won't get your update until their chapter is done. All updates will be done quickly. A quick edit will be and the chapter will be sent out, so I suggest you guys try and try hard!
Good Luck,Dream ðŸ’‹
