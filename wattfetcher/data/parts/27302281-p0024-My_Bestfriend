Then I went off to sleep
Kylie POV
I laid in bed awake for a while. Until I heard some thunder and jumped  in my skin and hid under then blanket  then there was another clap of. Thunder then lightning striked   and I screamed then jumped up and ran into Justin's room and  dove beside him
" kylie baby what's wrong " he mumbled rubbing his eyes
" thunder lighting "  I frose as another strike of lighting filled the sky and the sound of thunder shook the  house
" come here " he said living the blanket and  pulling me close to his body
"   I got you"  he said  stroking my hair then I drifted off into a deep sleep
Few hours later still dark
I woke up expecting justin to be beside me but he wasnt so I rolled out of bed and started walking then I heard Justin's phone ring  I ran over to it
Unknown caller it read so I slid it over to answer it
Unknown caller =  hello justin thank god  I missed you so much  I love you baby when are you coming to see me
Me = who is this  I asked tearing up
Unknown caller= selena   I must have the wrong number this is justin Biebers phone right
Me = yeah he's in the shower
Unknown caller=   oh well tell him selena called and to call me back when he gets out the shower  and do you know if he's in a relationship
Me= no hes not at least not anymore
Unknown caller = if you don't mind me asking who is this exactly
Me = his girlfriend his  ex now
Unknown caller =   we have been dating for months now I'm so sorry I didn't know I thought he was cheating thanks for letting me know
Me =  thanks bye selena
" Justin  I answered your phone since your in the shower"  I said against the bathroom door
" thanks baby who was it " he asked
" selena" I said then heard him sigh  then I  sat down and cried in my knees
"  baby are you ok what the heck did she say to you"  justin said running out the bathroom in boxers and sitting in front of me and trying to grab my hand
"  dont touch me" I yelled at him crying and accidentally slapped him
" I'm sorry " I said watching angry fill his eyes then I ran in my room  and  locked the door and laid under the covers   I cried into my pillow
Justin POV
" baby open the door " I yelled knocking on the door
" let me in baby I'm sorry please unlock the door " I yelled again
" I never cheated remember the promise I made your dad"  I whispered
I know she accidentally slapped me  but why did she run
