" ok " he said making a swift movement he picked me up and threw me on the couch then quickly climbed on top of me then kissed me all the way down my neck
" ok you win "I said squirming cause I knew how this was going to end then he tickled me
" I love you " I said
" nice try " he said
Then I grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him down to me and kissed his lips and then he put his elbows on each side of my head and I flipped us over so I was on top and he begged for entrance which I granted
then I got off him
" you tricked me again didn't you " he asked
" yup " I smirked
" I'm so gullible" he said sitting up and fixing his hair
" I gotta go " I said looking at my phone
"What why " he whined
" my dads coming home soon unless you want to meet him " I said
" sure I'll meet him" he said scratching the back of his neck
" let's go get changed then " I said smiling
