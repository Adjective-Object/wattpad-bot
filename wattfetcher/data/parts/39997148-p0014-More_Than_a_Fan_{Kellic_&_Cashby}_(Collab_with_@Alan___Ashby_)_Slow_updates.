"Sorry." I muttered wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, "Gross."
"Yeah try being covered in it." He said his glare intensifying.
I gave him an apologetic smile, "Sorry again."
He rolled his eyes, "It's whatever, let's just get back to the bus."
I nodded and let him help me back to the bus.
"I'm going to go take a shower, you go brush your teeth and drink some fucking water." He said as soon as we walked inside.
I did as he said before heading back to my bunk. I stripped to my boxers before getting up in my bunk and falling straight to sleep.
"Vic wake the fuck up!" Someone yelled shaking my shoulder roughly.
I groaned and pulled the covers over my head, "Leave me alone."
"You have to talk to that guy who might be the merch manager." Tony said as someone ripped my blankets away from me.
"Why can't you guys just meet him? I don't care who he is."
"Because you're the lead singer." Mike said and yanked me out of my bunk.
"So what? I don't want to meet him."
"You're meeting him."  Mike told me and yanked me off of the floor roughly.
"Fucking fine." I muttered, glaring at him.
"Good. Now get ready he's waiting."
I glared at my band but went and got dressed quickly, I didn't understand why I had to go meet him but it looks like I'm being forced to.
"Don't be grumpy either!"
"Whatever." I mumbled, "Just get me some aspirin or something."
"Here." Jaime said handing some to me, "You owe me for throwing up on my favorite shirt too by the way."
"I threw up on you?"
"Yeah, ya did."
"Sorry," I said sheepishly. "So how about we go meet that new merch guy huh?"
"Yeah, come on."
"So where is he?" I asked as we all headed out of the bus.
"You have to meet up with him at this little cafe." Tony told me.
"Just me?" I asked.
"Yup, we're all going to go do something while you talk to him, But, I think Alan's going with you so you'll be fine." Mike said.
"Then where the hell is Alan?"
"I'm right here!" He said running up to us.
"Oh okay, you know where to go then?"
"Of course I know where he is." He said like it was obvious.
"Alright then, let's go."
"Okay." He said. We left the other guys and started walking along.  "No offense but you look like shit." He informed me.
"Oh wow, thanks. I didn't know that." I told him sarcastically.
"It makes sense, you got high and drank way too fast." He said, "Learn to space out your alcohol."
"I know how to space it all out, last night, I just couldn't have cared less." I told him shoving my hands in my pockets.
