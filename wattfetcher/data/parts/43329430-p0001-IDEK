TGFbro are British youtubers and they are so fucking hilarious. They only have about 150k subs but they're amazing. They do dare, TGF dare us, and they always end up hurt in some way. Jay, the white guy with the blonde hair in the picture, and Romell, the black guy with the hat, are the duo that run this channel. I swear if you watch even one episode you will laugh so hard you'll shit yourself. I've watched so much I'm developing an accent...(/^â–½^)/
