I suddenly turned and shouted leave me alone and suddenly there was an energy surge in, it was so power, so wanting, I like it.
There and that, the darkness faded and my room was back and everything was floating in my room.
See Anna you can, I hear.
How do I stop this, I say, gulping my saliva back in.
Just believe and it will happen
I closed my eyes and when I opened it I saw that things were settling into place, I smiled by fact that I could do this.
Now Anna, you must be learn, and see what are you capable, I'm here to tech you to control and activate your power. And lastly you must learn how to use the catalysts power.

With that I was left alone in my room.
