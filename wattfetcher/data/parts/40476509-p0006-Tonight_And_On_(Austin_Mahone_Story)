"Thanks" I said to him while having my hands on my cheeks since I don't want him to see me blushing. "I know you're blushing, there's no need to hide it" he said making me laugh and put my forehead on his shoulder still covering my cheeks.
I was tired so I checked what time it was on my phone and it was 1:50am. I yawned and covered my mouth. "I'm tired" I said and acted like a baby. "Do you want to go home cause I can take you home or do you want to stay at my place?" He asked me as he rubbed my back while I rested my head on his shoulder.
"I want to stay at your place" I said like a little baby which made him laugh. "Ok my place it is" he said laughing. He picked me up and told Riya that I was gonna stay at his place for the night and that we are going home since I'm tired. She said ok and we left.
He carried me to his car and put me in the passenger seat and buckled my seat belt for me. He got in the car and drove to his place.
**When we got to his house it was pretty big. He carried me out of the car and into his house. He brong me up stairs and into his room. "I don't have any clothes for you to wear so you can just wear my T-shirt to sleep" he said as he took off my shoes, close and jewelry.
"I don't mind, as long as its comfortable" I said as I began to fall asleep little by little. He finished undressing me and put his T-shirt on me. He laid me down and he changed into his PJs. He laid next to me and I went to sleep.
Austin's P.O.V.
"Today is the day I met my true love" I said to myself. I cupped her face in my hand and rubbed her cheek with my thumb. I kissed her good night. "I know I don't really know you but, I love you" I said to her.
