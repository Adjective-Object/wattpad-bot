"Leena, wake up" I felt a hard slap on my right cheek, "Where am I ?" I opened my eyes slowly, "You're at my house" Molly passed me a glass of water, "What happened ? What went wrong ?" Molly asked, "Did she wake up?" Simon came into the room, "GET OUT, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU" I screamed at him, "IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU" I threw the glass at him, "HAVE AN ABORTION THEN ! DONT BLAME IT ON ME" He shoutef back, "WHAT ! WHAT'S GOING ON ? WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE YOU FAINTED?" Molly frealed out, I broke in tears and Simon chuckled then left.
"... And that's how I got pregnant and then became Jake's girlfriend" I told her the full story of my transformation.
"The death of your parents doesn't mean that Allah hates you" She said, "Oh really ? Why did he take my parents away then?" I said angrily, "You believed in faith before, you believed that got Tests us to bring out the best of us, to give us Jannah as a reward. Doing all of this : Wearing shorts, putting makeup amd dating boys, all of this won't bring your parents back. You can't get worse because Allah took away something from you, you should thank him because only HE (The greatest) only knows what's the best for you. Instad of wearing this, you should be praying and crying asking for forgiveness as soon as your forehead touches the floor. Leena, you changed me, you changed my life ! After what you had told me and Tom about being proud of our religion and showing it off to the world, After telling me that I shouldn't hide and shouldn't be afraid, I took a huge step, faced my family, faced the whole world and got out wearing a hijab. It wasn't easy at first, and it hasn't gotten much easier by now. But I'm proud ! I feel free ! My mother didn't accept it but she couldn't just kick me out. And somehow, Simon didn't bother it at all. For Tom, he gathered all the hiding muslims in the yard amd prayed Al Duhr prayer in front of everybody. At last, we became courage. We deleted 'Fear' off of our head amd showed the whole world who we are and what we are. All of this was because of you. Because of what you told us a dayy before you left to Jordan. You gave us a push that heated the blood in our veins. You can't just forget all of that, forget all of what you know about Islam and take a different and worse path just because Allah took your parents, they're probably in a better place, watching you, and not feeling well about the new you. You can't just forget what is Islam and start makimg it look bad by your stupid and childish actions. You won't bring your parents back by disobeying Allah, you won't look prettier if you wear a see-through shirt, neither will you make the picture of Islam clearer by bullying, and you won't pass what happened betweeÂ  you and my reckless brother by jumping into Jake's lap"
"I wanted to be free, to feel completely from for once" I sobbed
"What the hell is wrong with you? Freedom isn't about drinking, dating and wearing shorts ! It's about being able to choose what's better for you ! And I believe that what you've been doing until now is nothing close to good. WAKE UP !" She shouted through tears.
"Getting back the way I was won't change the fact that I'm pregnant and will get hate from everybody even my family and we'll get called by the most offensive names, so I'll enjoy my time until everybody knows about my pregnancy. Excuse me, I'm late for Jake" I got up and caught the door handle.......
Will this wake Leena up? Will it get her back to who she was? Or she will act like Molly's sentences are nothing but some meaningless words ?
