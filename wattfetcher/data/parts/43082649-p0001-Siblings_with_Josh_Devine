Hello, my name is Charlotte Devine. Your probably thinking where you have heard that last name before, think of One Direction, think of their drummer. Yup you guessed it, I'm related to Josh Devine, my older, very over protective, annoying, caring brother. Boy I love him but he gets on my nerves a lot.
I'm only 15 as he is 23 and living his life to the highest he can. Except that all changed when Josh and Charlie where hanging out at their home when Josh got a call and everything changed...
