Ok. I know people may think I have NO LIFE becuz I update so much, but I'm GROUNDED. So, yeah. I LITERALLY have nothing better to do than sit at my dad's computer all day and TYPE. I'm pretty sure I'm screwing up my eyes, but IDC. I'm planning on getting, like, 5 chapters up on this story today, and, 3 or 4 on  my other one. More if I can stay up late... Last night I was up until 12!
My parents may get mad if I do that againðŸ˜…. So, yeah, AT THE LEAST 2 chapters and at the most... 8. Yeah. 8. SO, laters. I'm already working on the next chapter, it'll be up soon! So, see ya in, ummmmmmmmmm, 20 mins? Less? More?
