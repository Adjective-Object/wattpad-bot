"Please, it will be fun. I mean watching movies together, cuddling *winks* and who knows, this might be a day for you to remember forever" Jake was inviting me to spend a night at his house because his parents are not home and "It will be fun" as he said. I wasn't stupid enough to not read what was hidden between the lines.
"Leena ! Cut it ! You're eating like a crazy pregenant woman ! You have put on some extra weight" Miley snapped the chocolate bar from my hand, only if she knew that getting fat was the plan...
"Are you pregnant ?" Conor asked and looked at Jake, "No she's not" Jake chuckled, "But maybe in few days" He whispered in my ear not low enough because Miley and Conor gave us a dirty look.
I saw Simom walking toward us, "Okay Jake, I'll be in front of your door at 6" I said loud enough for Simon to hear, He stopped, took a deep breath, opened his mouth, Say it ! Say it Simon ! Say that you Still love me, say that you want me and I'll sneak to your chest. But, NO ! He closed his mouth and continued walking.
Was that revenge? From Simon? Or from myself? Was I running into another guys arms to crack another one's heart ? Or just to forget where and who I had become ?

"Have you told Karam? About your pregnancy ?" I heard Simon whisper to me from behind, he was sitting right behind me in Spanish class, I ignored his question, "Then, I'll assume that you haven't" I felt his smirk through his words, "Don't even try to piss me off" I whispered, "Oh really? Then you better stay at home today if you still don't want him to know" I turned around and glared at him, "It's not of your damn business" I said angrily, or happily because he got jealous but hiding it, "It's not, I just want to make sure that it would still be my baby and that it will come out in good health so when you throw it on my doorstep once you get it out, it doesn't turn out to be a disabled baby because of the bear and sh*t you've been taking. A baby is a problem which is big enough, don't need it to get bigger by having a disabled one" I slammed the books on my desk and left the class.
I left the school with my car in front of it, ran with tears in my eyes until I saw something, I rubbed my eyes to make sure of what I had seen, I looked closely and ... It was Molly, after 2 months of not showing, she showed up, differently. She didn't look like the one she was .... she looked like the one I was ...
Molly showed up wearing a hijab, she walked with confidence and with her head held high, she also had an Abaya on, her face was shining until .... her eyes lied on me. She walked slowly toward me and stood in front of me, "I'm sorry, but you look a lot like someone I know" She smiled, "That's because it's me, Leena" I sobbed, she gasped and her eyed widened, "What ! What happened? Why are you dressed like this ? Where did the hijab and loose clothes go ?where did you get these shorts from ?" She asked me about 100 questions at once leaving me with no ability to answer, "I'm pregnant" I said it, I couldn't hold the secret longer, I needed to tell somebody, I needed to empty my chest. I hugged her with all the force I had then I felt my arms getting weaker and my knees stopped being able to hold me. Pregnancy and hormones stink. I Fainted.
