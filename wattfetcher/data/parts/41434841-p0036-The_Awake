Sometimes I wonder what will happen. If my mother will take my favorite button up out of the closet, the black one with feathers, and smell it, trying to remember the scent of my "Aqua" cologne and the sweet mint gum I always have in my pocket. If my father will stop seeing his therapist. If he will stop taking his medication. If my pictures will be removed from the walls. If my room will be locked up and never touched again. If my sister will understand what they mean when they tell her I'm gone. If they will sell my guitar. If they will go through my phone. If my step brother's first suit will be to my funeral. If my sister will ask for our favorite blanket, the one up in my closet. If she'll still want to read Alice in Wonderland. If my dad will still keep the classic rock station turned all the way up. If he will even listen to that station anymore. If Jordan will visit my grave. If he will try to remember me. If he will cry. If his life will be ruined. If he'll still go to the movies. If he'll still go through our old Skype or kik chats. If he'll keep my selfies. If he'll still look at my Instagram or tumblr. If he'll ever be able to get close to another Ashton. If he'll still pursue his career of choice. If he'll forget about me. If he'll still listen to certain songs. If he'll trust someone as he trusted me. I worry about him. I wonder if he'll be mad at me.
I think of too many things.
