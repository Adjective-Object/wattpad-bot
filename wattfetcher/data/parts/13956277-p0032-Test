"You're such a chicken, Damon" I said loudly, then he came.
"Who are you calling a freaking chick-en" Damon came wearing a fake angry face holding a knife in each hand with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow. I bursted out laughing at his look.
"Move away chick" he pushed me off the chair.
"Ouch" but I forgot the pain because I laughed my lungs out at Damon who looked disgusted while taking a feather after another.
"It's like jelly" Damon poked the naked chicken.
"It's going to fall" I jumped to catch it, but I ended up with having a sticky chicken on my face.
"Yo-BHAHAHAH Your fa-HAHAHA" Damon fell off the chair.
"I might need a bath" I wrinkled my nose.
"After you cook" Damon took the chicken to wash it.
We got in the house "Now we have to clean it, I need some lemon and vinegar".
*2 hours later*
"That thing is so delicious" Mrs.Carter said.
"Hmmm, So you admit that I'm a better cooker than you ha ?" I smiled.
"yeah" Damon and Elina said, Mrs.Carter glared at both of them.
"What do you call this food" Mrs.Carter asked.
"Kabsa" I smiled
"I want more" Damon said.
"You've already eaten three plates ! you never complete one when I cook" Mrs.Carter frowned, me and Elina chuckled.
"I need to do my homework" I walked up to my room and pulled some books.
Math.
I love math ! weird ha? It's Okay I'm not normal anyway ..

A question after another until I finished.
"50 cents ha ?" I raised my head and saw Damon leaning on the door frame.
"What?" I raised an eyebrow
"68" He giggled.
"Get out of my room" I pulled the history book.
"I'm not even in it" He shrugged, I sighed in anger.
"I checked my bank account. Thanks for the tips, 50 cents. I'm a billionaire now" He said sarcastically.
"Did you think that I'll give you 20 dollars or so? I was gonna give you a WHOLE DOLLAR, but I cut 50% of it because you keep annoying me"
"I was wondering, if you can help me with math, please ? I got an 'E'" He asked politely.
"No" I flipped the page I was reading.
"I'll do whatever you want, but please help me, my father will take my car if I get another E" He put that puppy face on.
"Tom is good in math too, he's your friend, he'll help you"
"And you're my sister, you'll help me" He smiled.
"You ain't fooling anybody Damon, You got B+ I saw it. Now get out" I closed the door.
