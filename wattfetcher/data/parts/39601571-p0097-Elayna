So this q&a is a good example as to why I'm leaving. Some of the questions were way out of proportion and not appropriate, while others were just plain rude.
Also me and my depressions has nothing to do with anyone. If I'm suicidal or depressed or what ever that doesn't concern you, unless your the reason. If I ask for your help, or open up to you then it does. This Q&a was really inappropriate.You guys should ask questions like that, that was very uncalled for am I'm really pissed right now. Especially since I know these people personally.
