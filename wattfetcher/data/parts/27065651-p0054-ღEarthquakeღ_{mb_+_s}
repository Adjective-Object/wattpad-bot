If I seem a little out of it for the next few days, it'll be due to sadness. My Bucky, he made me so happy, and I loved him so much. But, he just left, and I didn't get to say goodbye. It hurts so much to know that I never got to tell him how much he meant to me, and I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much as I love my Bucky Barnes. I hope he comes back, but if someone closes their account, the chances of a return are slim to none. Don't worry, I won't be sad forever, but this one....hit me harder than any other breakup... ever.
He completed me, and now I'm lost....
With Love,
Skye
