My house was just a couple of blocks from my sister's.  It wasn't technically mine, but I stayed there with my parents.  Most unmated females remained at home until their mates claimed them.  Would I forever be living at home? The thought depressed me.
I shuffled my feet, feeling weary and not paying attention to anything other than the shuffling of my feet.  Street lamps lit the way, so I was not shadowed in complete darkness.  I kept walking, not paying any attention to anything other than my thoughts when I bumped into him. I stumbled back as his powerful body hit me like a brick wall.  How had I not seen him?
"Sorry." I mumbled as I looked up.
He stood in the shadows with a frown on his face, towering over my short 5' 2" frame.  His light blue eyes pierced with a glare as I was forced to look away. I knew who this was.
"Please forgive me, Alpha."
For a moment there was silence until he whispered, "The pleasure was all mine."
I looked up into his eyes again, shock clearly written on my face.  I didn't know I had my mouth open in a gasp until he chucked me gently under my chin closing my mouth.  He lingered his fingers against my jaw for a moment before he dropped his hand.  I was completely speechless.  The Alpha had never taken notice of me before, why the sudden interest? I watched him as he retreated into the darkness.  My heart pounded as stared at the space where he had stood not moments before.
What the hell just happened?
