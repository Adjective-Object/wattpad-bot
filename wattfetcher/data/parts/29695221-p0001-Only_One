I was sitting alone at my house. Well really it was my parents' house before they died. I feel like an only child because I have an older brother, but I never see him because he moved to America and I live in Doncaster, England. Oh let me introduce myself. I am Emma Adams and I am 22 years old. I live by myself, but I don't get very lonely since Lottie is always over because we are the beat of friends. Yes Lottie as in Lottie Tomlinson, my ex- best friend's little sister. Lottie has been there for me since Louis decided to never contact me ever again. I still have his number in my phone since I haven't been brave enough to delete it. Lottie said Louis will becoming to visit soon. I can only hope he will come and visit me for once.
Louis' POV
I am so glad to be finished with this album. I get to go home and see my mum, sisters, and step dad. I hope Emma still lives in her house she did live in before. Every time I come and visit I am too chicken to go knock on her door. I know Lottie is best friends with her, but I'm too afraid to ask for her number because I think Emma doesn't wanna see me. I have Emma's number, but I'm pretty sure this is an old number. I ma bringing Eleanor with me to visit my family. She hasn't seen them in a while. I think the last time she saw them was before we started to make Midnight Memories because she couldn't make it to see them during Thanksgiving or Christmas. Sometimes I feel like we are falling out of love. I don't feel the spark every time we kiss only sometimes. I love her, but I feel like I'm falling out of love and I know she feels it too. I can't wait to be back in Doncaster and out of London.
Authors noteThis is just a short chapter from both POV'S. If I doesn't say what POV it is it is automatically Emma's POV. The rest of them will say who's POV it is. I think I'm going to have Andrea Russet play Emma in this story because Andrea will be the perfect person to play Emma.Gracie
