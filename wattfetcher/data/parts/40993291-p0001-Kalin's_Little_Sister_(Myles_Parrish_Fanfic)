Hi. I'm Kriselle. I really don't have anything to say because my life was legit. I'm about 5'3, I have blonde hair, and green eyes (A/N:cover pic) oh and I'm related to Kalin White from "Kalin and Myles" How? My mom married his Dad. Soooo yeah. And I'm currently living with him because I had an argument with my Mom and we took it too far. So far it's just me, him, and his best friend Myles. He LIKES me. He's cute and all but I really don't know if I think about him like that.
A/N: Hey guys! This is just the intro. I wanted you to know about her so yeah. Enjoy!
