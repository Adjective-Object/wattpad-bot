On the first day of the third week, I thought I heard something different. What i found was a shrill voice. It was the rake. I can't listen to it long enough to even begin to transcribe it. I haven't let anyone listen to it yet. All I know is that I've heard it before, and now I believe that it spoke when it was sitting in front of my husband. I don't remember hearing anything at the time, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment.
The thoughts that must have gone through my daughters head made me very upset.
I have not seen the rake since he ruined my life, but I know that he has been in my room while I slept. I know and fear that one night I'll wake to see him staring at me.
