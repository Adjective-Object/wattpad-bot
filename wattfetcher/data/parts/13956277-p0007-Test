---------------
After they made sure Damon was fine, We headed to the kitchen to have breakfast.
"Mrs.Carter, why don't you take a seat and I'll prepare the breakfast" I smiled widely, I actually didn't want to, but I only said that because I almost brok her son's rib cage, they don't know about that but I feel guilty ... He deserved it anyway.
She agreed and Elina came with me to give me some help.
I made hommos and falafel 'which is an arabian food', eggs and some tea.
"It's ready" I called them.
"why dont you sit with us" Damon winked at me -_-
"Im not hungry thank you" I rolled my eyes. astaghferollah he's driving me crazy
after they finished they came to the living room and Mr.Carter started to clear his throat which meant that he needed our attention.
"So Leena, tomorrow Im leaving, I got some buisseness in Canada and Mrs.Carter will be at work all day, that's why we want you to stay here because Elina needs a big sister to help her and to stand beside her" he said
"will damon be with you" I asked, Damon gave me an evil smirk which meant no
"well, sorry I cant, Thank you for everything but I cant, and now excuse me because I need to call the jordanian embassy to fix the things" I went upstairs and dialled the number on my phone.
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY I CANT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE" I shouted
"Dont be angry, you signed the papers and agreed to live with that family" the man said
"But That's not the family you told me about" I lowered my voice
"Well, sorry" he said
"Now where am I gonna go" I asked
"haha nowhere" he chuckled
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NO WHERE "I screamed
"Can you please calm down, I might need my eardrums someday, I mean that you'll stay with that family" he answered
"NO I WONT ! I WANT TO GO HOME" I shouted
"well sorry, you and your father signed the papers and you can't go back or change the family, now excuse me I got more important things to do" He shut the phone
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" I said as loud as I could and everyone ran to my room.
"What's wrong honey " Mrs.Carter asked.
" I cant go back home and I can't go somewhere else" I cried
"Why are you crying" Elina hugged me
"because it's wrong everything is wrong, it's forbidden to live with foregin men it's haram" I cried
"Welcome to the family" Damon said
"SHUT UP, I need to call my parents" I took my phone and called.
"So?" Elina asked
"The answering machine said that they left to take a holiday in turkey, now I can't reach them, their phones are not available and they dont have Emails... I'll have to wait until they get back and listen to the message I left" I answered .
