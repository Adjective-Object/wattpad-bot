"What a dick." I said and leaned back onto my bunk, "Guys like that aren't worth it."
"He was though, I was with him for almost three years."
"Yeah but obviously it wasn't if he can't trust you to go on tour for three months then he needs to reevaluate the relationship."
"But he was always like that."
"He never trusted you?" I asked shocked.
"It depends on his mood, I guess. He was the love of my life and I lost him. God, I fucked up."
"Alan that doesn't really sound like a healthy kind of relationship." I told him furrowing my brow.
He looked at me shaking his head, "I don't see why it's not. He just had trust issues, people have them so what."
"Yeah but any guy who doesn't trust you isn't one worth staying with."
"He did trust me."
"Obviously not or else he wouldn't have just broken up with you." I pointed out.
"I should have asked him before I came on this. I mean I just kind of left."
"Don't try to take up for him." I said starting to get irritated. I really hate when guys think they can control their significant other. It's disgusting.
He shrugged and looked down at the ground not saying anything. His shoulders shook a little as he took a deep breath.
"Don't worry kid, everything will be fine. Your ex will figure it out or you will." I told him staring up at the ceiling with my hands behind my head.
He didn't say anything but get into his bunk. It was silent for a few minutes before I heard his muffled cries. I felt so awkward, I didn't know what to do in that moment. I don't do crying, I don't really know how to comfort people. Â I felt like an asshole for just sitting there but I really had no idea if I should hug him or what. I climbed out of my bunk and awkwardly sat at the edge of his and patted his back softly.
"There, there." I said, "You'll be fine."
He didn't say anything as he kept sobbing. Man, this guy must have really been something to him even if he was a dick.
"It's going to be fine?" I said unsure. I'm really bad at comforting people, I don't know how therapists fucking do it.
"He's a-all I had." He sobbed.
"Not anymore, now you have us." I said softly, "And I think a band full of idiots is ten times better than some dick who doesn't trust you."
He turned around and looked at me, "You're right. I shouldn't d-dwell over some guy I've wasted two years of my life on."
I smiled and felt the bus stop, "Exactly, now come on I think we're at the hotel." I told him and stood up.
He nodded, "Can you tell I've been crying?"
I wiped a tear from his cheek and shook my head, "Not really. I think you'll be fine."
He sniffled, "Uh, thanks."
"No problem, now come on the guys are probably waiting for us."
I got up and he did the same following me out to the guys.
Aaron glared at me when Alan and I came walking out, "What were you two doing back there?" He demanded.
"Just talking." Alan said looking at me and smiling a little
"Okay well were at the hotel." Tino said, "We're staying here tonight then we set off for sure tomorrow."
