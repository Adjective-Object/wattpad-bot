"Yes." He says seriously.
I give him a small smile. I pull out my small pocket mirror and evaluate the wound. "That's gonna leave a wicked scar." I say sadly.
"Yeah, sorry about that." Jeff apologizes. "But you're alive, and this profession isn't exactly all about looks."
"My hair looks kinda cool." I shrug.
"It also looks kind of dry and sad. Because bleach." Jeff says.
"Oh hush." I shush him, as I tie my hair in a bun. "I'm going to rest. This night has been slightly traumatic and I would like to forget about it entirely." I stand up and begin to walk to the hall.
"Hey Lena?" Jeff asks.
I turn. "Yeah?"
"Why does none of this scare you? Why don't I scare you?" He asks me.
I think for a couple seconds, and come up with nothing. "I don't know. I guess I'm just.. different." I shrug and walk away.

Jeff's POV
She's... different. Is that why I'm so attracted to her?

NOTE: understand that when REAL bleach comes into contact with your hair, it DOES NOT go white/blonde. IT DOES turn into a weird orange color, damages your scalp, ruins hair growth and can even make you go bald. I just made it that way for the sake of the plot and the fact that a Smeagol look-a-like is not who I want as the leading lady in my story. Thank you, and please don't try to dye your hair with Clorox.
