"I see Jaycie took my place for being in trouble. I was just having a hard time to find a flight to the states from China. I just went to Japan then waited a week to get to Hawaii and did the same then got to get a flight here only a city away. I got lost, but I found my way back." I said.
"Well where's your mother?"
"She won't be here. She went home." I said.
"What? Why?"
"Because she got sick and went up to go home." I said.
"Oh. Alex, I'm..."
"Naw Dad it's fine. I've been over it for a while. Mom wasn't the best when you left any way. I hadn't had contact with her since I was 13, when I was allowed to go to college I took the opportunity."
"You mean she gave you up?" He asked.
"Dad, Mom was a quitter and she was alcoholic and a smoker. I think I was better off without that before I was 6."
"She did that?" Dad sighed. "I knew I should of taken you with me."
"It's fine Dad. I'm 19 and I get to travel like she said I should do."
"She?"
"Yeah, Jaycie and Paul's mom. She saw me and we had met twice. She had told me how you were when I asked and she suggested for me to travel."
He smiled lightly.
"So you took her advice?"
"Yeah. Why don't we go and get Jaycie's work that she missed? I could help her catch up."
Dad smiled and decided that was a good idea after I met the Alpha and Beta.

*Paul's POV*
"Paul, where's my brother?" Tessa asked.
"Well, he and the others were protecting people and the police came and they were taken for questioning." I answered.
"They? What did they do?"
"They are Jaycie, Justin, Morse, Chase, Lakyn, and Chasten. They were fighting rouges."
"Paul! Come here." Dad called.
"Who's that, Paul?"
"That's my Dad. Come with me. You can meet my Dad." I said extending my hand and smiling gently at her.
She looked back at my dad and then at my hand. She smiled and nodded. I took her hand and walked her over. I smiled the whole way as I felt the tingles. She and I were there in a few minutes.
"Hey Dad. This is Tessa my mate. Tessa this is my Dad." I said.
My Dad's eyes shined with happiness.
"Oh my! You are very pretty! It's nice to meet you, Tessa! You can call me Derrick." My Dad said shaking her other hand.
"It's nice to meet you Mr. Derrick."
"Oh, please just call me Derrick, Tessa."
I was truly surprised at that. Dad doesn't let anyone younger than him call him by his first name. My grin widened then I smelt something. It smelt like blood and a rouge. My eyes were on alert. I growled a low growl.
"Dad... What's that smell? It smells like..."
"There you are Paul! Hey Tessa! Why don't you come with me Tessa? Paul has to talk to his Dad. Now." Greg said with a glare towards my Dad.
