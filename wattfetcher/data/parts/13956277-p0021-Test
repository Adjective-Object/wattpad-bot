"I'm ready let's go" Elina jumped on my back
"Don't you think that this short is really short?" I asked
"Yeah don't you?" Damon repeated
"Since when do you care about my outfits?" Elina kinda scolded Damon
"It's cold you better change" I said
"It's september" She raised and eyebrow
"It might get cold you don't know"
lately I've been trying to change her, for better of course, trying to make her dress longer and fix her attitude because she kinda doesn't have anyone to guide her, her mom is always working and her father aswell, her brother doesn't care and then I stepped in.
She always smiles but I notice sadness in her eyes and she tells me that she's missing something but she doesn't know what it is ... maybe it's Iman ?
