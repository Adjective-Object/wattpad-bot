So I was going through all of the books I wrote and wow, I feel as though I have come such a long way! I thank you all for supporting my artistry and respecting it as well. I appreciate the support immensely and I also thank everyone who's pushing me constantly and continually motivating me to go far with my writing.
I am an artist and I am SUPER sensitive about my shit in my Erykah Badu voice, and Yall know that! But you all continued to push me and i am so grateful for that.
I realize that apart of my calling is writing. I feel so passionately about doing it and you all helped me realize that.
And as I was reading Harmony's Journey I realized that from Harmony's Journey to Ava's World and Finding Joy I have grown tremendously and I can't help but thank Yall for reading, commenting, voting and sharing your stories with me. I am truly blessed to have you all apart of my life even though I don't know you all personally.
Thanks from the bottom of my heart.
