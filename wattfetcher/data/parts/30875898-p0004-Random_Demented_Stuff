It's hard to live, when I wan't to die
It's hard to tell the truth, when I see so many lies
It's hard to breathe, when I always get choked
It's hard to bleed, when all my razors get evoked
It's hard to love, when I only felt hate
It's hard to trust, when I have zero fate
It's to want, when I have nothing I need
It's hard to follow, when there's no one to lead
It's hard to fly when I'm stuck on the ground
It's hard to hear, when there isn't a sound
It's hard to go, when I keep getting stopped
It's hard to grow, when I keep getting cropped
It's hard to move, when I stay in one place
It's hard to be okay when I'm going insane
It's hard to be together, when you're so far away
It's hard to talk, when I have nothing to say
It's hard to find, when I can only loose
It's hard to pick, when I have nothing to choose
It's hard to learn, when no one will teach
It's hard to pray, when there isn't a priest
it's hard to swim, when there's no water left
It's hard to give, when I only see theft
It's hard to smile, when I want to cry
It;s hard to live, when I want to die
