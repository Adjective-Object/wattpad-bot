Ian's arm moved at what seemed like fifty miles an hour to Jade's slowly processing mind. His fist came in contact with a blurry blob of what Jade thought was skin, which she soon discovered was a face. Red flew from the peachy blur in a glob of spit. Punch after punch after punch; the sound of fist coming in contact with jaw and nose was enough to make Jade cringe. She'd never seen Ian act that way before. Well, she had, but it was a long, long time ago...
He took one final measure and gripped the back of the man's head tightly. He mumbled something inaudible and slammed the not-so-much-a-menacing-face-anymore against the wall, then let go and watched as the guy collapsed to the ground, hopefully only unconscious. Ian let his eyes wander across the shop until they found Jade, who was still rapidly gasping for breath. His eyes lit up with worry and he was by her side in no time and on his knees. Carefully, he placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, not wanting to harm her any further.
"Like I said, you have the worst timing ever," Jade forced out in a raspy voice. He let out a nervous laugh and stood up, then ran behind the counter and began shouting for a phone. Jade took in the wreckage while she waited for him to return. Tables and chairs were laying haphazardly on their sides, glass was sprinkled across the floor like the toppings offered at the shop, and people were staring at her in concern. Especially the couple that had been looking at her funny earlier.
Sirens filled her ears and she winced at the pain it caused to her throbbing head. It felt like her brain was pounding against her skull. When the black blotches dotted her vision she didn't fight against them, instead she welcomed them. They took over first her vision, then her hearing, then diminished any other working senses. She only had time for one thought before the darkness of this inevitable sleep enveloped her.
At least the worst is over, right?
