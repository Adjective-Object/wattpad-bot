I ship it....but she doesn't love him. I made her emotionless towards him because in Bluestar's Prophecy, she never felt anything towards him more than a Clanmate. The nice things he's done for her and then she has Oakheart's kits which breaks his heart. At first Bluefur HATED Oakheart because she thought he was almost exactly like Thistlepaw (Thistleclaw.) but came to love him.  The art in this is so bad xD (I switched to this style for a little cuz this is my style when I am animating so I don't have to make realistic art 500 times to animate it. So I made this simple lineart for animating.)
