I ABSOLUTLY HATE FINDING BUGS IN MY FOOD!!! I MEAN DOESN'T EVERYONE!!
Seriously once I was eating making a cold roll to eat (DUH) then I found a fly literally laminated in rice paper.
Then another time I had a coke slushy/krazy krush with one of my besties
@katiemaguire2003 and after I finished it I found little pieces of ants in my drink.

Have you ever found something like this in your drink?
