---Chapter XIV: Goodbye (Part 3)---
Italy and Germany, who were still stuck in the second time loop, searched around the mansion for the missing journal. When they were down in the second floor, they walked to the bottom left hall and went inside a room that had bookshelves they could browse through, but to no avail. The journal was still nowhere to be found.
"The journal is not here..." Italy sighed. They decided to exit the room and look somewhere else, just then, they heard voices on the other side of the hall.

Italy gasped. "Oh, no! They're right over there! Hide, Germany!" he said, pulling Germany to a hall farther from where the past countries were.

"...Is there some kind of trouble? They're making quite a ruckus." Germany wondered.

Some of the nations of the second time loop were gathered in the right hall nearby the stairs.

"Italy is...dead?" Past Russia asked in a low voice.

Past America looked away. "...You'd better not look. England is preparing the room now, but...It looks really bad..."

Just then, Past England exits the bottom room in front of the fireplace room. "England!" Past Japan exclaimed in surprise.




"I've taken care of the room. And his wounds, too, sort of. France has been holding up pretty well, but...Germany is still very disoriented..." Past England told them, rubbing his arm nervously.

Italy creased his forehead upon hearing the past nation's conversation. "I'm...dead?"


"Well, you told me this was the second time loop, but maybe you were mistaken?" Germany suggested.

Italy shook his head and frowned. "No way! I'm sure this is the second time loop!"

"Quiet! They'll hear you." Germany hushed him.

Italy covered his mouth on reflex. After a moment, he spoke, "Sorry...Now that I think about it, Japan and America did say that I'd died in the second time loop. Maybe...That's it? But wait...Then, the one I know is..."

Past England held up a book in his hands and turned it to the first page. "Italy Veneziano...The name of the journal's owner...no, that can't be it. This looks more like a...a contract sign." he recited, growing confused at what he read. He decided to turn to the next page. "Let's see what's written inside...What the hell!? R-Ruse to go back in time?" he exclaimed.
-=-=-==-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-
"Ah. They're talking about your journal." Germany confirmed.
Italy nodded, but then looked up in thought. "Yeah. If I died, that means there's no one to go back in time, right? I wonder what that means..."
