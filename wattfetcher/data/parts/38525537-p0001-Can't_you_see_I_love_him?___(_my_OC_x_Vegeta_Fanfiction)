Hello everybody!This is my 3RD story on Wattpad!I'm writing this because Vegeta is my favorite character and my bae in DBZ!So that's why I wanna write this.Vegeta and Sky are in high-school and Sky has NO friends, but later in she becomes friends with Goku and Vegeta.Anyway lets get started!🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀🌀Sky's POVAs I walk into Science class, I get stares as I head to my desk, my blue hair always make people stare.The teacher wasn't in the room, so I begin to read a really good book on Saiyan cultures, until Mackenzie ( random name) comes over."Hey goth, whatcha reading, a book on how to be smart?" she says in a bitch like way."No I'm reading on my culture you idiot, can you not read the title?" I say back."Ugh you @sshole!" She says slapping my face, making me fall to the door with all my stuff going down with me."Don't EVER talk like that to me again!" She says walking off.A boy that I see in basically all my classes comes over to help me."Here let me help you" he says kneeling down to help."I'm Goku by the way" he says smiling as he picks up my Saiyan cultures book " your a saiyan?" he asks."Why are you?" "Yeah I am actually, anyway what's your name?" He asks."Sky" "Well you wanna sit with me at lunch?" Goku asks."Um.... sure" I say standing up."Great! see you at lunch!" He say jogging back to his seat."Ok.. weird..." I say sitting back in my chair.The bell rings and mrs. Electra ( again random) walks in, with a rather cute boy next to her."Class, this is Vegeta, he is our new student so be nice, Vegeta go sit next to Sky." mrs. Electra announces.The boy walks over and sits his stuff down.He had anti- gravity hair that stayed stuck up that was the common color for saiyans. He wore a blue t- shirt that showed his muscles that were pretty big. he also wore black jeans too.Mrs Electra began her lesson, but I just focused on Vegeta.
Time skip to the end of class....When the bell rang, Vegeta walked out pretty quick so I ran up to him."Wait!""What is it women?" He says."I wanted to ask you.... wanna sit with me at lunch?" I say a bit quiet."Ugh fine but I gotta go, goodbye" Vegeta says then walks to his locker, which is right by mine."Maybe... other than that Goku guy... I can have another friend!" I say quietly, then walk to my locker.
Another time skip to Lunch....
I walked to lunch hoping Vegeta would sit with me.As I walk into the cafeteria, I see Goku at a table, with a bald headed short guy."Hey Goku! who's this?" I say sitting down next to Goku."Oh this is Krillin, Krillin this is Sky" Goku says."Sup" he says."Sup" I reply."You don't mind that I asked the new kid to sit here... right?" I say nervously."No that's ok we need more people anyway" Krillin says.In a matter of minutes, Vegeta walks out of the lunch line and sees me and sits down next to me."Who are these idiots?" he says sitting down.Goku is like the nicest person, he ignores Vegeta and says."Well you know Sky... I'm Goku and this is Krillin""Hi" Krillin says."Hello earthling" Vegeta responds."Are you a saiyan?" I ask."Yes I'm a Saiyan... I know you and Goku are too... I can sense you energy" he responds."Oh ok" I say going back to my meal.Goku and Krillin basically ignore me and Vegeta, so we chatted all through lunch.After lunch I headed to my Locker, only to be shoved by Mackenzie, dropping all my stuff."Hey, I never finished with you bitch, time for payback" she says.She starts to punched and kick me and basically beats the shit out of me until I hear someone yell."BACK OFF HER YOU BITCH!"Mackenzie gets shooted with a energy blast and I get picked up, only to black out thinking....That voice.....I think it was Vegeta.....❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄Cliff hanger!Next part up tomorrow!Vegeta's POV is next!
