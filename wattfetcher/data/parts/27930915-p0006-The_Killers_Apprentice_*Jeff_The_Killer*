I wake up to the smell of bacon. I've never smelled something so pleasant just as I awake. My mother died after having me, and my dad well, he became and alcoholic and.. you know the rest. He was never home, sometimes he'd go out of town for weeks, months, even. Usually my auntie Sally would pay bills when he was away, Sally was good to me. She never knew about what my dad did to me, and I'm starting to regret keeping it to myself. two summers ago, right after my 18th birthday, she died. Thank god the timing was right or else I wouldn't be able to have kept the house. But I was legally an adult. I had graduated high school, and I got a job. But never in my life have I woken up and smelled a home cooked breakfast.
I climb out of bed and walk down the long dark hallway. I reach the main space, and Jeff is cooking. Smile is asleep on the sofa.
"Good morning Lena." His deep and gravely voice says to me.
"Good morning." I give him a small smile. As I approach him, I realize he isn't wearing a shirt. I can feel my cheeks fill with color and I quickly look at my feet.
"I made bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes.. Help yourself." Jeff says.
"It's not human meat or anything, right?" I ask him.
"I'm a serial killer, not a monster."
I nod and ask where the plates are. He fetches one for me and piles food onto it. I sit at the dining table.
"Thank you Jeff." I thank him as I stuff my face with food.
"You're welcome." He nods and sits across from me with his own plate.
"So, let's talk."
"Talk about what?" He asks.
"Your first kill." I arch my brow and he furrows his, recognizing that I am mocking what he did to me last night.
"You haven't earned the right to know my story, Lena." Jeff says, very seriously.
"Then at least tell me who did this to you?" I ask.
"It.." He sighs. "It was me. Well, most of it anyway. I burnt off my eyelids and carved a permanent smile."
"And your skin?"
"My skin is another story." He snaps.
"Alright." I nod.
A minute of silence passes before Jeff speaks again.
"Well?"
"Well what?" I ask.
"I just told you I burnt my eyelids off. And carved a smile in my cheeks." He reminds me.
"Yes, you did." I nod.
"React!" He snaps. "Say something, look shocked, gasp, do something!"
"What? Why?" I ask.
"Because everyone does something! Every single person who sees me!"
I shrug. "It doesn't bother me much."
"My face doesn't bother you?"
"Well only for about 5 minutes."
"And the fact that I did this to myself?"
"I am not in any position to judge you." I tell him. "I'm sure you had your reasons at the time, whatever those reasons may be."
"I don't disgust you?" He asks, leaning in closer. "This doesn't repulse you?"
I shake my head.
Jeff slams his fists on the table, making me and my food jump. He turns away and mumbles something I can't hear. Jeff confuses me, his emotions are all over the place, no matter what I do.
