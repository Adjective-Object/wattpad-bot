Amanda: Ok fine, I'll tell you...
She took a deep breath in and let it out.
Amanda: It was....... Zach.
I was in shock, millions of things were going through my mind. All I knew was that I was gonna wind up in jail. I cried even more, I put my arms around her waist and my face in her lap. She tangled her hand in my hair.
Me: No! No, no, no, no, no!!
Amanda: I tried to fight back but then he tied my wrist to the bed and then he........
She started to cry a lot more. I hugged her tighter because of what I just heard.
Me: Was it just him or was there more people?
Amanda: It was just him.
Quadira's P.O.V.
Amanda and Austin walked out of the bathroom and they were both crying. I started to get emotional myself. Amanda sat on the couch and Austin was on his knees in front of her.
Austin: I don't know how to react to this. Did you get to see who it was?
