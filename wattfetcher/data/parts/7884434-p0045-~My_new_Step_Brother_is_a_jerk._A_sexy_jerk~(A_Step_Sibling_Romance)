He leans down and gently presses his lips to mine, a bolt of electricity running through my body. My hands go up and gently hold his handsome face.
God his lips.
I run my hands through his silky black hair, his lip piercing feeling cold against my lip. I gently start to move my lips against his, in a slow passionate movement. His hand runs slowly down my body and it literally feels like heaven.
One thing all of you should know about love, things never feel the same with any one else. The person you love will leave you breathless and everything will literally feel so perfect you wont even have the right words to describe it.
When im with Seth.. God i've never felt anything like it.. Just his smile makes me want to melt..
Seth slowly pulls his lips from mine, and he starts placing small kisses down my jaw. My eyes stay closed and I slowly throw my head back, loving the feeling. My mind just completely shuts out all the memories of Casper. Its just me and Seth. The feelings, are just me and Seth. The actions, are just me and Seth. No one else.
I run my small hand into his hair and gently tug on it, earning a soft groan from his plump lips.
My body shivers and my skin erupts with goosebumps as his lips kiss at my neck and suck at my neck, earning a soft moan from now my swollen pink lips.
"B-Baby" I breath through a soft moan, a blush on my cheeks. Seth slowly kisses back up my neck and jawline and he gently kisses my lips.
He then lays down next to me and pulls my back into his chest. "You're mine now Shea. You have a nice mark now to prove it" he whispers in my ear as he gently nips at my earlobe.
"Seth! You left a hickey on my neck!?" I say through a laugh and I turn towards him. He's laying there a smug smile on his face. Hes proud of himself.
"Yes I did love bug" He whispers as he softly kisses my lips again.
"What if my mom or your dad sees it?" I whisper
"Just say someone else gave it to you" he laughs.
"Lisa is gonna know. You know that" I laugh and he does too.
"That girl knows a lot for being 10" He says shaking his head.
"Remember when she caught you feeling me up!?" I ask laughing.
"Hey! Shush haha, you loved it" he says with a chuckle.
"Not when Lisa was watching!" I laugh again and then cuddle into him.
He chuckles softly "Get some sleep love bug" He whispers and then kisses my forehead. "I love you Shea" He whispers to me.
I yawn and cuddle into his warmth. My small hands rested on his chest. "I love you too Seth" and after those words, i was fast asleep in his arms.
