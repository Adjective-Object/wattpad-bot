Dance to the rhythm of the falling stars,
Laugh at the sky with me,
And point out passing cars.
I don't have to be scared if I have you.
You save me from all of it.
I don't know what to do
To express my gratitude for all that you've done.
I need you more than I even realize,
Like the moon needs the sun
To shine.
