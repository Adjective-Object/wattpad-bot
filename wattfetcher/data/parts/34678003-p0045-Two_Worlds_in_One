I still stood in the wall watching Chase get the checkered flag and then start the burn out. Still standing on the wall - I turned around to see his parents, standing right behind me, smiling from ear to ear. Then Chase's pit crew started running down pit road to get to victory lane. His crew chief came down from the pit box and he, Chase's parents and I started jogging down to victory lane.
We were all standing and waiting for Chase as he rolled into victory lane. He climbed on the winds and did a fist pump in the air and then jumped to the ground. Instead of popping champagne we all sprayed water and orange and blue Gatorade everywhere. Then Chase was handing the Monster Mile trophy he and his crew chief proudly held up.
After most of the mayhem calmed down it was hat dance time. Wow - I've never ever experienced this before. I mean I was kinda in the middle to the end because to most people here they had no clue who I was. Chase's parents were up front with Chase. Finally, after all the hat dancing the crowd taking our picture and interviewing Chase dissipated. As did the crowd all in the hat dance - now Chase was taking pictures and selfies with his mom, then his dad then both, then just him and his crew chief and finally just by him self with the trophy. Chase and his crew chief had to pack up the heavy Monster trophy and then had to go into the press and media interview. I know he couldn't really stop and chit-chat with me but as he walked by me he squeezed my hand real quick and flashed me a smile. "Meet you in the Motorhome when I'm done!" He said as he walked away.
