"Hello Son residence"
^Chi Chi it's me Bulma umm how do I say this. My father died and his funeral will be this weekend. Would you like to come? You can stay here at C.C^
Chi Chi knowing her best friend needed her decided it would be right.
"We'll head out right now"
^Okay how many rooms^
"One for me and Goku and another for Pan and Goten"
^You have a girl! Oh my Kami we could go shopping and dress her up! I also have a daughter and a boy!^
"That would be great but Pan doesn't like that kind of stuff. Jeje she loves to train. I tried to get her in a dress and boy was she mad . Wait a second you have two children too. This is great so many play dates!"
^ So I'll see you here then^
"You most certainly would"
Me: first chap done woop woop
