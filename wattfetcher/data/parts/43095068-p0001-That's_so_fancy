Emma Heights, the queen bee? Emma Heights, the best dressed? Emma Heights the hottest girl in school?
She has been there all her life. At least, that's what her friends told her. Having brown wavy hair and light freckles weren't that attractive. Unless, you see the beautiful blue bright eyes. Emma is a very popped out person.
In easier words, someone can spot her in a mile. Maybe that's because of her bright clothes and Prada bags. Or maybe her shoes and very curly hair. She looks like a very confident girl but really, she is a very shy person.
Emma's dream was to become a model or fashion designer. It was perfect for her. She had that tall and skinny body. She also had the techniques of the designer. Believe it or not, she actually designed her own cardigan.
It was flowered with white and black. Girls would always feel it and "try" to copy it. But it was indeed to much talent in it.
All Emma wants is for someone to take a look at her designs. only her friends and family were the ones to see it. Though there was this one girl, Rebekah, who always tried to copy her.
She always tries to copy what Emma is wearing. For instance, Emma was wearing a simple black knit and cotton filled fitted dress with Ayers Snakeskin Lace-up shoes. Next thing you know, here comes Rebekah wearing the exact same thing. Emma took care of it but know one knew what she did. Well, she won't tell anyone.
People loved Emma but sometimes she was a mystery. Friends knew where she lived and stuff but no one knew about her family and her boyfriend. She told no one about herself even though she knew every secret about everyone.
For a popular girl, she was a little odd. No one was mean to her and everyone stood back when she was close to them. They didn't want to trip Emma because they were trying to be nice.
