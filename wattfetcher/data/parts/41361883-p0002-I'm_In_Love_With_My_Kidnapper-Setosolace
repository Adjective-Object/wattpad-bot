I didn't know or care at the moment. I laid on the bed and closed my eyes.
I guess it could be worse...I could of been stuck with a total stranger who rapes and abuses me...
I woke up later that day, I could hear Seto's voice trying to wake me up. I groaned, "what?" I asked irritated. "It's dinner time and I want to ask if you were hungry..." Seto muttered quietly. I sighed, "yeah, I'm hungry." I quietly said back.
"Follow me, please." Seto said, I got up and followed him out of the room. We walked down the stairs and into another room, the kitchen.
It was somewhat messy, but not too much. Seto looked at me, "so, what do you want to eat?" He asked me. I sighed, "anything I don't care...pancakes I guess." I mumbled. Seto nodded and started pulling out supplies from his coverts.
I sat at the round wooden table. I was depressed, I didn't want to be stuck here forever...maybe, just a maybe...I can try wining over Seto's trust...maybe he'll let me go...or I can find a way out...
It seemed like a really cruel thing to fake a friendship and betray him, but he kidnapped me against my will! I was willing to try anything to get out of this guy's house.
A few minutes passed and Seto put a plate in front of me, it had pancakes on it. He put a fork right next to the plate and also some syrup. "Uh, you want a drink?" Seto asked me. "Sure, Water." I said. Seto nodded and grabbed a glass of water and ran it under the kitchen sink. He handed me the glass.
"Thanks..." I muttered. I took a small sip of the water and place the glass on the table. I heard Seto sigh and walk out of the kitchen, where was he going? I ignored it. I poured syrup on my pancakes and started eating.
A/N
Okay, to keep this authors note short I'm just gonna say I didn't like my first Setosolace story, it wasn't that well written. So here's my other chance. Hope you enjoy!
