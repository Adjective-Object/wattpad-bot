This is my first Phanfiction and I hope you enjoy it >>>---Ellie and Emma were sat on Ellie's Bed while on their laptop scrolling through Twitter."EMMA!" Ellie squeals as she sees the Vidcon tickets appear on her laptop."WHAT?" she looks over at the laptop "OH MY LORD" she smiles and squeals, they both get up and jump around and fangirl."we need to order them like now." Ellie said seriously "Agreed." Emma said as they slumped down onto the bed again. Ellie proceeded with her order and they got the weekend trip."Guess what?" Ellie said smiling "What?" Emma looked puzzled "WERE GOING TO VIDCON!" Ellie shouted as they both stood up and did a victory dance.---I know that this was a short chapter but this is my first one I hope you enjoyed it!
