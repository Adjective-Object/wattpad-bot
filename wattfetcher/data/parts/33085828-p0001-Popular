Mackenzie's POV Today is the first day of school! I'm excited because I moved to Florida.
Since it was the first day of a fresh start and without Maddie, I wanted to look nice.
I wore Maddie's favorite dress and sandals. After an hour and a half of getting ready, mom made me bacon and fruit salad.
"Kenzie, have fun at school honey." Mom smiled at me as if I was going to have fun. I smiled back and ran to my new bus.
When I got on the bus I saw a whole bunch of people I didn't know. I kind of wished Maddie was here, she'd help me make friends.---------ONE BUS RIDE LATER----This is it! My new school! I was excited at first because it's new, but it's school, no one likes it.
"Asia!" I heard a girl calling. "What is wrong with you?" I tried not to look but they were beside my locker!
"Nothing can be wrong with me, I'm perfect." She smiled.
"Really? Nothing is wrong with you stealing my boyfriend?!" The girl was ticked off. Her face cherry red and her voice was very ticked.
"Oops did I do that? I'm sorry not sorry. I think it's time you find someone new." Asia was for sure mean.
The girl ran away angered but crying. It wasn't very nice what Asia did to her.
Asia saw me walking as if nothing happened.
"Hey you! New girl!"
I paused and turned around with my face down.
"Um hi. My name is.."
"No one cares about your stupid name. Ok?" She interrupted.
"Well atleast my mom didn't want my name to be a country." I rolled my eyes and continued walking.
Asia and her friends walked after me. One pulled my hair, Asia kicked me, and the other girl throwing pencils at me.
"Call me a name again and your ugly face will be even uglier! Oh and BTW I'm popular and your a nerd, so I'd watch out.
They all walked away laughing hysterically. I picked up my stuff and went to the restroom to fix my hair.________________________
