"This is not the time to be speaking Zayn," Harry glared at him and I walked away. I need to go. I need to get away from this.. this place.
"Where the hell do you think you're going?!" Harry followed me into his room. I grabbed some clothes and put them in a bag.
"Away," I softly said. I'm done arguing for today.
"To the city?" He asked calmly. Well, for now.
"Yes," I paused, "Just away from you."
"You can't go out there alone," he huffed. Who's he to tell me what to do?
"Watch me,"
"No seriously, it's dangerous,"
"I'm not ten years old, Harry. I'm pretty sure I can hold my own ground out there," I rolled my eyes.
"Please just stay, I'll leave you alone,"
"No," I walked to the front door, "Bye Harry."

The cold, New York City wind hits my cheeks making them a crimson. I really hate winter sometimes. Although, it is beautiful when snow falls.
I don't have any certain places to go to, but my first destination I arrive at is Starbucks. I need something to warm up my body and hot coffee seems like the best option right now.
The line, of course, is long. I look over at the same table from coming here the other day. It reminds me of my sister's betrayal.
Before I even notice, I'm next to order. It takes the guy at the counter to call me four times.
"Sorry, I was thinking," I awkwardly chuckle and so does the guy. It's the same one from a few days ago.
"Lennon, right?" He smiles. I guess he remembers my name from last time and I nod as he writes my name on the cup. I order a white chocolate cappuccino.
"I think they're going to hire you," he says, "I heard them talking about you."
"That's awesome," I gleam and grab my drink to head out.
"Bye Lennon," he has a cheeky grin on his face. It kind of reminds me of Harry..
No, stop it Lennon! He's no good for you. My conscience decides to remind me.
"Good bye," I wave and leave the shop.

I've been walking around the city for about four hours now and it's about five o'clock. I would love to go back to the apartment, but I can't. I don't want to see, hear, or talk to Harry.
I tried calling Eleanor to see if she would bother to come shopping with me. Unfortunately, she didn't answer.
"Lennon!" A familiar voice shouts behind me. I turn around to see the face of the sound. It's Harry and he's about ten feet behind me. So I decide to do what seems to be my best option and run away. I end up finding an alleyway and sit there for a few minutes. Harry probably lost me by now.
"Thank God," I sigh.
I can see a shadow from the corner of my eye forming and before I know it, the daylight turns to pitch black.
HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY HARRRYYYYY!!!! OMGGG HES GETTING OLDER AND OLDERRR! WTF.
