So,hello everyone:DWell,this is my first fan fiction,so I'm sorry if it sucks,I will try my best:(
Louis' POV
"You are just a mistake,Louis,a failature!",my father yells.I shut the door behind me,as my parents are still yelling at me.I'm so sick of them...Why can't they just accept me the way I am?It isn't that bad being gay...Is it?As I was thinking these,my parents come into my room."What's wrong with you,Louis..?",my mother asks me."What's wrong with me?!I have done nothing wrong,mother,my only mistake was that I told you about me.I knew you two would never accept who I am!",I yell at them."You don't deserve to live here Louis.",my father told me and he left the room with my mother.
Zayn's POV
I am tired of driving,but I have to continue.In about twenty minutes,I will be in Doncaster.I hope everything will be as I have already planned cause I have no time for plan changes.
Louis' POV
So,I decided it.I'm running away.Running away from home,from my parents,from my family.It's not they will realize it,at least not soon.
~15 minutes later~
2:49 pm.I left without anyone notice,but I have absolutely no idea what I'm gonna do now or where I can stay.I guess I should spend the night in some hotel or whatever.But this freaking city is huge..Maybe I should ask someone to tell me where is a good hotel.I was looking for someone to ask,but there was none in the streets now.I was about to give up,until I saw a young man walking down the street and coming towards me.He was definitely older than me,but not so much...He had black,styled hair,tattoos in his arms and he was much taller than me.He was really beautiful..Only when I approached him,I notice his eyes..They were brown hazel with spills of golden.It was the kind of eyes you could get lost into them,and I couldn't help but stare at the stranger's beautiful eyes.He then talked to me."Hey",he told me.Whoah,even his voice was impressive..It was low,but deeper than mine and..Almost hypnotistic."Oh,hi..""Why aren't you at your house?Do you know how late it is?",he told ,but not looking as surprised as he wanted."Umm,I ran away.",I said awkardly.He gave me a weird look and then asked me:"Why would you ran away?""Family problems.",I said sharply."Oh..Anyway,my name's Zayn."That's a lovely name."Nice to meet you,Zayn..""The pleasure is all mine,Louis."I was about to answer,but then I realized what he said..How could he know my name?I hadn't told him almost anything about me,and definitely not my name.
Zayn's POV.
Fuck.Did I said this out loud?I think yes,cause now Louis' looking at me like he saw a ghost."How do you know what my name is?I haven't told you.""I have seen you many times before,when you were hanging out with your friends,and once, I just heard your name.",I said hoping he will believe me."Umm okay...",he answered.I don't think he believed me,but,thankfully,I guess he dropped it.I was lucky this time,but if I wanted this to go well,I have to be more careful."Anyway...Where are you gonna spend the night?""I have no idea.I wanted to ask you if you know any good hotel here...""Well,I know plenty of hotels here,but I don't think that they are open at 3:02pm.",I lied.Fortunately,he believed me."Then,what am I gonna do?",he said with a sad look."Hey,you can come to my house.I will let you stay as much as you want.""That's great,thank you Zayn.",he said,looking happy that he wouldn't sleep on the ground."But it's a little away,so I have to drive.",I told him."Okay,I don't mind."he said and smiled.His smile is so cute...
I'm sorry for the short chapter,I will try to make them much longer:(Please,vote and comment,it's pretty important,thank y'all x
