We were in a huge accessories shop, Simon was using is face, muscles and colorful eyes to attract girls and bring their emotions to the edge.
"That's too bad, I really want to know the details, can I have your number and then you'll explain the whole thing to me" A brunette guy pulled a poster from my hand, "There's a website that allows you to know more and more and it's written on the poster" I was in need for support, that's why I was extra sweet with him, "You can have my number, we are partners" Simon left the group of girls that was surrounding him and stepped in front of me, "I'll just go to the website" The guy walked away.
"Nobody misses with my cuppycake" Simon winked at me, it seemed like I had already heard this nickname before .. cuppycake... "Ew ! I'm nobody's cuppycake" I turned my head around and noticed men in black suits watching us, "Can you see that?" I whispered to Simon, "Ahmm, that's what I was about to tell you. Just act normal like you haven't noticed anything, 10 minutes and we'll leave" I nodded, "Keep this with you" I tucked a knife in his pocked, "I don't even want to know where you got this from".
When the shop became less crowded "Leena, they are walking closer to us" Simon whispered, "On three. One, two ... THREE, RUN" I caught the end of my Abaya then we raced our heart beats, we were way faster than the men who were after us but we didn't stop until we passed three neighborhoods and ended up standing exhausted on a summit of a mountain we didn't even know how we reached, "I think we lost them" Simon said as he had his palm on his chest that was going up and down insanely, I wasn't much better, I lied on the grassy ground, opened my arms and hugged the grass, "NO, DON'T EAT IT, I'll buy you something if you're too hungry" I rolled and lied on my back, looked at him, he was smiling, I chuckled, he laughed and then I started laughing hysterically, I wasn't laughing because of what he said, I didn't even know why I was laughing but he joined me, his laugh reached Australia and then fell beside me and started rolling on the grass while he was laughing, and so was I, "Wh-HAHA Wh-why are w-HAHA laughing?" Tears came out of his eyes as he was asking and laughing, I couldn't even answer because I was rolling, But I needed to laugh after all what I had been through, I needed it.
"Are you sure it's worth it?" Simon asked as he was sitting beside me but 20 feet away from and, we were watching the sunset and eating burger, "Totally", "So, where are we going tomorrow?" He asked, "To church" Simon choked, "Are you serious ?" He said in disbelief, "Yeah"I sighed, "Why ? You are Muslim ?" He stood up, "We need to help the girls, we need support, people listen to priests, if we could convince the priest, people will follow him. There's another relation that connects people other than religions" I said, "What?" He smiled, "Humanity" I sighed, "So, can humanity connect us and make a relationship between the both of us?" He winked, "You have to ruin the moment, don't you?" I chuckled.
.....
"Where have you been?" Karam asked as I opened the door, "Oh, hey ! Assalamu alaykum" I headed to the stairs, "I'm talking to you, don't just walk away" I wasn't a liar and I wont ever become one, but I was a good actor, so I threw myself on the ground and he ran to me and shook my head few times then I opened my eyes and he carried me to my room. And that's how you avoid talking about something you don't want to talk about, "It might be because of the chicken burger i had earlier" I said, "Just take a rest and you'll be fine" Karam kissed my forehead then left. He was such a sweet young uncle but I didn't want to tell him what I was doing because he would never agree and congratulate me. He would probably keep me in the house and look all the doors and windows. He was such a great and caring person and ran all the companies I had, our fortune went 15% higher in few months thanks to him. It hurt me so much that I had to hide things from him but he'd know everything at the perfect moment.
.....
I walked to my locker and pulled some books then accidentally made eye contact with Conor which I hadn't seen for a while, "Hey, I don't really know much about you or your religion, but the things I have read so far are interesting, I'm just reading for knowledge, but Miley broke up with me because of those books you've been spreading and I'll make you pay for it" What ? was he serious ? Who cared? I had other things to take care of.
