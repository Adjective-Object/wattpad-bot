With all four of them, it wasn't that difficult to fight off the alien-like creature. Spain and Romano still had a great amount of strength with them, physically and emotionally, so they were a great help in battle. After a few more attacks and hits, the monster finally disappeared just like it always does.
--------------------Italy's Party was victorious!

After catching their breaths, Germany turned to Italy and squinted. "You..."
"I thought it was going to come from the door, not from above..." Spain whispered.
Italy only shook his head and gave an apologetic look, "Sorry, he'll drop from above."
"Now it's too late!! You should have said it before it appeared, you bastard!" the Southern Italian scolded, making his younger brother flinch a little. He quickly regret his action and looked away. "Anyway, let's go to the 4th floor, quickly." he said as he opened the door to exit the room.
Italy suddenly felt a little panicked, "I said I was sorry! Oh, don't go ahead on your own! It's dangerous!" he called after his brother.
====================
I was going to monitor them further, when I felt my phone vibrate in pocket.

.....my phone?
I nervously reached for my pocket and took out my phone. Looking at the phone screen, I saw that someone was calling me. It was an unregistered number.
"W-Who could this be?" I thought to myself, a bit scared of whoever would be calling me.
Not wanting to face my worries at the moment, I waited for the caller to stop.
But it didn't.
Brushing off all the 'what-ifs' going on my mind, I decided that there wasn't much harm in picking it up. What could possibly happen in just one phone call?
With a trembling thumb, I pressed the button on the screen and answered the call. Placing my phone to my ear, I spoke,
"H-Hello?"
The other end of the line went silent for a while, until I heard a familiar voice.
"(Name)?......It's me."
I dropped my phone.
