"How come you two are from different religions, clearly, the driver is muslim and by the cross on your neck and on the mirror, you and your brother are christians" I can see 'fool' written on Elina's forehead.
"Our parents are pretty much an open-minded people *pause* It was difficult of  course for us when my dear sister changed her religion *sighs* but it's pretty fine now" She smiled nervously again.
"Aaaaah, Yo- Are you distracting me ? I want your license now" He tried to sound tough and angry .
"Did you know that you're handsome ?" Now I see 'Fool and idiot' on Elina's forehead.
"Thank you but, you look too young for me, your sister looks fine" Is he secretly flirting with me ? Astaghferollah ! I've seen this in movies 1000 times, bad cop, good girl breaks speed limits, cop flirts with her and then some bad things happen. I should freak out right now.
"What is going on here Nolan ? What took you so long ?" Another cop came, I'VE SEEN THIS IN MOVIES TOO.
"I Uh *clears throat* I- "
"FOR GOD'S SAKE ! Stop flirting with girls" Yaaaaay A decent cop !
"I was checking her license sir" He looked ashame.
"And why can't I see the license in your hands ?" Not yaaaaay for the decent cop.
"I don't have one" I confessed slowly.
"In that case, you should jump out of the car and come with us" Ya Allah help me.
"You are under arrest"
"WHAT ? WHY" Like I didn't know...
"For stealing this car and kidnapping this girl" What ?
"NO NO she did not kidnap me !" Elina defended me.
"Oh, In that case, you're a part of the crime. Teenagers make 60% of presioners, I wonder why" The decent cop pulled me out of the car.
"Hand cuffs" The decent cop gave the bad cop two cuffs. He put it on Elina, I looked at her widened eyes and noticed that he wasn't touching her hands only, my blood boiled and I walked toward her but she told me to stop. "Can I have a word with you sir ?" Elina spoke to the decent mustachey cop then the cop Nolan came toward me holding hand cuffs and a dirty smile "Oh, you're Mr.Carter's daughter" I heard the good cop gasp, Nolan put my hands behind my back "Too bad" He whispered in my ear then did an improper move. That's it.
I turned around and used my free hand to punch his face "That's for Elina" I punched his face again with more power and anger "And this is for me" The man fell on the ground.
"I'm so sorry, tell your father that I appreciate everything he did for this town an-" The mustachey cop's eyes widened when he saw my standing beside the tall figure of his assistant.
