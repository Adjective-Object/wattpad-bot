Japan raised an eyebrow. "Oh, is that so?"


"What are you talking about, bro?! That's not it at all! Hey, Japan, you are alive, aren't you?" South Korea asked.


Chuckling a bit, Japan replied, "Huhu, yes, I'm alive, thank you. I heard that the enemy is outside, too. How are you fairing with it?"


"It's piece of cake! We're cleaning the way for you, so you better get out of there already!" he told them.


China listened in and shook his head. "Yeah, except we kind of can't right now. We've been in a...dead end for a while..."


"Haha, what are you talking about, bro?! If I'm here, that means everyone is going to get out!" South Korea told them proudly.


China tilted his head. "Why?"

With a proud huff, South Korea beamed, "Because 'escaping with everyone' originated in me! That's why everyone is going to get out! Absolutely!"


"Huhu, I see. Then we will do our best to see if you are right. Won't we, everyone?" Japan asked the others.


Canada smiled. "Yes. Now that we got some time, our heads have also cooled down."


Humming a little, South Korea then spoke, "Oh, Japan, I was looking around the house and wondered, are you in an annexe right now?"


"Annexe?!" England exclaimed in surprise.


Another voice was heard from the other line. It was Austria. "You really didn't notice? Then again, we just realised it ourselves-"


"An annexe...Hey, what does that mean, little master?! If it's true..." Prussia trailed in thought.


Russia adjusted his scarf. "Yep, we need to find a door."


"That house is quite vast. Oops...Excuse me, we must go for now. We have some urgent business to attend to." Austria told them hurriedly.


South Korea then spoke, "Well, then, I'll hang up! ...Bro, Japan!"
