Me and Aria ran back to the house and sat down on the couch.

"Wow and to think i was coming to apologize"I said
"I dont want your apology"
"Good coulse your not geting it"
"Look im sorry you dont know when the right time to shoot a gun is but dont take it out in me"
"What ever.........

"Wheres the gun"I said
"Shit! I must of droped it, ill go get it"
She got up but I grabed her hand.
"Your not going while there are 2 Zs out looking for fresh meat"I said.
"I cant protect you, you dont protect me"
With that she left.
I sat there waiting but she never showed up.
I went looking and looking.
I saw her but where I saw her was not were I was expecting.
