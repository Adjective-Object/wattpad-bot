Dylan.:The only good part about my alarm going off at six o'clock on a Friday is that it plays "In The End" by Black Veil Brides. My ass was immediately up out of bed to get ready for school. I had a horrible dream about my past as a child,waking up in cold sweat, and I wanted to get out of the house.
I considered my morning routine rushed:brushed my teeth, put on a simple outfit for school, brushed my dark-brown short hair into two small ponytails. I checked in on my mom. The doctor said last time she had only two weeks until the AIDS killed her. My father left us two months ago, so it was just me and her.
Making sure she had everything she needed, I grabbed my black backpack and headed out the door.
