"Nice party." I said.
Michael came up behind me. "What's up baby." He said kissing me on my cheek and making me turn around and walk off.
"Really nigga?" I said smirking.
"You mines." Michael said.
"BIHHHHH!!" I heard Gia country ass holler behind me.
"Hey girl. Why the hell you twerking on Quincy dislocated ass?!"
"Girl he fine." She said looking at Michael changing the subject.
"He ight." I lied. Michael fine as hell.
"Mhm. Well bye imma got back to shaking my ass."
I shook my head.
"Michael let's go this party is whack as hell." I said grabbing him then Wanna Be Your Man. Came on. I smirked and turned around to Michael.
"Wanna dance?" He asked.
He guided me in the middle and I slow danced with him. I put my head in his chest, swaying from left to right.
God he smells good. Then I let the music take me.
I wanna be your man. (I wanna be you man.) I must make you understand! (I wanna be your man)I wanna be your man.
Michael looked down at me and he kissed me. I smiled and kissed him back. I wrapped my fingers in his curls.
"I knew you wanted me. Let's go home it's late." He said.
We got into the car and headed home. Although it's was only 12.

"How was the party?" Raheem asked.
"It was chill. Gia was twerking her ass off." I said laughing.
"Watch ya mouth girl." Raheem said.
"Goodnight Raheem." I had giving him a hug.
"Goodnight Michael." I said smirking. I saw Raheem raise his eyebrow and look at Michael. Michael bit his lip. "Goodnight shawty." Raheem squinted at Michael and back at me.
"Watch ya eyes muthafucka." Raheem said nudging Michael.
I got up to my room and changed and went to sleep.
