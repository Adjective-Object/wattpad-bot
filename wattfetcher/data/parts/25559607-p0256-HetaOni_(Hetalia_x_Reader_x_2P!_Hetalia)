Al sighed and crossed his arms. "Well, we already saw that coming, you know."
"I know! But I don't get him! I'm perfectly fine with sending her back home to safety....but I don't want her to....to...." he was on the verge of crying.
I raised an eyebrow and gave a puzzled look, "...I don't understand what you're trying to say. You don't want her to what?"
"To forget."

///Japan's PoV///

She faced me with hopeful eyes. "....I belong here with you guys, right?"
"Yes. Yes, you do." I confirmed her with a smile. It was quite strange for her to bring that up again, but my guess was that she was still anxious about it. I was about to ask her some more things, when my phone suddenly rang.
"Oh, a call from Italy. Maybe the reception has gotten better?" I told (Name) as I pulled out my phone from my pockets and pressed the answer button.
"Yes, Japan speaking." I said as I placed the phone to my ear.
Italy gave a soft gasp. "Oh, that was fast, Japan! Listen, I want you to bring us some food. There's a weird creature on the fourth floor, you see, and we're going to try luring it with food." he explained.
"Huh? I don't really... understand, but all I have to do is bring you some food, right? We're on our way." I told him.
Italy let out a squeal and spoke cheerfully, "Thanks!"
"... You sound really happy." I commented, noticing his change of mood.
Italy paused for a while. "Oh... Well, yeah, I mean, it looks like we're going to get out for real very soon. It's like a dream! I'm so happy, like you wouldn't believe!" he beamed.
My eyes widened at his statement. "Is that so?! That's a surprise. I thought we would be here a lot longer---"
"I was surprised, too. ... It's been such a long, long time..." he whispered nostalgically. "Er, so... we're all going to get out together, aren't we, Japan?" he asked.
"Yes, certainly! Well, now, first I'll bring you the food." I replied, turning towards the crates in the saferoom.
I heard a muffled voice in the background. "Since it's a weird creature, it might eat weird things. Germany was saying that maybe you should bring unusual food." Italy informed me.
"All right. I'll take a quick look in the kitchen. We'll be there immediately." I assured him. I looked at the screen of my phone and pressed the button to end the call.
Placing my phone back in my pocket, I faced (Name)-chan. "Germany said--"
"No need to explain, I know." she told me with a knowing smile.
She walked over to the crates of food supplies, with me following her. I saw her take a blueberry and a scone that England had made earlier. "Is that enough?" I asked her.
"Yeah. This is all we need. Tell the others that it's time for us to go to where Italy and the others are." she replied, getting her bag and placing the two food items in it.
Nodding, I spoke, "Alright."

After making sure everything was prepared and that we were all ready, we headed to the fourth floor where Italy, Germany, Spain and Romano were.
