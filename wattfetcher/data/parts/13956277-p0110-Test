I sneaked out slowly without anybody noticing me, because if they did, they'll start questioning about me and why did I come with Leena, I went to the garden and saw many men sitting on chairs, someone was offering dates and coffee, I saw Karam and sat beside him, "Morning" I said, "If anybody asks, you are my friend, Okay? You're not Leena's friend, you're my friend okay?" He said and I nodded.
Two hours later, a van came and they brought they bodies of Leena's parents, they took the bodies inside to let Leena and the women see them for the last time.
It's hard to say goodbye for those you gave you life.
Few ours later, the men wanted to go to a mosque to pray then to go to the cemetery to bury Leena's parents , I didn't know if I was supposed to go so I stayed, maybe only Muslims were allowed to go to mosques, but I couldn't as because Leena said I was Muslim and they'll definitely figure out that I'm not if I do.
The men came back in two hours, 5 busses came and brought food, it was time for dinner, I saw Karam heading toward me with other men, some of them were around my age, "We need your help to put the food inside " Karam said and I stood up and carried a big hot container and knocked the door and a woman opened it, there was a long table, the woman pointed at it, I put the container or the table then noticed Leena, she was quiet with an opened book in her hands that she was reading, "Hi, how's everything going? Stay strong" I whispered to Leena while pretending to fix the table, "Alhamdulillah, I'm trying to keep myself calm between all those women faking their tears  while they hide hate and envy, none of those 4 hundred women even liked my parents or me" She whispered, "What?" I bent down pretending to fix my shoes,  "I'll tell you everything later" She said then went back to the book between her hands, I think it was Qur'aan,  I saw her many times reading it between classes in school.
