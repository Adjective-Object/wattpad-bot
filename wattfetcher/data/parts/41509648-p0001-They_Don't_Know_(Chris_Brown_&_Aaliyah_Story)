- Kayla POV -
Finally this day could have not come any sooner! I'm so excited to be leaving dusty Brooklyn and finally moving down south to Virginia with my dad. It's crazy because this would be my first time really meeting him and I'm so nervous what if he thinks I'm like my mom?.... Let me not think that ... I mean come on he has to be dying to meet me right? Right?...

We are now coming to a land  brace yourself

My plane finally lands and I'm so eager to grab my things and go! My heart starts beating faster than I expected and I'm so happy I could cry and so I did. As I get off the plane I see a man holding up a sign with my name on it. DAD! I run over to him and jump into his arms... giving him the biggest embrace!


Kayla: Dad! I missed you so much I can't wait to...
Man: Are you fucking crazy get off of me!
Kayla: Excuse me! Dad?
Man: I aint your daddy!

He takes another look at me

Man: I mean I can if you want me too ;)
Kayla: Wait wtf I'm so confused... Why are you holding a sign up with my name
Lance: I'm Lance your daddy sent me to pick you up
Kayla: Oh okay I was about to say ... my daddy a lightskin jawn anyways
Lance: Yeah yeah get your stuff you little brat
Kayla: That's your job peasant

I can tell this is gonna be a long drive with this nigga but Idc as long as I get to see my Dad I'm happy ... I wonder where he lives and why he sent a driver hmmmmmmmmmmmm ?!?
