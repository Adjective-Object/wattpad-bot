Time for the key givers! I'm looking forward to this one. I have my fingers cross that a certain yellow colt will win, because if you know my Oc you would know that my Oc is his sister. Remember to comment your least favorite that way your favorite will hopefully have a better shot at winning. So Let's Get Started!

And the nominees are:
COCO POMMEL
SPITFIRE
CHEESE SANDWICH
SEABREEZE
SILVER SHILL
DISCORD
Good luck to the nominees!
