Mia POV
I didn't have a choice so i agreed to go to that party .
after school i waited for my brother while talking to zoe about what we are going to wear, she told me that i have to be hot because i needed a boyfriend , so we planned to go shopping today cause the party is tomorrow (friday) .
"hey zoe, c'mon mia let's go " said nick
"see ya zoe"
"see ya tonight , bye" and with that zoe went to her boyfriend, he drives to and from school everyday although it's 20 minutes drive, i think that's cute.
"so you're having a party ?" i said sarcastically , i knew he is
"yeah, how'd you know i was gonna tell you tonight"
"oh , i know some people" . he laughed "so am i invited?"
"NO" he glared at me
i was about to get mad when he said "haha JK , the look on your face though, hahaha it's your house silly sure you'll be there"
i hit him playfully.
when we arrived , mom wasn't home so i cooked dinner like always.
right after dinner zoe called me , shit i forgot the shopping . "hey , umm i gotta go now , see ya" i said and headed to the door
"aren't you going to change first , you look like shit" nick yelled
"oh god" i went upstairs and wore high waisted shorts , a crop top and vans . my hair was already in a bun , and i didn't put any make up i usually don't put any , i don't like it.
i said bye to nick and called zoe , she said she's coming with ethan, he was gonna drive us to the mall.
