They'll probably hate me.
They'll probably get mad.
But...this is for my parents. It's not like I can just let Luciano or the other 2Ps hurt them.
Those Second Players will stay true to their word, right?
I mean...when I met them, they weren't that bad...
...Okay...maybe they are "bad"...
But I think they know their limits.
I mean, if they didn't they would've probably killed me by now. But instead...they promised not to harm me in any way, well, given that I follow what they say...
Staying true to their word...that means...they can hold their principles, right?
That means...it's...not too late for them to change, right?
Right?
Seriously...they can...change if they were talked to properly...
I mean...look at Ollie, for example.
Then it hit me.
"Ollie..." I gasped.
Japan turned around to face me, "Hmm? Did you say something just now, (Name)-chan?"
I shook my head and spoke, "N-No, it's nothing..." After that, the Japanese man proceeded walking.
Oliver Kirkland...my...friend...
That's right...Ollie's the reason why I got out of the room...he...helped me.
He may be a Second Player like Luciano and the others...but he chose to help me, instead.
Because...they may be Second Players...but they have hearts, too.
The question there is...
...is it too late to change all of them?

((ALLEN'S PoV! Yeah, that's right, dollface.))
As the rest of us were heading back to our base on the fifth floor, I kept thrashing everything I came across upon.
"Fucking First Player!! I knew I should've just killed him when he was on his way upstairs--but nooo! We just had to plan it out like, what the hell?! Aren't those damned plans made so that we won't screw shit up?!" I yelled, swinging my bat across the halls and breaking vases.
Francois gave me an annoyed glance. "We get you, but don't cause too much noise. What if they hear us?"
"Mhhm, they probably won't though. Those guys are somewhere on the second floor that we can't get access to." Mattheiu stated.
SMASH!
I destroyed some more  vases as we walked down the corridor.
"What the hell is that bastard's problem?" I heard Nikolai say, but I was too busy smashing vases to get pissed off by him calling me a bastard.
"He's throwing a fit because that so-called weakling of the First Players killed his little pet alien. He's being such a wuss about it." Mattheiu answered. I turned around when I heard what he sad and dashed over to him.
"For the last time, he's not my fucking pet. He's my buddy. Hell, he could probably be a nicer brother than you're being right now you asshole." I shouted at his face, grabbing him by the collar of his flannel shirt.
