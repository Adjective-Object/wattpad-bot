I was sixteen when it first happened. Scott and stiles had left to find a dead body in the woods but, I had declined saying I had homework and needed to pick an outfit for the first day back at school. That was my first mistake. It's not like I lied, I really did have homework and I needed to pick out an outfit but I just withheld some information that the boys should probably know, especially with scott being my twin and all. That was my second mistake. Scott I shouldn't have let him go that night, I knew something was going to happen but I just couldn't place my finger on what. I had just finished doing what I needed to do when I felt a pain in my side and then I blacked out. I woke up the same night on the floor of the woods in front of a burned house. The hale house. I heard voices coming from within, they were screaming, calling out for help and so I entered. My final mistake that night. The house was empty but as soon as my foot hit the floor of the house I knew everything that had happened there, I knew about the fire and the werewolves. I even knew who set the fire. Kate Argent. I could see the people that had once lived there and put names to faces Cora, Peter, Derek,Laura, Talia and others. That was the night I realised what I was. What I am. I am Olivia Mccall and I am a Banshee.
So hi guys.... here it is the first chapter of banshee hopefully this goes well.
