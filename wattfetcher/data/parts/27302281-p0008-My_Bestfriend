I smile to myself
" what are we watching " she said  kissing my cheek and  sitting on the couch and handing me a drink
" frozen" I said pulling her close to me and she laid her head on my chest and I kissed her forehead
" yay I love this movie " she said smiling wide
(an hour in)
I looked over and noticed Kylies  breathing slowed down and then I noticed her sleeping and smiled and tucked a strand of hair behide her ear and turned off the TV and laid her down  on my chest and  fell asleep   along with her.
