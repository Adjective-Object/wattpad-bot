"i can't drown my demons, they know how to swim"

dearest noel,
i'm so tired and hungry. my body aches. i'm so cold. my eyes are dead. dark.
my fingers tremble. my head hurts.
my stomach hurts. but it's okay, noel.
you know why?
because it's applauding noel. it's applauding.
i'm not hungry.
i need to be beautiful noel.
i know i'm killing myself but i can't stop.
i can't fight my demons on my own noel. they're stronger than i ever was. but noel, when you came into my life that changed.
you helped me fight those demons. every time it felt like they were going to consume me. you were right beside me. you never left my side. you hugged me so tightly, wiped away my tears, held my hands.
you were always there.
you never left.
but now....you're just...gone.
how? how am i supposed to do it on my own noel?
i hate myself more and more every passing second.
i will always live with the guilt that i couldnt save you from yourself.
i can hear mommy crying.
i'm such a failure noel. i failed you. i failed my mom. i failed myself. i couldn't even eat for mommy, noel. i couldn't even make her happy for even a second. i just couldn't do it. the voices and my demons are winning noel.
and you know what?
i don't even care anymore.
