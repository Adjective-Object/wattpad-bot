Many people think they have the worst life, they don't get what they want, and their parents treat them like trash. HAH, nonsense, I have to wake up at 5am everyday for training and go to sleep at 12am. The whole day we train, and barely get fed, if we make one mistake they will beat us. So why do I stay? Well over them threatening to kill us if we leave, it's the only thing I know, I've grew up here, and I'm loyal to them I'm one of their best fighters. There's about two million over girls and boys here, it's like a huge factory, they make us fighters. They make us want to hate America. Since I was a girl they trained me harder, we believe that girls are more capable of being great then boys, yeah no offense. I have chestnut brown hair with gold highlights that always shine bright in the sun. I am 12 and small for my age which is ok, I have very tan skin with hazel eyes, I look Italian which throughs everyone off, and I am the best fighter in the whole factory.
"BZZZZ" my eyes slowly crack open, the lights were turning on one by one, the people sleeping besides me begin to stir. Since we sleep standing up I take a step forward, apparently are boss who's name is terra but she considers to have us call her "mom" decides that since there's not a lot of space for us to lay down because of how many of us are here, she has us sleep standing up, this is a reason why we sleep so close together so that we will save space. All of us grew up like this, are real parents either killed are we got taken away from them and brought here. My parents though worked for terra and the Russian army, they went on a mission to American to receive something called the device which will allow us to take control of all American technology including weapons, but they have failed doing so, the American army found out and sentenced them to death. Now it's my turn to finish what my parents started. It's my turn to end the American race.
