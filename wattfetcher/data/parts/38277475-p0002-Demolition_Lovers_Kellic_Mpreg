"That answers your question. You can not manage that much food."
"What made you eat all that stuff anyways" Tony asked.
"I was hungry"
"Yeah I know but when ever you're hungry you usually eat healthy. Not bags of chips and chocolate"
"I don't know I was just craving it so I ate it" I replied with a shrug.
Mike looked at Tony.
"Whens the last time you and Vic had sex" he asked.
"Why would you want to know that. That is just gross"
"Answer the question" he said.
"Umm three weeks ago. What does this have to do with anything"
"We just want to know just in case..."
I started laughing. "Just in case what. I'm pregnant"
They nodded there heads.
"That is not possible. Guys can't get pregnant and last time I checked I have a dick"
"Kellin it's just.... we're just trying to see whats wrong" Mike said.
"Nothing is wrong"
The front door opened and I heard Tonys moms voice.
"Ma can you come here" Tony asked.
"Tony don't you dare ask her" I warned him.
"What are pregnancy symptoms" he asked.
"Why do you want to know" she asked.
"Just tell us"
"Well sickness, headaches, cravings, mood swings... Why?"
"Well Kellin.."
"Don't say it" I said.
"We think Kellin may be pregnant" Mike said.
"Ugg you had to fucking say it" I yelled.
Tonys mom looked at me and then down to my stomach.
"May I" she asked motioning towards it.
"May you what. Touch my stomach I don't see how that will tell you anything"
"Kellin shes a doctor she knows these things and shes been trained to do this" Tony said.
"Fine do what ever you want but I am not pregnant. N-O-T." I said.
She placed her hand on my stomach and then gasped.
"What? What is it?" I asked scared now.
She shook her head.
"There's a baby in there"
