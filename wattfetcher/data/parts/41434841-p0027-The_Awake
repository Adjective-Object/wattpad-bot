I can't figure out what's better. Pills. Cuts. Drowning. Hanging. Jumping. A bullet to the head.
Pills are simple. Sometimes.
Cuts. You'll hurt. Probably pass out from the pain before you die.
Drowning. The feeling of water rushing in through your nose and mouth is like fire. Your lungs can't take it. They just. Pop. It's a possibility.
Hanging. Well. I'd have to measure myself the get the appropriate amount of rope. Or else I'd just have whiplash.
Jumping. Scary. Adrenaline. Enjoyment. And then pain. If you don't die you're probably paralyzed.
A bullet to the head. If my aim is off I couldBe severely injured and then I would be found. I have one shot at this one. Literally. I couldn't do it even if I wanted to. We have guns but there's too much of a gap.
Pills seems like a safe bet.
Sleeping pills.
I'd vomit and then pass out. It'd ruin my throat.
Oh well.
Pills it is.
I better get looking for some.
