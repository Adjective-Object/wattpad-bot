A good thing was that barely any of the fans were paying attention to anything else besides getting their merch. The ones who did waved at me and I would wave back at them. I didn't dare take any pictures or do anything else besides sit there and help every so often, but mostly I stayed out of their way. It was really cool to watch though but I wasn't really  paying attention to any of the other merch employees just their manager. Kellin was amazing.
He was cute when he dealt with people. He was sweet to them and got them everything they wanted. Finally the place started to clear out and pretty much all of them fell into seats sighing in relief that they were all gone.
"Well that was stressful." I said sitting next to Kellin. He smiled and took a drink from his water.
"You have no idea."
"Do you guys need help cleaning up or anything?"
He shook his head, "No I think we've got it."
"Okay, well I'll see you on the bus then?"
He nodded, "Yeah I'll see you later."
I smiled at him before getting up and walking away from the merch guys. I made my way back to the buses quickly waving to any fans that we still hanging around.
"Hey guys." I said walking onto the bus.
"Hey." Mike said and threw a piece of popcorn at me.
"What were you doing?" Tony asked grabbing a handful of the popcorn from Mike.
"Hanging at merch."
"Hanging with Kellin you mean." Jaime said wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.
I rolled my eyes, "We were hanging out yeah. So what."
"Was that all you were doing?"
"I was helping him with merch and stuff like that."
"They are so into each other." Mike said laughing.
"No we're not."
"Yes you are, admit it Vic you know you want him."
"No. There is nothing there. I don't like him."
"Sure you don't." Jaime scoffed.
"But Jaime what about the Fuenciado shippers out there. It would break their little hearts."
He gagged, "Gross. That's just- ew!" He said looking absolutely disgusted.
I laughed, "I know. I can't believe people ship us."
"It's so gross."
"Right."
"But Kellic on the other hand, when all the fans find out about that ship it's going to be great."
"No, no shipping."
"Yes, yes shipping. It's the otp." Jaime said and the other two nodded in agreement.
I groaned, "Stop talk-"
"Hey guys." We all stopped and saw Kellin walk in.
"Hey Kells." Tony said smiling at him.
"Hey."
Kellin smiled at all of us and took a seat next to me causing Mike to smirk at us. I glared at Mike.
