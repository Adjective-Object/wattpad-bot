Riley's P.O.V
I'm so nervous to see Lucas. We are in senior year of high school now not much should have changed. I hope. Maya!!
"Hey Maya!" I say
"Hey Riles." She says
"Ladies!"
"Farkle!"
I don't think I've ever been this happy to see Farkle. Eh probably have. It's so nice to have our little circle together again. Though where is Lucas. Then, I see someone walking down the hall.
"Is that Lucas?"
"I think that is Ranger Rick." Maya says
"Hey guys i feel like I haven't seen you in forever." He says
Something is weird going on here. I just can't put my finger on it yet. He looks so nervous.
"Riles!" Maya says snapping me out my thoughts.
"Huh?"
"He asked  how you have been."
"O sorry I'm good and you."
That was close. Like really close. But, it's nice to see him again.I wonder if he has a girlfriend yet.Why would I care.Ha Ha H.I miss him I really do.I wonder if he misses me?Ugh he's making me think and become self conscious. I hate that. I just want to be happy and fun-loving.I'll just talk to him.
"Hey Lucas."
"O hey Riley. You've grown up nicely even though I saw u the whole summer."He says while staring into my eyes.
"I've missed you more than usual."I blurt out.
I'm not sure how he'll response.But, I love the way he does.He kisses me!!! I'm so happy.
"Wait does this mean i'm your girlfriend." I ask
"I would like that." He answers.
"Me too."
Then, he pulls me by the waist and kisses me. YAYYYY!! I have a boyfriend. Do the happy dance.Then, we walk to class hand in hand.Then, I wonder where Maya and Farkle went. We'll see them later we always do.
