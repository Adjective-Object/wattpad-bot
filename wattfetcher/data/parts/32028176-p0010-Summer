"Well okay.." Dad says in a more confused way and walks away not knowing what else to say.
"You suck at lies," Archie says while walking to the fridge.
"No, I- Yeah I do"
"Don't you have school tomorrow?"
"Oh, crap that's right," I say before I quickly go inside my room while Archie follows.
"Here," I say while handing Archie a few pillows and a blanket. "Go sleep on the couch."
"Well what a lovely soft bed I'll be sleeping in tonight," he sarcastically says.
"Goodnight Archie," I say pushing him out the door.
"Night Boo," I hear him say in a sassy tone.
Oh, what an interesting life I have.
As I fall asleep I begin to feel a deep pounding in my chest and my breathing grows heavy, I hear a vague screaming of my own name, by Archie and --my mother--. My breath rapidly increases and I could feel their voices draw sharp blades into my ears, they were still the same people I loved, but the voices were distorted and distant. At this I gasped I saw them briefly but then a high pitched beep lulled me away with it's numb regular pattern. It was mocking my life, with seemed anything but dull, rhythmic, and especially regular. "Why is this happening to me?" I thought --the voice within me screaming in agony-- but before I was able to answer my own question, I finally fell into a deep sleep.
