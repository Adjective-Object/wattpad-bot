I: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! HAPPY UNBRITHDAY! IT'S YOUR UNBIRTHDAY TODAY!!!
A: Ian, i'm not in the mood.
I: what's wrong?
A: what's wrong is i'm old as fuck.
I: Ant, being 63 doesn't mean that you're old as fuck. you're only as old as you feel.
A: well, in that case i must be dead.
I: Ant, don't be like this.
A: I'm going to die soon, i know it.
I: the average live span is 87 years old, Ant.
A: some people don't live that long, Ian.
I: I feel like you will <3
A: our 'forever' is slowly catching up to us, Ian. our 'forever' is ending...
I: Anthony, there is no such thing as forever, but our forever is not ending or catching up to us. we vowed to stay together till death do us part, and damnit i'm going to stick with that promise!
A: i love you so much <3
I: i love you too <3
