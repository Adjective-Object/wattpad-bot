My parents always told me not to talk to strangers on the Internet. Of course I never lisen. When random people talked to me on Kik I would always reply. I stoped doing that though.
On April 17, 2015 I was at my friends house doing a stupid project that we didn't even have to do. It wasn't even a grade. When someone followed me on Instagram. I mean I'm used to it. When the person started spamming me and liked all of my photos. I didn't expect her to do that but I went to her profile and I liked all of her pictures in return.Soon she Dmed me.She told me I didn't have to do that.What I didn't know is we would become the bestest friends._________________________________________________
