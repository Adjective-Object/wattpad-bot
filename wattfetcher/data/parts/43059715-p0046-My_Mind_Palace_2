The news is on they put lights on the White House to make it rainbow and my dad goes
"This is a disgrace to America. What that building means, what it represents, and to do that.. He's going to go down as one of our worst presidents."
And I'm flupping pissed off
He's giving us a speech
"America has gone back hundreds of years and the meaning of marriage is a man and a woman together. And he just changed that because a few sickos wanted it to happen."
