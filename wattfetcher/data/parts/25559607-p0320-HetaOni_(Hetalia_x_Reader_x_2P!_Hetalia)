Well... A little birdie told me that it seems like you're becoming quite troubled about this whole...predicament.... Is it true?

What?! How...how does he know?! Don't tell me....that there's a 2P hiding inside the saferoom or something! ...No...I don't think that's the case...but then....


Taking a deep breath, I texted him back:

Second...
...Yeah, this whole thing is...starting to make me crazy.

Now...how about I tell you something that could lift your spirits?

I raised an eyebrow as I finished reading his reply. I am both suspicious...and somehow eager to find out what he was going to tell me.
