Hey guys.I just wanted to say that I read through my chapters before and found a huge problem that I really want to get over with.I realized that I couldn't really convey the feelings into words, it all just didn't sound right and it ugh and I didn't expect it to be that bad. So I decided to stop the story for a little until I am done editing all the chapters and then I will continue with the other chapters.I am sorry for the inconvenience, but it won't be necessary to re-read the chapters, however I would appreciate it if you do.Have a nice day everyone.
