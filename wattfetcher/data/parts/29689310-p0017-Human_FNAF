Chica POV
I remembered that we had some 3 month spoiled milk in the fridge since I've been kinda lazy recently. So I slipped it out and tried not to gag at the smell. I got a box of fruity pebbles off the top of the fridge and poured some into a bowl. Then I put the milk in and sprayed the room with Febreeze so the milk smell wouldn't be as noticeable. I hope to God this gets back at her, or else I'm screwed. I wrote a note that said "Sick in bed today but I made breakfast for you, Angelina. Hope we can make up! ☻" and left it in front of the bowl. I snickered at it, but then went back to my room, ignoring the pain in my nose. I went back to bed, waiting for Angelina's scream to wake me up.
Gold POV
I woke up to Angelina's beautiful face in front of mine. I smiled and shook her shoulders. "Wake up sleeping beaut-" "IM AWAKE" she shouted in the middle my sentence. I put my hands up in surrender and stood up. I noticed a bowl on the counter. "What's that?" I asked, and Angelina got curious. She got up and went to the counter.
THIRD PERSON POV
"Chica made me breakfast." Angelina said bitterly, sitting down and crumpling the note up in her hand. She took a spoonful and before smelling it, or even looking at it, she stuck it in her mouth. It didn't take long for her to spit it out onto her silk pajamas and scream, running to the bathroom to wash out her mouth. In her room, Chica smirked at the scream, pretending to be asleep while Freddy stirred. "What was that?" Freddy asked when he fully woke up. "I don't know. Freddy? I have something to tell you." "Yeah babe?" He turned over and kissed her nose. "I have something to explain to you. Amelia locked me in my bathroom and that's why I was gone. She also broke my nose in the process." He shot straight up and stared at her. "Chica! Why didn't you tell me?" She was almost in tears. "I'm sorry," she said, sniffling. "I didn't think anyone would believe me or understand. I'm gonna stay home from work today. I'll call in sick." He kissed her cheek and stood up, getting ready for his own job. She grabbed her phone and called the school she worked at, which was also the school Bonnie worked at. "Hello? Mr.Benton? I'm not going to be at work today. I'm feeling really sick and I don't think I can pull it out. So if you could contact-" that second, Angelina burst into the room. "ME!" She sang. "Mr.Benton, contact the best music teacher in the district, Miss Fane. At 572-6816. Thank you!" She ended the call for Chica and she started daggers at Angelina. "I...will..kill...you!!!!" She lunged at Angelina and half-strangled her. She pushed her out of the door and shoved her down. "Why, isn't this a stupid reason to kill someone?" Angelina fake smiled at her. "Locking someone in a room and breaking their nose? I think not." Just then, Gold walked into the room. "LADIES!" Break it up!" He pulled Chica off of Angelina and held Angelina back. "Thank you, sweetheart. You're going to help me now, right?" He laughed at her and held her shoulder. "You think I would? We're done. Find a different way home." He slapped her and pushed her out of the door. Then he slammed it. Chica was breathing heavily. "I'm so f*cking glad that's over." Gold laughed. "And I'm glad she's out of my life."
