I hissed, placing a hand on my hip. Adam ignored me and turned to you. "I'm going on ahead, I'll just meet up with you during lunch hours."
He walked down the two steps, purposely bumping into my shoulder. I narrowed my eyes, cracking my knuckles one on one even when Adam's figure disappeared. I calmed down, feeling your hand touching my own hand. "Wait, do you two work close together?" I asked you.
You nodded, readjusting your red tie. "His building is just around the corner if you walk a quarter mile forward the sidewalk." You mentioned. "He and I usually meet at the park halfway so we won't be late when lunch break is over."
I nodded, understanding. We stood by each other in comfortable silence, but you broke after only half a minute. "You know, the assistant job is still free." He quipped. I hummed, placing a finger on my lips.
Thinking about it, I did decide to have a free day today. "Okay." I replied with a grin. "Wala naman ako ni gumagawa ngayon."
