"Have you ever had a nightmare that made you wanna cry? Have you realized and ever asked yourself 'Why did it make me cry?' That's when all this time you've wanted to die."
I wake up and cry,I wake up and I realize I'm still alive,I wake up and remember why'd I told that lie!
I wake up and realize how much pain that I had done, I wake up and cry!
I wake up and cry! I wake up and seemed to lost all my friends. I wake up and remember my dreams are burning inside of me.
I wake up and forgot what I've written about. I wake up see that flame I call a flash back once again.I wake up and cry!
