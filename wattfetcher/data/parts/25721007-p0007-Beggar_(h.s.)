"Why the hell are you sleeping in my bed?" Harry immediately jumped up.  He was still in just his boxers.
"First of all, you don't even live here," I defended myself.
"You don't either, you're just a random bum from the streets that my idiot friends decided to have you sleep here," he argued back. Harsh.
I took in Harry's features for a moment. He had brown, curly hair. Emerald green orbs. A lip piercing and an eye brow piercing. And on his arms and chest were covered in black ink.
He seems so familiar. Then it clicked. He was the person who saved me.
"Wait a second, you were the guy who saved me from Brock last week,"
"No," he said nonchalantly.
"Yes, you were. I remember now,"
"So? Why does it matter if I did?"
"Because you care about me," I smirked.
"I would've done that for any girl who was getting pinned to the wall and screaming," He shrugged. I don't know why, but something inside me made me feel hurt.
It stayed silent for a minute. Until I asked, "Why do you hate me so much?"
"I never said I did," he frowned. For a moment I thought he was being nice.
"Then why do you say those things?" I pushed further trying to find an answer.
"I don't know. Why are you so nosy Lennon?" He inched closer to me. This is the first time that he actually called me by my real name not bum or homeless.
"Because I wanna know who you really are, Harry," I spoke the truth. He's confusing. I felt him inch closer to me again. Until I was pinned against the wall. Our lips were almost touching.
"You're so beautiful," he whispered. He just gave me a compliment. Is that even possible for him?
Our lips collided and something within me sparked. I know I shouldn't be kissing the guy who makes fun of me, but I can't help it. This is my first kiss and I can't stop even if I tried. Harry's hands moved down to my hips and I wrapped my legs around him.
"Harry, we are going ou" Niall spoke behind us, "Oh."
He pushed himself off me and we both looked at Niall, who was smiling like crazy.
"Well, the boys are going out for breakfast," he said.
"I'll go," Harry darted out the bedroom door not even acknowledging me.
"I'm gonna stay. If that's all right," I gave him a sympathetic smile.
"Alright," he smirked, "I know you already had breakfast anyway."
"Shut up," I playfully said and threw a pillow at him.

I spent the rest of the morning thinking about the events that happened earlier. I'm so confused. Harry is like a Christmas present. You can't wait to unwrap it and see what's inside, yet the paper around it is holding you back. That's exactly how he is.
I want to get to know the real Harry. Not the rude, judge mental one. Sometimes I feel it's all an act just to hide something he doesn't want to admit. And I wish I knew what it was.
The confusing part is that he kissed me. And he told me that I'm 'so beautiful'. His lips. They were so soft and the way they felt on mine was a feeling on its own. He was so gentle. It's like he actually liked me in that moment. I almost liked him too.
