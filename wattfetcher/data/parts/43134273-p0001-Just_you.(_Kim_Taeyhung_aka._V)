"I miss you so much girly. How are you? No wait I want to to know how's school been. Wait....ha-ha your school doesn't start for  until tomorrow right?  Well lets go bac....."  "Jen" you interrupted "Do you have any idea what time it is here?""Is it like 10 in the morning" Jen guessed"God Jen its only 2 in morning and I have school tomorrow. How we just email each other." (y/n) said"Oh Okay, don't forget bye. Or should I say annyeog"
That was weird (y/n) thought. Last time you'd remembered Jen new absolutely no korean and you known her forever.
7 hours later
Oh no you thought todays the day. New school, new people and you happened to be the new girl.  What's next you thought to your self as you walk outside the door.  Before you knew what happened seven wild and crazy boys bumped into you making everything fall out the bag you once had in your hands.
Great (y/n) thought "can this day get any better" (y/n) murmured."Absolutely, the day just started"  you heard someone say with a deep voice.
" Well I don't know. As far as I know my day have been getting worse and not getting better. I loved to stay and chat but today is my first day of school and I rather not be late."  (y/n) said to the boy who stopped
❄         ❄          ❄
"First day of school eh. I always loved the first day of school." The lady at the desk said
This is it. I hope this lady hands me my schedule before the bell rings.  I would hate to walk into the class after everyone is quite. I hate how everyone will be staring. (y/n) thought
"Here you go, looks like your first class is in room 120." The office lady said just as the bell rang.
"Thanks" you couldn't help being a little mad at the lady. She was wasting your time and now there no way to avoid people looking at you once you enter the classroom.
❄        ❄         ❄
Entering the room wasn't as bad as you thought most of the people were working on the work the teacher had given them just before you came in.
"Annyeonghaesyo,you must be (y/n)." The teacher said "I'm Mrs. Ku, please introduce yourself to class."
Just then (y/n) felt a blush creeping up on your cheeks. "Annyeonghaesyo, my name is (y/n)." (Y/n) said bravely
"You will be sitting by Taehyung." Mrs.Ku spoke
With your head down making sure you made no eye contact with anyone you walked to your seat.  Sitting down you felt someone staring.  Looking up from the desk you glance around to see if anyone was watching. To your surprise no one was looking. Maybe I'm just going crazy. (Y/n) thought to herself.
"Hey" you heard someone say "looks like you found yourself safe at school."
Turning to look at the boy sitting next to you. For some reason this boy looked familiar. Why was he talking to me you thought. No boy would ever look at me. Matter of fact no boy has ever talked to me.
" ha-ha sorry I'm Taehyung but my friends call me V."  He puts out he's hand for you to shake.  Taking he's hand you realized why he looked familiar.
"Thanks for running into me earlier. You could have helped me pick up my things you know." The words came out before you had a chance to realize how rude it sounded. Being rude wasnt in your blood or so you thought.
"Yeah about that....I was with my friends I didn't mean to be disrespectful or anything. I'm truly sorry." Taehyung said while scratching his head.  "You know what how about I make it up to you."
