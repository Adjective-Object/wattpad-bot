On Aura High, they met alot of people. Darryl Smiths, and Rennee Joshua Fieddingfield are the most known of those. Knowing that, Darryl has a huge crush on Zack. And Rennee on the other hand, is a component of Michelle.
Meaning, Rennee likes Dallin. Too. She reached 16, and a sophomore at Aura Vista High. She became famous. Not because of she is 'The School Chic' 's  Bestfriend. She is 'The Fashionable Geek' of the school and 'The Top-Notch' of the year. As always.
Zakura is always proud of her. Always. And Michelle, is always thankful, because she met a perfect person. A Beautiful and a Perfect Soul just have met. But what could happen if they met their forevers? Will the strong relationship with each souls stay stronger as they encounter harder life struggles?
