You know that moment when you're so happy that you don't know what to do with yourself, but smile like a fool? That's how I felt when Luke sang to me. He would serenade me, and I'd smile at the floor like an idiot; every single time. I'd forget to breathe because the only thing I was paying attention to was him. When he sang, I'd get lost in my own little world, losing all awareness to my surroundings.
"All I want is the taste that your lips allow," he and Calum sang in front of the tiny, little web camera. I sat in the corner of the room, behind the computer, listening to how they harmonized their voices with such ease. Luke strummed the guitar, aggressively, making his Bob Marley T-Shirt sway back and forth between the back of the guitar and his chest.
His eyes caught mine as the lyrics left his mouth, the words hanging in the air. He stole glances to look at me in between chord changes, which made me smile at the carpet, stupidly. I looked up to find his head down, watching his fingers against the strings. His attention would go from the guitar to Cal to me then back to his guitar.
I watched the two sing my favorite song that made me sway everytime I heard it. I watched how his head moved with the note he sang, causing his hair to flop in the adorable way it did. The feeling filled my entire body, sending me to a whole new universe. I lost myself, as always, the tune filling the air while their strong voices bounced off the walls.
"Give me love," Luke's voice rang, escaping the trance he was under.
Calum hummed before standing up as Luke messed around with the guitar on his lap. My eyes followed Cal turn off the camera, bringing me down from Cloud 9, the realization what I had yet to tell him, setting in.

"You've been awfully quiet," Luke pointed out. We sat in my room, watching some movie I didn't know. I stayed mute, afraid to say what I needed to. "What's up?"
"Is it possible to change everything in the span of a couple seconds?" I asked. He looked at me, furrowing his eyebrows before answering with a simple 'yes.'
"Why are you asking this?" He questioned, looking down at me. We leaned on the back of bed frame, his arm draped around me like a cloak.
"You know my cover of Skyscraper?" I interrogated. He nodded. "Well, Demi actually saw it and DM'd me, so we met up about a week ago in LA, which was why I was gone for a couple of days. Anyway, she showed her record label the video, and long story short, they loved it and want to sign me."
He remained silent, slowly processing the news. His face gave off nothing, leaving me to guess how he felt about the whole situation. This wasn't even the worse part.
"That's amazing," he laughed. "Why didn't you tell me?"
"I didn't know where it was going to go, so I felt like I should just keep quiet until I knew it was something important," I sighed, giving him a small smile. He pulled me in closer, kissing my forehead. His smile grew against my skin, making this moment even harder.
"Yeah because Demi Lovato isn't important," he said, sarcastically. I laughed, shakily, scared to finish the news.
"So, uh, the studio's in LA," I said, trying to avoid his eyes. I could feel him staring at me in utter disbelief. "I leave tomorrow afternoon. I'm going to stay with Courtney."
"Oh, um, okay. We can make this work. When do you get back?" He asked, attempting to find a solution for us.
"I don't," I said, the tears welling up in my eyes. "I'm moving there. This is such an amazing oppurtunity, I can't not accept something like this."
