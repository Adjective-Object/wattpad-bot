"Okay, have fun. Don't be stupid."
"We have a concert in three hours, I'm not that stupid!" I said rolling my eyes.
"You never know."
"I'm probably just going to go get something to eat then come back." I told them annoyed.
"Don't get snippy."
"I'm not being snippy." I said and left the bus and them. I don't know where I'm going I just need to get away from everyone for just a few hours.
Austin's POV
"Alan." I said stopping him from leaving the venue.
"Yeah?" He asked.
"How about in an hour you and I go on a date."
He smiled, "Really?"
"Yeah, I think it'll be good. Well get back before Pierce's set so you can do what you got to."
"Sounds fun." He said and gave me a quick kiss, "I've gotta save a couple of pictures to my computer and get ready so I'll see you in an hour." He said excitedly.
"See you in an hour."
He smiled and waved before running off to the buses.
He is so cute.
"Aust, you and I have an interview in like half hour." Tino said walking over, "Don't forget."
I groaned, "Dammit."
"You forgot about it didn't you?" He asked crossing his arms.
"No, I know." I said, "I know about it."
"Alright, well I'll see you then." He told me.
"Yeah, see you." I said and he walked off to the bus.  Now felt like an ass. I couldn't take Alan out.  It's going to crush him when I tell him especially when he looked so excited.
I sighed and left the venue and back to the bus and to the bunk area where Alan was doing stuff on his computer, "Hey babe."
"Hey Aust, check out this picture I got of Vic punching Johnny." He said looking up from his computer.
"Oh wow. That's great." I said, "Hey, look, I can't take you out tonight."
Alan frowned, "What do you mean you can't take me out? Yo-you just said like ten minutes ago that we are."
"I have an interview and I totally forgot about it. I'm sorry."
"Oh," He said his shoulders slumping. "It's fine. We can just do it another time."
"I'm really sorry." I told him, "I want to take you out."
"It's okay babe, we can do it again some other time." He said smiling a little, "Besides I had some school work to do anyways."
"For sure. I don't want to mess this up."
"It's fine Aust. Go get ready for your interview."
I sighed, "I'm still really sorry."
He sighed, "Austin! It's fine chill out!" He yelled.
"Okay, okay."
"Good," He said and looked back at his computer. "Now you go get ready so you look hot for your interview and I'm going to catch up on some assignments."
"Can I get a kiss first?"
He sighed dramatically, "I guess."
