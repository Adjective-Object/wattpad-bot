Hello, and thanks for choosing this book to read and waste you time on. Simply put, I'm Lucy and I share this account with my best friend Katlynn. This is a rant book, meaning we'll be ranting about certain things that plague our society and our Tumblr walls.
The first few chapters will be of you getting to know us, until the real ranting begins to happen. We'll cover things from fandom ships to funny fashion trends. All I ask, if that you don't judge the somewhat crazy, angry, or stupid rants we publish within this book.
But hey, if you agree not to judge, we won't judge your crazy comments either. So, put on your fangirl armour that protects you against all kinds of feels, and come join us as we rant.

- Lucy & Katlynn.
