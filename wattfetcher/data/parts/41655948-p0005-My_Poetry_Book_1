I was drowning in anxiety
When you saved me.
And although I've been
Told to guard my heart,
The feelings accumulate.
That scares me, honestly.
Knowing that I can keep
It up, and give you everything
I have and in two seconds,
You can take it all back,
Erase whatever it is that
We now have.
But I don't know how
To stop. I still feel dead
Inside but you can still
Manage to get inside my
Head and set fire to regret.
