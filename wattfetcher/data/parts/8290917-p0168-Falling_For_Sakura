Before she knew anything, Tristan got her by the other arm and chuckled. "You're dancing with me, sweetheart."
"Oi!" Conrad snapped. "I got the first dance. Isn't that right, Sakura?"
She managed to give him a small smile, though her head was spinning. "How about we all dance together?" she suggested weakly.
"Yeah, why not?" Logan said, appearing out of the blue and pulling her into his arms. He whisked her away to the other side of the dance floor. Then he twisted her around until she was even dizzier. "Dance, Sakura, dance." He chuckled. Then Conrad appeared before them again and took her into his arms. "Now you're dancing with me."
She needed to get out of here. By that time, however, the music ended and she quickly escaped. She ran across the corridor, down the stairs, and into the back courtyard of the hotel. Alone, she breathed in the fresh air and closed her eyes. Oh, God, that was intense.
Then her mind traveled back to the brothers. What must she do?
She walked farther toward the swimming pool, deep in thought. It wasn't long when she noticed a couple on the other side. They were obviously making out, and she decided she didn't want to disturb them.
She turned and took two steps when she heard, "Darcy, darling."
A knot formed in the pit of her stomach. She stopped in her spot and slowly turned. Across from her, she witnessed Darcy lifting his head from the woman's face. Then she realized the woman was Kate Anderson.
Kate was smiling, and before Darcy had the chance to walk away, she wrapped her arm around his neck and kissed him again.
Sakura's whole body shuddered. Her head still spinning and her heart still thundering within her chest, she walked away.
She had made her decision. Yes, no matter what happened from now on, she had made her decision and she wasn't going to change it.
