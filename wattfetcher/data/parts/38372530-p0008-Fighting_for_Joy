Devin's POV
"Excuse me sir. Sir?" Someone said shaking me.
I immediately rose up out of my seat. "yes sorry." I said.
She smiled. "No need to be sorry. My name is Doctor Maris and I came to inform you that we were in fact able to revive your baby." She said.
"The baby was dead?" I asked and she nodded sadly.
"Yes unfortunately. The baby is premature and suffered from something called meconium aspiration. That's basically when a black tart substance from the babies intestines. It was present in the amniotic fluid and the baby inhaled it causing breathing problems. This is usually found in over due babies so with this baby it wasn't something we were expecting. The baby is now in NICU. Would you like to see your baby?" She asked.
I nodded. "Yes. Yes please." I said and stood up.
I grabbed Cara's hand after waking her and we went to the nursery part of the hospital. After washing our hands and putting on the necessary garments we needed to put on
"Baby Thomas." The sign read in front of the babies incubator and I couldn't help but smile. My baby, it's here.
"You can go ahead and look if you'd like." Doctor Maris said.
I shook my head. "I'm gonna wait." I said.
"Daddy. I want to see." Cara said and I nodded.
"Go ahead. Don't tell me if its a boy or a girl though okay?" I asked her and she nodded going by the incubator to see him or her.
"Sir?" The doctor asked.
I turned around and looked at her. "Yes?" I asked.
"Why don't you want to see your child?" She asked. "Don't answer that. It's none of my business." She shook her head.
"No. It's fine." I shook my head. "My wife. She um went unconscious while in birth and I. I just want to wait to see our child because I want to see if it's a he or she with my wife. I want it to be just how she imagined it." I smiled.
She nodded. "I'm sorry about your wife. I'm sure she will pull through." She smiled.
I nodded. "Thank you" I said. "Cara come on let's leave the baby to sleep. I'm gonna call grandma and grandpa." I said
"Okay daddy." She said and we left out.
"Hello." I said as I sat down in the hospitals waiting area.
"Hey Devin." Mrs. Carter said. I could tell she wasn't feeling very well.
"I have news." I said to her.
"I pray it's good." She said sniffling.
"Yes ma'am. The baby is up. Of course in NICU." I said
"That's great. Did you find out what it is? Have you seen em?" She asked excitedly
"No. I'm waiting for Lauren." I told her and she went silent.
"Nothing about my baby yet?" She asked.
"No ma'am. I'm praying. I know you are." I said.
"Yes I am. Look we are coming back down there. I just had to get the blood off me." She said and I nodded.
When Lauren started to bleed, mama Carter was holding up her leg.
"I understand." I said.
"Devin I need for her to be okay." She confided.
