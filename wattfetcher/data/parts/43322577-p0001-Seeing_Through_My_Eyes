I guess I will write a author's note here, but really I fell like it should be for copyright. This story is kind of a fanfic of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Don't close the book now! I read the book and my left brain thought Wouldn't be fun to write a version of A Midsummer Night's Dream? My right brain said Yeah! Let's do this!  So there we go that's how this book started.
I do not own the characters Shakespeare does even though he is dead.
Yes Puck will be in here.
