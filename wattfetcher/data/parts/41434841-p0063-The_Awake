Today my grandmother turned around in her chair quickly and reached for me, I flinched really hard and dropped my water, it got all over the floor and she started laughing then I freaked out and started crying and now she feels bad because I did something stupid.
Great job me. Just. Ugh.
I can't believe I did that. I know my grandmother wouldn't hit me.
