Okay, So I have been trying to get my hair cut short for a year. My mother took me to go get it cut yesterday.

Oh but guess what
I've been to the same person who cut my hair twice, yesterday being the second time

She did not cut my hair short stating "It doesn't matter if the hair is short or long as long as it has form?"

no\
no
wrong
it obviously does matter because if it didn't, I don't know, I might of not GONE TO CUT MY HAIR IN THE FIRST PLACE

My hair is up to my shoulder
I asked for it to have guy style in the back and to have regular bangs
she got the bangs right Kind of.

I'll feel bad if I tell my mom that wasn't AT ALL how I wanted it

So what should I do? I mean I could just deal with my hair and go to the graduation looking like an angry scene kid
but I would rather have short hair
