"Thanks. Please, may it work!" England said softly. Not averting his gaze from the enemy, England raised a fist to his side. "Japan, give me your hand!" he instructed, to which his comrade obeyed. "Legilimens!"




"Japan, can you hear me?"


"I can hear you directly in my brain?!... England, what's going on?"


"Sorry if this is too sudden. I pried open your mind and linked it to mine. ... In other words, I linked our powers, too."


"You mean we share our powers? I can use the same kind of power as you?"


"You can't use my techniques, but we can fight by combing them through the link. We'll stay like this until one of us either dies or passes out."


"So, our individual powers will be twice as strong? ...Sounds promising."


"However, we will also take some of each others damage. Brace yourself for that."


"...Very well. Once again, let's go!!"



>>Joint attacking has become possible. The joint skill "Island Country" is now available to execute with both England and Japan in the same team.<<




"Let's go! I'll lift the spell!" England exclaimed, adrenalin rushing through him.



Resuming their battle, the two island countries attacked the alien-like monster with their newfound strength. This time, their hits on the creature finally looked like it was causing it damage. Slowly but surely, their attacks were deteriorating the enemy's energy.


"YoU...Won't...Esc...aPe..." It cried out as it attacked back.


Both countries weren't giving up, with their joint skill, they landed a critical hit on the monster, making it hiss angrily. "dIE!"



"It's tone is different somehow when it said the last word." Japan thought as he hit the creature with his katana.
