Hiya so likeI realize I'm not tht funny anymore
I need inspirationSomething to Fangirl or just rant about
I'll end this book otherwise
But I like this book in a wayI get to talk to all of you silly people and make you laugh
AnywaysLet's rant about school
Why is it so much harder now
I'm serious like"BISH I barely know my name, how do you expect me to know how to do anything at all."
It's like
Teacher; what's your name?Me: sandy di'Angelo- I mean sandy Ramirez
Yah That's what I mean
Stop looking at me like that
Staph
Or like when they say "please write a ten page essay on your favorite subject"
Okay Bruh what do you want me to sayLike noMy essay would be something like this"Well I hate school I would rather go home and read gay Fanfiction, thus I am not doing shit for this."
*leaves to read gay fanfic*
Gay fanfics are my friendsThey understandHowTrulyGayIAm

Did I ever tell you my love for dolphins made out of marshmallows?
They're so yummy and squishy and cute and yah
And oh oh ohSo guys Tbh I wouldn't survive as a demigodI would feel so bad killing monsters idk I'm weird
It's like"NO SANDY IT WANTS TO EAT YOU!"
"MAYBE IT JUST WANTS LOVE!"
*dies*
That's pretty much my demigod life all together
Yah so I got nothing to do so I'll goI have a dentist appointment tomorrow
Wish me luck sassy dolphins
