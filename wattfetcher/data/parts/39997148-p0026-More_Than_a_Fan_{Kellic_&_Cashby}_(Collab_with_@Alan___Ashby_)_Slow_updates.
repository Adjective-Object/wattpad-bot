"Alright so Pierce is doing sound check and then we're going to go right after them." Tino said.
"Sounds good to me." I said, "I'm gonna go shower."
"Why? Who are you impressing tonight?"
"I think you know why." I said winking at him and headed off to the bathroom.
I walked to the small bathroom and quickly showered, considering this water go cold real quick if you took too long.
Once I got out I looked around and realized I didn't bring my clothes in here with me. I sighed and wrapped a towel around my waist and walked to my bunk. I grabbed some random boxers and dropped my towel just as Alan pushed his bunk curtain open.
"Oh my god! I'm so sorry!" He squealed, blushing a deep red and shutting the curtain. I pulled on the boxers.
"Dude it's fine." I said laughing as I finished getting dressed.
"Can I look at you now?"
"Yes."
He opened the curtain carefully and sighed when he saw I was dressed, "I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to do that and just wow , I-"
"Alan, its fine." I said cutting him off, he's so cute when he's flustered.
"Okay, okay." He said and got out of his bunk, "Again, sorry."
I shook my head, "Stop saying sorry. Besides it's not a big deal."
"Well you have a very big deal- oh my god. I'm sorry, I'm just gonna g-go." He said blushing, quickly grabbing his camera and a few other things and walking away from me and soon I heard the bus door shut. As soon as I knew he was gone I let out the laughter that was threatening to come out the whole time he was talking.
"Hey we have sou-what's so funny?" Aaron asked.
After I calmed down I looked over at him and grinned, "Well Alan thinks I have a big dick." I told him and walked past him to the door, "Now come on, we have soundcheck."
"What? When? Why did he say that?" He asked as we all walked to sound check.
"Just now."
He just shook his head, "Okay let's get this done."
"Alright!" I said excited, "Tonight's gonna be great."
Soundcheck was a little slow today, but I didn't mind because Alan was taking a few pictures here and there while talking to our manage or on of the sound guys even. He was completely avoiding me and any eye contact. Every time I caught his gaze he would blush and looking away from me. He was so mortified from what happened earlier, it was kind of adorable to be honest.
When sound check ended I saw Alan bolt straight out of the building probably back to the bus. I was tempted to follow him but didn't know if I should or not.
"Hey we're gonna go get some liquor want anything?" Tino asked, "Or to come with."
"No, I think I'm just gonna go hang with Pierce or go to the bus." I said, "See you guys later though."
They all said a goodbye before we all walked out together and went separate ways. I went to the bus and frowned when I didn't see Alan anywhere.
"Alan?"
"Uh, in the back." He called out. I went to the back lounge and saw him looking through his camera, "I'm really sorry about earlier."
