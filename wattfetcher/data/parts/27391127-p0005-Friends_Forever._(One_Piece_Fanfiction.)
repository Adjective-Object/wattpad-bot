"You ain't my father!" Sakura shouted. Then realizing what she said, apologized to herself and vowed never to do it again.
"You're weird." Aya noted.
"You're weirder." Sakura answered.
"You're both weird." Haruka answered looking at the ground.
"Says the Ace-obessed gay freak."
"I'M NOT GAY!!!!!!!"
"We started on the wrong note now let's introduce ourselves properly." Aya said separating the two from the deadliest stare-off imaginable.
"My name is Sakura and I'm a transfer student who ate the Drago Drago no mi Model Sky. I'm a Sky Dragon Slayer."
"My name is Aya and I ate the Uni Uni Model Pink Fluffy. I'm an angel Pink Fluffy Unicorn."
"No wonder you're so weird."
"My name is Haruka and I'm a black-lightning demon who uses two katanas." He explained softly. In  truth, Haruka was a cold, heartless being. He rarely spoke, but when he did, it was to criticize people or to call out to none other than Ace. He is extremely vain. And he hopes Ace thinks he is sexy.
"So cool!" Sakura answered with her eyes sparkling.
"Yeah, I know I'm awesome." Haruka answered running his hand through his hair.
"I wasn't talking about you dumbass, I was talking about my room." Sakura explained  concentrating more on her room.
Haruka fell on the ground and started sobbing.
"Haruka, what's wrong?"
"I got defeated. I won't lose to this dragon!" HE exclaimed.
"What's he doing?" Sakura asked.
"No idea."
Back to the rooms..
Their dorm was pretty big was right at the top of the Sky Island. There they had a view of the majority of the Grandline Academy. There were three bedrooms, each tailored to suit the student.
Sakura's own was sky blue and had snowflakes on the walls. Her bed was large and circled-shaped. She had a closet and numerous shelves.
Aya's room was pink and glittery. Her bed is similar to Sakura's own due to the fact that they're Zoan-type users.
Haruka's room however was green and he had a normal king-sized bed. But he thoroughly complained about the shape of the beds because, "They're so much softer."
Next, there was a boy's bathroom, a girl's bathroom, the living room and the kitchen. Just in case, you're wondering... Aya doesn't cook.
"Her food tastes like crap and its full of glitter." Sakura complained one time.
"My food doesn't suck." Aya cried.
"Yes, it it fucking terrible." Haruka hissed.
"Bad Haruka." Aya cried slapping him. Sakura merely scooted her chair away from the scene.
"Scary unicorn."
"I'm not scary. I'm an angel Pink Fluffy Unicorn!"
