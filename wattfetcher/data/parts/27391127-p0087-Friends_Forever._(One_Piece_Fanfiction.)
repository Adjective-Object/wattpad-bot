"You know what they call people like you..... a rapist."
"A what now?"
"A rapist."
"Then you're a slut!"
"Fucking dick-ass rapist."
"Bitchy-ass slut."
Unknowingly, they entered the dark tunnel which had some crazy turns.
"Get off of me." Hancock shouted, being pushed against the wall by the mass of matter called Haruka's body, his bands tickled her face. Going round another corner, this time, Hancock's chest being smashed his face.
"Get your over-sized tits away from me." Haruka spat before they took a another corner.

Haruka then realizing that Hancock that either fainted or probably knocked her head and fell  unconscious. Either way, he was not going to be seen with this bitch in his hands. So as the light grew brighter, he picked the unconscious Empress and used the Geppou to get out the tunnel before crash landing.
"What the hell was that?" Marco and Shanks asked.
"HARUKA! I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!" Hancock screamed.
"Bitch please....I SHOULD FUCKING EXECUTE YOU!"
Marco and Shanks only sweatdropped.
Back to the threesome......
Law looked up and saw the sign 'Love Tunnel.'
"Mugiwara-ya, get off this ride before you drown."
"What about you!"
"You're shorter than me."
"What about Aya!"
"I'll save her."
"Then why can't you save me!"
"Because you're a loud mouthed idiot."
Luffy got sad and Aya smiled at him in her weakened state.
"Its okay Luffy. *pukes in mouth* I'll save you." Aya answered.
"Shishishishi. Thank you Aya."
They entered the tunnel. Facing the same punishment, a certain duo faced before.
"Luffy!"
"Sorry Aya-chan."
"I'm not sorry." Law thought as Aya's chest was in his face. Turning around the next corner, the opposite happened.
"Aya!"
"Gomen ne, Luffy!"
"Don't feel sorry for him!" Law shouted, knowing that he himself was literally onto of Aya. The only light was Aya's glowing red face.
"Aya, are you okay?" Luffy asked.
