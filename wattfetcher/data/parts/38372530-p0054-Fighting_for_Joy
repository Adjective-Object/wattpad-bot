I nodded my head. "Well then ask your daddy when we will have a new baby."
"Oh okay." She said and shrugged. They ordered their food and I tended to little Devin. I am not hungry at all. Just tired. The girls ran rapid in those stores.
"Hello." I said answering my phone as I got into the truck.
"Hey Lauren baby. I was thinkin bout you."
"Were you mommy?" I asked.
"Mmhm. How you been?" She asked.
"Good." I said
"How you really feeling? I know you gotta be tired." She said concerned.
"I'm tired but hey, I'm a mommy." I told her.
"That's true. Hey why don't you bring the kids over. Take a load off." She told me.
"Mama I'm fine." I told her.
"No you're not. Bring them kids Lauren." She told me.
I sighed. "Okay mama."
"Mmhm you drop all three of my babies off. They got clothes over here and they'll be fine."
"I will be their at three. I have to pump." I said looking at the clock to see it was 1:30."
"That boy don't drink no milk no more. He eat table food!" She told me.
"Ma you been giving my baby table food?"I asked her.
"Mmhm. He drink a little ginger ale too."
"Soda ma! For real?" I asked her.
"Girl hush up. I had how many kids?" She asked me.
"Mama I know how many you had but soda?" I asked her.
"He had to burp. I ain't give em a lot and it ain't got no caffeine in it. Relax chile."
I sighed. "Mama please don't give my baby no more soda."
"Mmhm." She said and hung up.
I sighed and looked in my back seat. "Y'all wanna go by Grammy and Papi house?"
"Oh yes!" Cara clapped.
"Can we stay the night?" Melanie asked.
"Grammy wouldn't have it any other way." I said.
"I can no wait!" Cara said happily
"Why do you like going to Grammy and Papi house so much? Why y'all don't like being with mommy and daddy?" I asked
"Because at Grammy and Papi house we get to have fun!" Melanie said.
"Well what's fun?" I asked her.
"We get to have ice cream and pie after dinner, and we get to have whatever we want for breakfast and Grammy lets us have cookies and sweet cereal!"
"No two percent milk either." Cara chimed in.
"Oh so that's why?" I asked them.
"Yeah and we get to stay up past bedtime and- and"
"Everything you can't do at mommy and daddy's house huh?" I asked.
"Oh. Sorry mommy." Cara said.
I sighed. "It's fine."
I pulled up into the driveway and my mother was on the porch. I discreetly rolled my eyes. She always want my kids.
