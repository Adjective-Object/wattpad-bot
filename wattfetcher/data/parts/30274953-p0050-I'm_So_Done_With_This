So my people on Facebook are posting shit like 'God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.' Well news for you if God didn't want Gay people in this world there wouldn't be any. And secondly, don't judge people like it's your business, only God can judge them. So news for those people, keep your opinion to yourself. If you have nothing nice to say don't say it at all. Just think about if you were in their shoes. Get over yourselves for the love of kittens.
Yes, it might be different. And yes it is uncomfortable to see, but it's just where this is a new thing. It's where you're not exposed to that stuff, so when you get older it's just weird to your eyes. But they love their girlfriend or boyfriend. And if you love someone you don't give them up just for rude assholes who think they have the right to get all up in their business.
I think I'm done ranting right now.
