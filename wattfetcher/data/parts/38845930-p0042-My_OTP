Erin's POV
"Tell me, Jardon." I said.
"Shut up." He laughed.
"Jordan, you can't do that! You can't start to say something and then not finish it, tell me Jardon." I ordered.
"Okay jeez, I was just gonna say that you look beautiful all the time."
"Shut up." I said before kissing him.
"I love you and your constant beautifulness, even when you scare me which you have to promise you won't do again." He said.
"I love you." I said.
We kept saying it to eachother, over and over and over again.
"You scare me sometimes." I said breaking the chain of "I love you"s.
"When?" He asked.
"When you fought with that drunk guy and and when you and (insert ex's name here) started fighting and when I kissed you for the first time and you ran to the bathroom, you made me think things that had no reason to be thought." I said rubbing his thigh
"What did I make you think?" He asked.
"I thought you would never talk to me again or you would hate me... I even thought you might not take me home and leave me at Steve's, but then I couldn't stand and I fell and you caught me -- IÂ  could tell you cared about me." I said.
"Since then, I knew we'd be together... I was right." He said.
"Oh, Jordan." I said grabbing his arm and leaning my head on his shoulder.
My phone sitting next to me started ringing, it was my ex.
"Hello?" I asked expecting (insert ex's name here) to reply.
"Mommy!? Are you okay?" Boo asked.
"Hi sweetie, I'm okay." I said.
"Daddy told me what happened and I want to come see you." She said.
"No!" I screamed.
"Why? I want to come see you." She said as she started to cry.
"Your not going!" Her dad yelled in the background giving me the feeling she was crying even more.
"No no, you can come." I said looking at Jordan. "Can you get her?" I mouthed. "I can't be around him." He mouthed back. "Please." I mouthed as I bit my lip. "Only because I love you." he mouthed.
"You want Jordan to pick you up?" I asked.
"Yes? Daddy can Jordan come pick me up?" She asked.
"Jordan? You really think I would that f -- "
"Daddy!" Boo yelled.
"Please say yes." I whispered while crossing my fingers.
"Please daddy." Boo asked.
"Fine! but he's not coming in, your gonna run out and when he drops you off your gonna run back inside, you hear me!?" He yelled.
Jordan left and texted me when he got there.
"Boo is coming to the car, I haven't seen (insert ex's name here)."
"Good! Is Boo okay?" I asked.
"She is a bit sad still." He responded.
"Poor Boo." I said.
They got back and Boo ran to the bed and hopped on it to give me a hug.
