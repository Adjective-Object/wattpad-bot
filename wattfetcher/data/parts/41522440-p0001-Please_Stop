Luke Hemmings, he's changed a lot in just two years. He used to be fun. Now he's uptight. He used to love. He used to be kind and caring. Now he could care less about anything and everything.
Luke lives in an apartment in LA. He works at a very important business. He works at Hi Or Hey records.
Luke has always been told he's a great guitar player and wonderful singer. Though Luke never found interest in being famnous. He keeps to himself. At work he does his job, and thats it.
At Luke's job he tells people what to do. He also works in the studio and helps people record records.
Luke doesn't smile.
Like he never smiles.
Then there's Kaylee Smith. She has also changed a lot in two years. In the first year of Luke's absents, she was very distant. Now she's very loving and caring. Its almost as if she forgot about Luke. She still lives with Michael, Ashton, Calum, and of course Elena, in the great Australia.
Kaylee works two jobs. She is a vet, and a part time photographer. Kaylee loves her jobs. She stays focused all the time.
Calum has a theory that she stays focused and busy so she doesn't have time to think. So that he won't come to her mind.
Michael makes sure no one ever mentions him.
Elena she hardly remembers anything about him.
Ashton well he misses Luke, alot. They all do, but out of the guys Ashton misses him the most. I guess you could say Luke and Ashton were the closest out of all the guys.
Harry, yes I'm sure your curious about him. He moved a few house down from the rest. Him and his family are very happy and they always visit Kaylee and the rest of the group.
Now, if you care, Chief..yes the dog. He's still alive. He still lives with Kaylee and the rest. He's always by Kaylee's side at all times. Even when she's at her jobs.
