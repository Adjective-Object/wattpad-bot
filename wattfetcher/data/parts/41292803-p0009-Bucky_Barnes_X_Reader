I woke up and winced. My neck was so sore, as well as my ribs. I groaned as I sat up. Bucky had fallen asleep next to my bed. His metal hand was in my lap. I remembered I held it whenÂ I fell asleep.
I wondered absently if his hair was really soft. I got out of bed softly and walked around. He was slumped up against the bed. I began combing through his tangled hair with my fingers. It really was soft. Suddenly, I remembered that I had some bobby pins in my back pocket. I twisted his hair into a cute man bun. I smiled. He looked so cute. I rested my head on his shoulder and wrapped my arms around his chest.
About 15 minutes later, he woke up. The first thing he noticed was his hair. He reached up to touch it, but his elbow smacked against my head. He turned around and immediately began saying,

Oh my gosh. I am so sorry. Are you ok? Gosh I am so sorry.

I laughed so hard.

Its ok Bucky. Really. I am sorry I messed with your hair.

Its fine. I was just surprised. Are you sure your ok?

Yes. I am positive.

How is your neck?

Sore. Very sore.

Let me see.

I lifted my chin. He pushed my hair away and gently touched and felt my neck. I winced.

You have some very bad bruising. You should really get it looked at.

I know.

Why did the guard do this to you?

I wouldn't give him a kiss.

Why not?

Because he is Hydra, stupid, and mean. Plus I want my first kiss to be special.

You have never been kissed?

Nope. What about you?

Not that I remember. But that doesn't mean anything.

Would. Would you teach me how to fight?

Why?

I want to be able to defend myself.

I suppose I could teach you.

Great! But not now. I need another day of rest.
