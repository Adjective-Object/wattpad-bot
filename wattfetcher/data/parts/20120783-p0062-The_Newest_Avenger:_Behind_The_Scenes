Unfortunately, the next update is a boring filler chapter and I really don't want to have you all wait a week for that and then another week for a slightly less boring chapter. So, I'm gonna post it on Tuesday and then the next chapter, it starts off kinda boring but gets more interesting, will be up on Saturday. That sound good my people?
Hope you all enjoyed this update and I will see all of you on Tuesday.
Don't die.
