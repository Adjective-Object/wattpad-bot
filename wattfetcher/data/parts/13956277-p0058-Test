"BEEP BEEEEEP"
I woke up from my sweet dream because of the annoying voice of my Alarm.
"IKHRASS" but that didn't work, it didn't stop beeping.
"You can't tell the alarm to shut up, it won't response" And here comes 'the nerves burner' Damon to ruin my day from the beginning.
"Get out" I rubbed my eyes and yawned.
"I'm behind the door, out your room" He chuckled.
He'd keep annoying me so I ignored him.
-Secret Admirer.
Memories of what happened yesterday started to play over and over in my brain.
He knows where I live ...
He knows where I work...
He sneaked into my room...
What if he is watching me right now ?
I had closed the windows and curtains before I changed my clothes.
I opened the fridge and looked for something 100% halaal to eat, I only found tomatoes.
mind: Poor Leena, only tomatoes for breakfast ha ?
me: Ikhras, who woke you up ?
"Morning sleeping beauty"
"Before I close the fridge and meet your face ... Are you fully clothed or half naked as always ?" I kept looking inside the fridge for something else.
"I'm fully clothed"
"Hamdullah" I sighed.
"I made some coffee, want some ?" He passed my a beaker of coffee.
"Thank you" I put some milk and sugar in it then walked out the house.
"At least you can sip it with me" He said sadly.
"No thanks"
"Stop being cold like before ! You finally became good but after the sleepover you changed ! What happened to you" He asked furiously.
"I was wrong, I shouldn't have become good with you from the first place" I opened the door.
"I like you Leena, I really do" I froze. I turned around to see him staring at me with hopeful eyes.
"It was obvious from the begining that you stole my heart the moment you stepped in the house, Leena please-"
"Enough Damon, that's enough" I stepped out.
"Don't you have feelings? Haven't you ever liked someone" He blocked me.
"I do have feelings *Pause* But I don't want to set them free"
"Just try"
"Don't waste your time Mr.Carter, I didn't come searching for love, I don't even have anytime for it. I came to gain a degree and become a Doctor"
"You can't hold your feelings forever, you'll fall for someone at the end" He smirked.
"But it definitly won't be you" I closed the door.
You can't hold your feelings forever, you'll fall for someone at the end ...
