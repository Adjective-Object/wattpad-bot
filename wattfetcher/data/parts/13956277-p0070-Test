"Meow"
"What's that ?" Her beautiful eyes widened.
"Meow" A little cat crawlled from the bed and jumped on Leena's Leg.
"Hey ! You're up" Elina came in.
"Can someone explain, why is there a baby cat biting my big toe" Here comes her eyebrow-move.
"We found it in your closet with a huge pink bow ... didn't you buy it ?" Elina's expression showed confusion.
"Ya Allah" Leena rubbed her face and I noticed that she started to lose her balance so I ran to her.
"Are you Okay ?" I asked worriedly.
"I'm perfect, just get out" Why ? Just why ?
"Okay" I walked out.
"Wait !" My heart skipped a beat and I turned around, and I wish I didn't.
"Take these" And she threw the roses at me and shut the door.
"DON'T DENY IT LEENA, YOU WANT ME AS MUCH AS I WANT YOUR SEXY FACE" Okaaay... that was stupid.
I heard the door crack open, I ran to it ... and I regret that too.
Leena came holding a jug filled with water and drowned me from head to toe.
"Even If you throw me in the ocean I'll keep trying until you come and begg me to go on a date with you" I smirked. Why do I keep doing and saying stupid things ?
"NO NO NO JUS- I'm sorry sorry just don't throw the jug" I ran downstairs.
..
Leena's POV:
I held a chuckle and closed the door.
"I'm gonna kill him one day" I told Elina.
"Please do it soon" Elina giggled "Let's have a seat" "What happened ?" I asked.
"Well ... We heard a bang and came running, we saw your head bleeding and freaked out but, thank god Simon was here"
"Simon ?" Then the memories came back, he already came with us.
"Yeah Simon, he ran and saved you" Simon ? He's a courage man, smart student, has good manners  and he's a nurse, He's a ....... SUPERMAN.
"Hold on, I have a bandage on my head ... DID HE TAKE MY HIJAB OFF" I freaked out !!!!
"No, he made a litte cut in it and we put some tape on his eyes so he wouldn't be able see your hair .. OF COURSE HE DID"
"WHY DID YOU LET HIM" I scolded her
"It was either him or the doctor that will take us an hour to reach and until that you'd have bleeded way more than you did. To be honest, he stared at you with surprise for two second *giggles* but then he consintrated and left right after he lied you in bed" She explained. I think these two seconds were enough to keep my face detailed in his brain.
"LIED ME IN BED ! YA ALLLAHHH" I slapped myslef.
"And Damon ?" I'm scared that Damon saw me uncovered too.
"Don't worry, me and Simon kicked him out.
"But that is NOT AN EXCUSE TO LET SIMO-"
"Shut up Leena, if he hadn't come you would've probably been in the ICU now" Elina scolded me, "Astaghferollah, he did save my- BUT HE'S NOT A DOCTOR " I said angrily.
