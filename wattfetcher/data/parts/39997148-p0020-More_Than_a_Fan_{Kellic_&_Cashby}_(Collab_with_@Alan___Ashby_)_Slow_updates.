"Its not different this time. You say these kinds of things an then you screw it up. Then you get angry, then you mope, then you're mad again. Its a never ending cycle till you find someone to screw, which hopefully isn't Alan. But after that, said person gets mad, calls you all the time before you get pissed cause they won't stop and next thing you know you're back at Jaxin and then the cycle repeats."
"It's not going to be like that this time!" I said getting annoyed, "I promise you it's different."
"So he isn't just going to be a rebound? You actually want to start something?"
"Maybe," I said not really sure if I even want to be in a relationship.
"Maybe?"
"Yeah maybe," I told them. "It depends on where it goes or whatever."
Aaron sighed, "Just don't be an idiot."
"I won't be don't worry." I told them.
"I'd love to keep doing this but we have to go inside." Phil said.
"Yeah we do, now let's go." I said and stood up. "Alan we have to go!"
"Coming!"   He walked out with his camera and a small bag.
"Ready to get to the venue?" I asked him as I headed to the door.
"Yeah, I'm excited to do all this for you guys." He said excited, "It's going to be so much fun!"
I nodded, "Come on."  I said and we all left the bus and went to the venue quickly.
"Who's on right now?" He asked.
"PVRIS, then Slaves, Pierce then us." I told him.
"Alright well, I am going to go take some pictures and you guys can go do whatever it is you're supposed to." He said before walking off.
"Is it cool if I go with you?" I asked catching up to him.
"Sure if you want to."
"Awesome, so what all are you going to take pictures of?" I asked as we walked around.
"The crowd, probably a few of PVRIS even, I really like them. Kind of anything till Pierce and you guys go on." He said as we walked, "Maybe I can take a few of you now if you want." He offered.
"Sounds fun," I said happily.
He nodded, "Can you hold this for me?" He asked handing me the little bag he had.
"Of course."
"Thanks."
"No problem," I said smiling as he started to take pictures, "What's in here anyway?"
"Lenses, memory cards. Ya know, camera stuff."
"Oh that's cool." I said tempted to look through it.
"Yeah, you can look at them. Just be careful they don't come cheap."
"Awesome." I said rifling through the bag looking at all of the cool different things in it.
"Can you hand me fisheye lens?" He asked after a while.
"Uh which one is that?" I asked looking at all of the different lenses.
He turned to me and twisted the one he had off before switching them out and taking the middle one out, "This one."
"Oh what does that do?" I asked curiously.
"Its really cool. I'll show you in a minute." He said taking a few photos, "See."
