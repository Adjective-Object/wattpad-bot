I woke up by the sound of my annoying alarm clock that was sitting on my nightstand beside my single bed. I quickly grabbed it and press stop so I wouldn't disturb my roommate that was actually snoring when I looked over to see if I woke her up.
She would kill me if I woke her up.
I sighed in relief when I saw that she's sleeping soundly and laugh a little when I saw her position.
She's on her stomach, and one of her legs and arms was tangling out of her bed. I don't really know how she can sleep like that but I guess she's very comfortable right now.
I can really see that.
I decided to go back to sleep because hey! It's Saturday and Saturday means sleeping, lots and lots of sleeping.
I lay down again and I was about to fall asleep when someone knocked the door.
I tried to avoid the person who knocked again right now but failed when the sound grew louder.
"STOP KNOCKING THE DOOR, YOU LITTLE RAT GRASSHOPPER" My best friend and roommate, Elaine, yelled clearly pissed at the person who's knocking the door.
This is what I'm talking about, so much for being quiet.
"OPEN THE DAMN DOOR YOU LAZY FAT ASSHEAD!!" A male voice suddenly yelled back.
I sighed as I easily recognized the voice of Jayden. Jayden is my other best friend who likes to go to our dorm every time he had a chance.
I sit up slowly and throw my blankets away from me. I glanced to Elaine and to the door, and slowly shake my head to them.
"YOU DARE TO WOKE ME UP WHILE I'M SLEEPING YOU UGLY DUCKLING FROG!!" Elaine yelled
"WELL!! IM GONNA LIE IF I SAY I'M SORRY BECAUSE I AM NOT SORRY AT ALL, SO WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR ASS IN HERE AND OPEN THE DOOR OR ELSE-"
"OR ELSE WHAT? HUH?!" Elaine interrupted.
" OR ELSE I'M GONNA CHOPPED YOUR ASS OFF AND PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD SO YOU'LL OFFICIALLY BECOME AN ASSHEAD!!"
I tried not to show how entertained I was because Elaine will totally get pissed at me, especially now that she's very angry by just looking at her face.
"I'm coming, Jayden" I yelled to put a stop to this ridiculous argument.
As I walked to the door, I heard Elaine mumbled something about how she got a friend and something about gay.
I smiled as I shake my head. This two are always like this. Giving insults to each other but not to me, very odd if you ask me.
I opened the door and was greeted by a very worried Jayden who looks like wanted to explode any minute now.
I frowned at him and opened my mouth, ready to ask what's wrong but completely cut off when Jayden suddenly wrapped his arm around me and started saying something that I completely don't understand.
I noticed the other people looking at us like we're annoying and other people who's whispering to each other.
I quickly grabbed Jayden's arm and pulled him inside while I closed the door.
