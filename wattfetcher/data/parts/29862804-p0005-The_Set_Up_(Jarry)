"Why did he say that Harry? It hurts like hell." Harry wiped my tears with his hand.
"Jadey don't cry please okay he doesn't deserve such a beautiful, cute and nice girl like you. Why you didn't tell me? I'm always here for you Jade you can tell me whatever you want."
"I didn't want to bother you Harry it's my problem you don't have to share it with me." I stopped crying. Harry looked deep in my eyes.
"Don't say that again Jade, you don't bother me and I want to share it with you. You need to talk to someone and I'm here always here." He smlied his gorgeous smile that makes me feel better.
"Thanks Harry. I feel good now."
"No thanks between us Jadey." I smiled looking for my phone to see the clock. It was 8 o'clock it's not late.
"I bought something for you it will make you feel better." He searched in his pocket when he found it; it was a bow! He gave it to me.
"Thanks Hazza it's really beautiful." I smiled looking at the bow.
"But not beautiful as you." Harry said putting his hands behind his back.
"What are you hiding Harry?" I tried to look but he didn't let me see.
"It's something for you ."
"What is it?" I asked. Harry gave me a bow it was beautiful and I liked because it's from him.
"Thanks alot Hazza you didn't have to buy it." I said smiling .
"It's nothing Jadey hope you like it." He smiled at me, his eyes were shinning I love looking at them.
"I liked it alot thanks Hazza." Harry's phone rang again but this time it wasn't simon it was his mum Anne.
"Hello mum, I'm with Jade." after 5 minutes he hung up. I checked my phone again, there was a large amount of notification because of twitter.
"Why are you checked the clock from time to time ? Do you have something to do ? " Harry asked , I'm acting a little bit weird but my mum told me not to be late so I don't want to forget the time .
" My mum told me don't be late . " It was half past nine . We walked for an hour , the new shoes hurts my feet .
" Harry my feet started to hurt me and I think I should go home thanks for today , I enjoyed with you . "
" Okay Jadey take care of yourself , if you need anything just call me . " Harry said hugging tight . I'm going to miss him when I arrived home mum wasn't at home I went to my room . I changed into my one piece pyjama . I smiled looking at the bow in my hand . Harry is really nice he's the only one who made me feel better after my break up with Sam . I wrote my dairies.
Then I checked my phone there was a tweet from Harry it says ' Had a great time with @JadeThirlwall . ' I replied to him then I went to sleep . This is the first night I sleep smiling after my break up with Sam .
