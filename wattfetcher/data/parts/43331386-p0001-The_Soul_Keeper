I've heard many things about souls. They go to Heaven. They just exist. But the strangest I've ever heard is the legend of the Soul Keeper. The ending of the story goes like this:

The Soul Keeper is a lion tamer to the angry souls and clown for joyful ones. For you see, The Soul Keeper is the master of all souls lost or found.

I've been inturpriting it all my life and never understood it.
