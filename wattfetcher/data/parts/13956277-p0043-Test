"I BOUGHT YOU SOME FRIED POTATOES WITH SPICES, YOUR FAVORITES" My heart skipped a beat, POTATO.
I ran down the sairs and slipped.
"AAAAAAAAAH I'M FALLING"
"Gotcha" Damon ran and caught me with both of his hands.
"Ewwww, put me down" I pushed him.
"You are welcome" He frowned
"Gi'mme mah potatoes"
"Here you go" Elina handed it to me
"Where's Mrs.Carter" I put a some potatoes in my mouth
"In work as usual. Gotta go to the WC, be right back" Elina ran to the bathroom.
"I shoulld call my parents" I said fearly
"You don't need- OH okay" Damon seems weird today, which is my last worry.
"Give me my phone, it fell on the floor when I slipped" I kept eating
"And who am I ? The new maid or something?" He asked sarcastically but he brought it.
"Assalamu Alaykom"
"Wa alaykom al salaam" Dad answered
"So, when is my flight" my voice broke
"What flight" Dad asked
"My flight to Jordan"
"Well, *Clears throat* Me and your mother discussed that and ..."
"And what"
"If you're happy there, you can stay" Dad said, I jumped in happiness.
"REALLY DAD"
"Yeah, but there's one problem, or a punishment as you might think"
"What is it, I'm ready for anything" I smiled
"I won't send you money anymore" Is he kidding me ?
"Father, you are hilarious" I laughed
"No, I am serious. If you think you're old enough to stay in America with a family that has a man in it, you must be old enough to have a job and support yourself. from now on, all I'm paying for is your education and I'll only give you 150 dollars a month. Get a job and support yourself, prove that you can take care of yourself and I'll let you stay"
WHAT IS WRONG WI- at least he let me stay.
"Okay dad thank you I r-
"If Damon didn't speak to me I wouldn't have let you stay"
"Damon did WHAT ?" Damon tensed in front of me and dropped the potatoes .
"He didn't tell you ? he called me 5 hours ago" Damon turned his heels but I caught his shirt before he could run away.
I moved the phone away "You are not going anywhere" I whispered to Damon and put the phone back on my ear.
"Oh, I'll ask him. Thank you dad"
"I have to go now, I'll keep an eye on you, No more lies Okay ? salaam" He hung up.
"Come here" I pulled Damon's shirt and he fell on the couch.
"Where did you get my father's number from"
"What are you talking about" He seemed so innocent.
"Are you gonna tell me easily or do I have to stab you with a fork and put candles in your eyes" I said seriously.
