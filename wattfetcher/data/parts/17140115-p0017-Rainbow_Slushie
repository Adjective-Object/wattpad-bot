Hi! Rainbow again! So, I decided to list music I am listening to currently.
-Error:Operator by Taking Back Sunday-Misery Business by Paramore-A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More "Touch Me" by Fall Out Boy-Dance Hall Drug by Boys Like Girls-Call You Out by Flyleaf-Like a Knife by Secondhand Serenade
And that's all. I don't care if you think this music is emo. I love these songs. Also, favorite song is:-Welcome to My Life by Simple Plan
So, yeah.... I hope you check these songs out and like them.  Please don't hate on them! It's just my opinion! Ok, anyways baiiiiii! Watashi wa kawaii!!!!!!
