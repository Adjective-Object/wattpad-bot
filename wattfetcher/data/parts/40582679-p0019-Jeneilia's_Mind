Hi again to whoever freaking read.
So if anyone knows me they know I don't like saying 'byes' and if I do I'm just annoyed with youâ€š upset or sad. Yesterday I was texting you and we were talking then you said u gtg your friend is gonna shave your legs so I was like 'ok' then your friend texted me and after talking for a little I told her I gtg because I was studying and stuff and then u texted back saying hi its you and I said "hi but I still have to go" since I was studying and I wanted u to have fun with your friend/ s but then you texted back "okay whatever BYE" and I didn't text back cause I was like really shocked and I just stopped thinking about it but now it flashed back in my mind and I'm just like u could have just given me an explanation like I would feel a little better if you said "hey Lia I'm annoyed by you now and I don't wanna talk to u anymore" I would just go because why would I stay in someones life who doesn't want me in there I mean yeah I would still feel bad but not as bad because I wouldn't be the one losing someone who loved me.........
