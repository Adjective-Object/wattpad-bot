"Fight then." I say and jump out the window.Before I hit the ground Andy appear below me and catches me, gently setting me down and looks at me.
"That fight isn't about your decision. Its about your family's honor and pride. Your father was attacked unprovoked and that hurt his pride. He's now fighting for its integrity." Andy looks down making his hair cover his face.
"I can tell that you want to be with him Kat.."
"I have to." I say. He falls to one knee. Tears run down his face.
"Why do you have too.?" He asks me.
"If he hurts you I wouldn't know what to do. Please I know this is hard." I say
"He can't hurt me. My body adapts and learns from the damage that its taken.." he says as his tears turns to blood. He wipe them away quickly before I turn and start to walk away.
"Please..don't leave me.." He whispers as i turn the corner and slam my back against the wall feeling like I had made the right decision.
