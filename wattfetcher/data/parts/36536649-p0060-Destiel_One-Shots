"That's good."
"What about you, Dean?"
"All I need is you."
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey
"Really? Me?" Cas looks up at him, astonished.
"Of course." Dean smiles. "Cas, you're the funnest person I know. And the most entertaining. The smartest. The most philosophical. And the most beautiful."
Hey, hey, hey
"Beautiful?" he asks, blue eyes wide and shining.
"The very most."
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
"Are you sure you meant me, and not Lisa? Or my sister?"
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
Dean laughed. "Anna? She's pretty, but she's nothing compared to you."
And that heaven is overrated?
"But you've kissed Anna. Lots." He wasn't wrong. Technically, Dean dated Anna. For about two days. As much as he hated saying it, she was as close to Cas as he could get.
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star-
"Cas, you know I regret that."
"Why?"
"Because I gladly would've kissed you instead."
One without a permanent scar?
Cas put moved his hands from around Dean's neck to his face.
"Dean, I-"
But what he was going to say was absorbed into a kiss. It was a first kiss - well, technically, a second kiss, because there was this one time when Cas was worried because he'd never been kissed - and it was full of innocence and sweetness.
There were quite a few wolf-whistles and someone (and by someone I mean Charlie) yelled "FUCKING FINALLY!"
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
"Love you," Cas finished as they broke apart. "Dean, I love you."
"I love you too, Cas."
