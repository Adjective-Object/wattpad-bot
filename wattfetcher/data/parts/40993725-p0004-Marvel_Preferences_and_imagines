The smell of bacon wakes me up. My hair falls in my face as I turn to face a empty spot on the bed. As I yawn and crack my shoulder, Wade comes in and sits beside me.   "Breakfast is done, Baby. Do you want me to carry you?" Wade asked rather loudly as I slip my glasses on.    "Nah, i got it. Thanks," I replied as i sliped out of bed and snuggled into Wade's chest. He puts a hand on my lower back and guides me downstairs.     "It's pancakes today. By the way, are we out of blue berries?"   "Yep, sorry Babe," I said as I took a joyfull bite of buttery pancakes.  He talked about some kind of special blue berry while I kept a hand on his knee and ate. If one thing was for sure, Wade could make killer pancakes.
