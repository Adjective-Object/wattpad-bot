"Um, I'd have to say that sharing a room with you would be less weird. I mean we are closer both in friendship and age." I said awkwardly.
"CHYA! I FUCKING KNEW IT! GIMME THAT 300 RYO INO PIG!" sakuras voice boomed from bushes.
"SAKURAAAAAAAAA! I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD ILL RIP OFF YOUR ARMS AND LEGS THEN ILL FEED YOU TO ONE OF OROCHIMARUS SNAKES!" Sasuke bellowed angry.
"Sasu!" Sakuras voice suddenly changed to a sweet an innocent one as she approached sasuke.
"ILL FUCKING KILL YOU IF YOU TAKE ONE MORE STEP SAKURA HARUNO!" Sasuke said again. But Sakura was foolish, she simply kept running to him.
"Sasuke don't!!" I said as I dropped my suitcase and wrapped my arms around him to stop him from throwing a punch at the pinkette.
"WHY NOT THAT BITCH NEEDS TO DIE!" Sasuke said trying to release from my grasp, but I held my grip.
"Sakura run! Sasuke might kill you! For real!" I warned as I tightened my grip around sasuke. Itachi had left.
No one at the moment!
A boy was watching as hinata hugged sasuke. Or was she trying to protect Sakura? Making sure sasuke didn't kill her.
She's so kind hearted. The boy thought remembering her caring smile. So he ran up to the soon to be fight and grabbed Sakura, throwing her away as she was frozen in fear.
"You wanna fight so badly uchiha?" The boy asked. "Then you fight me. Not Sakura!"
Sasuke stood still as hinata released him. He gave a smirk that dripped with the venom of his words. "My opponent is you? Naruto uzamaki."
"Yeah, it is. Sasuke uchiha."
"Its been a while. Hasn't it?" Sasuke said.
