I come from a wealthy family, my mother, Malia Parker Lee is a retired doctor. Before my father died, he owned 3 shoe stores, and was a drug lord. 3 years ago, my father passed, he had lung cancer. I'm an only child, so I was spoiled growing up, but I know what it is to struggle.
Before my father died, he wanted two things from me, 1. He wanted me to graduate college with my Bachelor's Degree; 2. He wanted me to be a well known doctor in Florida just like mother.

My best friend who's mixed with black and white name is Kaylee Breanna Lance. My other bestfriend who's mixed with White and Chinese name is Skylar Su Lang Wong. Crazy,right?
