I should be sleep. But instead I'm up trying to think of how imma do longer chapters for y'all. *straight face emoji* it's 2:23 AM. You lucky I love yall I swear. Oh and starting July 1st-16th I won't update as frequently as I usually do because on July 1st me and my mom are flying to Colorado and won't be back until the 16th and while I'm there I'm gonna be busy with family ( my brother, his wife, my nephews) see my brothers in the army and that's why hes all they way in Colorado instead if Florida. He used to be in Texas. ( I loved visiting there)
Now it's 2:26am.
