"They told me to stay away from you okay? Happy now?" I asked annoyed.
"Well why would they do that?"
"Ask them." I said.
Tino rolled his eyes, "Because all he wanted to do was get into your pants."
"Really?"  He asked and turned to me, "Is that true Austin?"
"At first, but over time-"
"Overtime? At first? I just, I thought you were different." He said, "I'm just gonna go to the bus." He said before shaking his head and leaving the venue.
I glared at the guys in front of me, "Thanks a lot. Just so you know I didn't just want to get in his pants."
"Well that's what you told us." Aaron said.
"Things change!" I yelled completely irritated.
"We still told you to stay away. We didn't want this kind of shit happening Austin!"
"Well now it's too fucking late isn't it!"
"Yeah now lets get soundcheck done." Phil said, "We can deal with everything else later."
"Sounds good to me." Aaron said and we all got on stage to go over soundcheck and get everything set up for tonight.
Once we finished we all went back to the bus. I needed to talk to Alan, explain things to him.
"Alan?" I shouted going back to the bunks, "Are you in here?" I pulled open his bunk curtain and saw he wasn't in there. I checked the back lounge and he wasn't there either. "Alan?"
"He's not here Austin."
"He might be at Pierce's bus talking to Kellin." Tino said.
"No, he just texted me. He went on a walk." Aaron said.
"Did he tell you where?" I asked.
"No, he just said he's on a walk and will be back before the show."
"Oh." I said and fell onto the couch in defeat. "Great, just great."
"You'll be able to talk with him, don't worry too much."
"I know but I need to talk to him now, I can't just let this go until we talk."
"Well you're going to have to Aust."
I sighed, "I know."
"Who knows maybe he'll come back early to talk."
Aaron was wrong.  He didn't come back early to talk and by the time PVRIS was on he still hadn't shown up yet either. He finally showed up though, right before Pierce came on.
"Sorry guys." He said walking straight past me to Pierce and talking with them.
"He won't even look at me." I said sadly as I watched him talking to Mike and Tony.
"Just go try and talk to him before he goes to take pictures." Phil said.
"He looks busy though."
"Do you want to talk with him or not?"
I sighed, "Yeah I do."
"Then go."
"Fine." I muttered and left the guys to go talk to Alan.  "Hey Alan, can I, uh, talk to you?"
He turned around and looked at the ground, "Can't I have to go take pictures." He said before walking off.
