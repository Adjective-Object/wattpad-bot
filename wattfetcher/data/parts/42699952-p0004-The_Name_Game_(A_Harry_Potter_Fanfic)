I picked myself up off of the cold, rocky shore and scrambled to the side of the lighthouse as quickly as possible. Hagrid stifled a laugh. I threw a rock at his feet.
"Can you not?" I asked, crossing my arms.
"Yer okay... What's yer name again?"
I rolled my eyes. "Domino."
"Right. Well, Harry Potter should be right through that door." Hagrid said. I pulled out my wand. "How do you have a wand? Yer only ten!"
"The ministry gives me wands and cover-up things. That's why I'm going to Hogwarts. My birthday's in September."
"Great." Hagrid said. "You do the honors. Knock that door down like a domino, Domino."
I smirked and lifted my wand, then yelled, "Alohamora!"
The door crashed down and I jumped into the room, doing a little tumble then standing up and bowing. A fat kid slept on the couch with another kid at the floor. That was Harry, I could tell. He had glasses and the legendary scar.
"Harry!" I screamed, running over to him and hugging him. He stood there like a stone, confused.
"Stop scaring him." Hagrid said, walking into the room after her. He lifted up the door and put in back in place. Frantic steps were heard, and two other people came downstairs. One man was holding a gun.
It was pointed at me.
"How did you get in here?!" He yelled.
"Suck it." I said, casting a silent magic spell at him. The gun twisted itself into a knot, and the tall woman behind him screamed. Hagrid chuckled, and so did Harry. I sat down next to him and smiled.
"I'm Domino." I whispered.
"I'm Harry, Harry Potter."
"Yeah, I know. Did you know you're famous?"
"I'm not famous. I'm Harry. Just Harry."
"Then how would I know you?" I asked. He paused. The kid on the couch looked down at me.
"Who are you?" He asked, kind of in a disgusted voice.
"Silencio." I said, waving my wand. Just then, his mouth was sealed shut and nothing came out of his mouth. Of course, he started crying and his mother and father came down to calm him.
"What did you do to him?"
"Silencing charm." I said. "No big--"
"That's enough!" The man said, standing up. Everyone went quiet. Even the crying kid stopped sobbing.
"MAGIC. DOESN'T. EXIST."
I waved my wand. "Cruci--"
"DOMINO!" Hagrid said, stopping me. "No torture spells, those are illegal. How do ya even know that?"
"T-tortue spells?" The woman stuttered, then fainted.
Harry laughed and high-fived me.
