I cannot believe I got my picture taken with Jeff Gordon in Victory Lane! We did the hat dance with the Monster Mile trophy and after that individual people were getting their picture with Jeff and the trophy. Chase told me to hang around a bit so I could get a picture with Jeff!"Thank you so much. This really has been the best day ever." I smiled up at him as we walked away from Victory Lane. "No problem at all princess." For a few minutes all you heard was the sound of tools clanking, people chatting, and a slightly banging noise from people were breaking down the pit boxes. "So," Chase said. "I heard I heard I'm staying here for the week?""Yeah, your mom got all excited that you had an off week and then your mom and my mom talked a bit. So news is your mom, dad and you are staying the week at my house. We have like four guest bedrooms so it's not a big deal.""Oh well that's super cool. I do hate to say it but aren't you still in school?" "Yeah, my last day is this Friday but Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday afternoon I have the last performances of my high school's spring musical.""Ahh""You don't have to come. It's kinda dumb. It's basically someone took the ugly duckling and made it into a musical.""I know my mom is coming."What was that supposed to mean..? I brushed it off and continued, "Anyway, I thought since my high school lets out ever day at two that we, meaning you, your mom, your dad and myself could go around town. Well, all the little towns that my school is in, the town where I live, the little town my friends live in ya know..?"He smiled down at me, kissed my nose, "Yeah! That sounds fun!"
