"So, you going to Jake's?" I felt an arm getting wrapped around my waist amd I was pulled to a large chest, "Let me go, Simon" I turned aroimd and looked at his eyes, the eyes I fell for, "Are you? Did you get this low? Going to his house ? Does Karam actually know?" He raised en eyebrow, "What do you want Simon?" I pushed him, "Don't go, or I'll tell Karam about everything" He threatened, "Why do you even care? You dumped me, and now you're jealous?" I chucklef amd he let out a loud laugh, "No, I just don't want you to have fun" ....
After a moment of silence, "Screw you, I'm going and you can say whatever you want and tell Karam, because I DO NOT CARE, I won't let you ruim my happiness" His eyes scanned me from head to toe "You call this happiness?".
I was lost, being lost doesnt only mean not knowing where to go, it also means not knowimg who you are anymore.
I was standing on the step of Jake's door, it didn't feel well, I wasn't supposed to accept. Something was wrong. I was standing in front of an old house, no trees, no dog, no fence, it didn't seem like a place that a rich boy like Jake would be living in. I called Jake, "Are you sure you gave me the right adress?" As I finished the line, he opened the door, "Come in" He smiled, I wasn't stupid, I had never been stupid, I could clearly see that it was a fake smile.
As I got in, I heard heard a cough, "Is there anybody here?" I asked, "It's just my grandfather, this is his house amd I had to come take care of him" I wasnt stupid to believe him but I hoped that he was tellimg the truth. Dirt was almost covering everything, I heard a laugh, "You told me it's your grandfather" Fear got into my veins, it did as soon as I stepped into this house, "Yeh, my grandfather or my grandmother, who cares?" Pulled me to him, "I won the bet, I told you she'd come" Two young men came out of a room and headed toward us, "Got the ropes?" The first one said, "Of course" and I saw a dirty smirk cross his face, "Jake, what's going on?" I started shaking."OH, we're just going to have fun" fun, he said ...At that moment, I forgot every Karate move I had learnt in my life ...
I should have listened to Simon ... Oh, I wish I did.....
