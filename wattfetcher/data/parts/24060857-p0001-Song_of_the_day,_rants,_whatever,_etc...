Well, my first song of the day goes to Legacy by Memphis May Fire.
"Chances to move mountains are few and far between,
But only unseen by those who choose them to be
Live every day like it's your last chance to be heard and seen,
Because the good die young and the great change the course of history
Stop blending in and start speaking out!
You'll never know what you can do if you don't try now
Lift up your eyes discouraged one
Keep moving forward until your battles have been won
They say you were created to do great things,
But words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in
Start speaking out!
Don't miss your opportunity
Do you have the courage to follow your heart?
Your life could be over before you ever had a chance to start
Take what you can get while you can get it
And don't let anybody stand in your way
If you've got what it takes, make them believe it
They need to hear you from a mile away!
They say you were created to do great things,
But words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in
Start speaking out!
Don't miss your opportunity
Lift up your eyes discouraged one.
When you feel like giving up,
When they say it can't be done
It's up to you to show them why they're wrong
Lift up your eyes discouraged one.
When you feel like giving up,
When they say it can't be done
It's up to you to show them why they're wrong
Lift up your eyes discouraged one.
When you feel like giving up,
When they say it can't be done
Show them they're wrong!
What you do is up to you.
Follow your heart and you will never lose
They say you were created to do great things,
But words only come to life when you believe!
You were created to do great things,
But words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in
Start speaking out!
Don't miss your opportunity
Reach for the sky!
Nothing's impossible when you realize the strength is inside
Embrace the struggle when it's all you can see
Words only come to life when you believe."
Why this song? I guess I needed something more powerful since I've been listening to very calm and soft songs all week.
