Jordan gives good advice sometimes, well, all the time. "Lifes not poker"And he's right (again)."You don't cash out""You give up and lose all your money and disappoint the ones you promised something"
I guess he's a smart tree.
I watched him die again tonight. The same way as last time. Practically the same dream. I shouldn't have bothered him with it. Just. His death is so realistic. The look of disappointment on his face hurts.
But it's better than dreaming about her. I probably would've ripped my hair out if that happened again. Sometimes I wish she had a grave. But idk. I guess people like cremation.Hell, I don't even remember her last name. That's how hard I tried to forget her. I was doing pretty good until recently.
It's like the better I get on my own the more memories high ash fuck scrapes up. Maybe he's testing how well I can do on my own. I guess that answer to that is "not very well at all".
But hey, it's all just scar tissue.
I can't get past it.
