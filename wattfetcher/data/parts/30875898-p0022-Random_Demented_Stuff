Dear anyone who cares enough to read,
I can't talk, they're listening.
I can't tell you anything, they'll hear.
I try to run away, but they always find me again.
They try to control me, they stalk my every move.
They hurt me, they try to make me do things.
Things I don't want to do.
I'm not lying, why won't anyone believe me.
They won't stop, I don't know what to do.
There are only two choices, I die or they die.
And they can't die unless I die first.
They changed me, they made me break.
I don't cry, I get mad, I almost...
I almost... did something so horrible.
They're everywhere, they won't stop.
THEY NEVER WIL!!!!!!
Help, A Truly Disturbed Monster
