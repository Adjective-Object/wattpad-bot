My World...
In my world, I'm always loney. It's always gloomy in my world, always black and gray, so depressing. There isn't any light in my world. That way I never have to look at myself, my disgusting self. Everything in my world can hurt me, everything in my world does hurt me.
In my world, there are horrors beyond your imagination. All of my faults and short comings follow me everywhere. There is never a sun, a moon, or even stars, just rain, freezing cold rain.
In my world, love isn't a thing, everyone hates me. They all think I'm disgusting, gross, and wrong. Sometimes I feel the same way. No one in my world would care if I died, they'd be happy. Everyone in my world would smile, cheer, and throw a party if I died.
That's why, in my world, the buildings are the highest. The razors are the sharpest. The ropes are the strongest. The guns are the most accurate. The people are the most cruel.
That way, in my world, there's always a reason to die, and it's never just in my mind.
