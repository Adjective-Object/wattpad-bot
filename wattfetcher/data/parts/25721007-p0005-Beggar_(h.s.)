"Please. Go," he pushed and I obeyed. And started to walk away, "Its the second door on your left."
I entered the bathroom. I carefully sat my clothes down on the floor, not sure what to do with them. And I turned on the shower water till it was warm.
I haven't took one for three years. Yeah, it's pretty bad.
I stepped into the steamy shower. It felt so good to actually be clean again. The small beads of water ran down my backside. I washed my hair, first, with shampoo and conditioner. Then I washed my body, removing all the dirt and filth built up from years past.
It felt so good, I almost didn't get out, but I did anyway. I dried off with a towel then wrapped myself in it. There were no other clothes for me in here.
They were still arguing so I went to Zayn and tapped on his shoulder. I whispered, "I don't have any clothes."
"Come with me," Zayn whispered back. I didn't realize everyone stopped talking and looked at me. I guess I look different now that I'm clean.
I followed Zayn into a bedroom and he handed me some clothes, "Here. Wear these."
"Okay," I smiled and he stepped back out of the room to give me privacy.
I wore a black v-neck with dark blue skinny jeans. It felt nice to wear something different for once. I entered the living room again and of course, all eyes were on me like last time.
"Um hi," I giggled. Everyone's eyes went wide. Even Harry's, well, before he noticed me watching him.
"She's even uglier than before," Harry said and I frowned. Why is he being so rude now?
"What the fuck is your problem? Why must you continue to make rude comments? I have done nothing to you. And from what I heard, I'm pretty sure your the friend that Niall was talking about who wanted to give me food everyday. I just don't get it," I managed to shout in one breath.
"Get the fuck out of here," he yelled back. I glared at him.
"You have no right to yell at me like that!" I hissed.
"Yes I do. Leave!"
And I did exactly that. I can't continue to be here if every time I see Harry he's going to make horrible remarks about me. I walked out of the apartment, slamming the door.
I walked past the other apartment rooms and then ran down the stairs leading to the lobby. As soon as I reached the outside, Zayn spoke behind me, "Lennon.."
"What Zayn?" I asked harshly.
"Don't listen to Harry," he sighed. Why would I?
"I'm not," I huffed. I just can't stand how mean he is.
"He's just confused, okay?"
"What are you talking about?" I curiously asked. What could Harry be confused about? There's no reason.
"Long story, you'll hopefully find out someday,"
"Hopefully someday?" I laughed at how pathetic that was. If they want me to stay, I need a better reason.
"You know Harry doesn't even live with us, he has his own frat at the campus,"
"Oh.." I trailed off. So they're all college students?
"He's only around on weekends usually," Zayn said, "Just please come back in."
"Fine," I gave in and walked back upstairs with him.
