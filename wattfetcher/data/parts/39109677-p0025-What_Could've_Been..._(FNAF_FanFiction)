(A/N)...Okay, so the last one was kinda a cliffhanger, I'm sorry but hopefully I can get this one up soon! I know it's short but bear with me, I'm just now getting over an EXTREME case of LÃ¨ Writers Block. The next one will hopefully be way longer and funnier!

I opened my eyes, and a blinding white light took hold of them.
"Thank goodness!" someone shouted.
"You're finally awake!" another one shouted.
"We were so worried! Why would you hurt yourself like that?"
I groaned as the white light faded away. I was surrounded by my friends, Bonnie, Foxy, Chica, Freddy and Goldie. As soon as I came fully into consciousness, I looked around.
I was in my bedroom, laid out on my bed. I wondered why, and all the memories of what happened flooded my mind. I almost died...
"I was so worried," Goldie fretted, enveloping me in a hug.
I coughed and looked down at myself, I seemed paler for one, and there were huge bandages wrapped around my hands. I propped myself up and sat, fully aware of the stares from my friends. I gave them a look that said, what?
"You...Talked to me right before you passed out..." Goldie began, and I nodded, "We were...sorta hoping you would talk again..."
I frowned and gazed down at the red-stained sheets. Should I try again?
I decided on it. I cleared my throat, and attempted to speak. At first, only a few scratchy sounds came out, like creaking, rusty machinery. Then... Nothing. My friends looked down in disappointment.
I tried again. This has to work!
"I-i-it's......o....k-kay," I rasped, my voice sounding rusty and torn.
Everyone looked up at me, huge grins plastered on their faces.
"You... TALKED!!!" Bonnie exclaimed, enveloping me in a huge hug. I nodded, and Bonnie parted from me, giving me a weird look. I gave him one back that said, "What?" and he looked at me with a new look. This time I could read it, it was saying I was a loon.
"We...just want you to talk more..." Goldie explained, his voice heavy, "You should get to talk again...it's not something that should've been taken away from you like it was..."
He sounded genuinely concerned and the emotion touched me. I was still not used to being treated with such care.
I looked around and reached through my friends to my bedside table. It was right where I'd left it...

Guys, I know I can talk again, but it's still a little weird for me doing it...I'll talk a little but I'm not gonna be going all chatty on you for a while.

My friends stared at me for a bit then nodded, they understood. I reached again to put the board back on the table and this time my friends let me through to do it.
When they cleared I got a good look at my table as I set my board down. I glanced at the alarm clock as I withdrew my hand. Holy shit! I mentally cussed, it's 10... SUNDAY NIGHT?!
My friends seemed to notice the shock evident on my face and Freddy stepped forward to explain.
"You had a lot of blood bloss, Karma. We got here just as soon as Goldie called out after you spoke and tried to take you to a hospital. They wouldn't let you in, however, seeing as the whole town seems to be out to get you. We took you back here and bandaged you up as best as we could, but you were knocked out for a pretty long time."
I sighed and picked up the board again, writing,

DO YOU NOT GET WHAT THIS MEANS?! SCHOOL IS TOMORROW!

My friends gave me that weird look again, then realization hit their faces. They all said goodbye quickly and rushed to get their stuff, thanking me once more for inviting them over on the way out.
I sighed as I closed the door behind them, schools gonna be interesting tomorrow...
