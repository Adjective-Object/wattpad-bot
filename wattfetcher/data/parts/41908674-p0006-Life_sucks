A/N: Hey guys just to let you know this maybe a short chapter. but hey don't complain if it is.
Rosa pov.My dream was so awkward but i remember the whole thing.
THE DREAM:I was back at school  and I was  in the middle of  a circle of mine and Christina's friends and Christina was also in the middle. Oh no we are about to fight. Christina sneered at me then went for a punch but I dodged it. For Christina and I take a Material Arts on a tuesday night. Which means that this isn't gonna be a short and easy fight. She punched again this time she made contact with my face and hit my cheek. I kicked her in the stomach which made her double over then I kicked Christina again this time hard in the head with all my force and energy as I did my special spin kick and she went stumbling backwards but after a few minutes she was up again and charged at me. I back flipped out of the way before she tried to punch me again then I punched her in the nose and Kicked her in the mouth and eye. I put her in a head lock but she managed to breack free. As soo as she was standing she grabbed my neck and strangled me then i woke up screaming my head off.So yeah I woke Jazz up and my brother Luke by accident. I told them I was fine it was just a nightmare and to go back to bed. But Luke wouldn't go back to sleep until i was a sleep. Which was annoying. But I listened to him or he would never leave.
So that was awkward. What did you think of that guys. scary? Yea I agree. anyway i have to go do stuff now i'll update soon. bye.xxxxx
