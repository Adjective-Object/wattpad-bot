We both walked towards her. Her head was down. I placed my hand on her shoulder. "______,  what happened? Are you okay?" I asked her.
She was silent for a while. Then, she spoke in a very low voice.
"I'm sorry."
England and I looked at each other with puzzled expressions.
"______, love. What are you sorry for?" England asked.
She shook her head and then spoke again. This time, her tone suddenly changed back to how it normally was. "N-No...  I... I didn't go to the piano room. I'm sorry if I didn't follow you, England. It was... I was...uhm, scared... Sorry for being a burden."
Our faces suddenly soften at her statement.
I backed off a bit as England went up to her and cupped her face. He made her face us. She was really pale and her eyes were watery.
England sighed.
"Everyone here is just as scared, _____. Don't worry. We understand that you were scared of the monster. What scares us more, though, is whether you're safe or not. We're gentlemen here. We'd never let a lady such as yourself walk alone in this dangerous house. We'll protect you and we assure you that we'll get you out of here. All of us will get out of here, alright?" He said in a soothing manner.
I've never seen England act this way before. It's rather reassuring. I saw _____ eyes brighten up a bit after hearing those words. She still seemed so fragile, though. I want to say something, too...
I walked up to them and took _____'s hand. I smiled and spoke, "England's right. You shouldn't worry, we're here. And don't think you're a burden. You're far from it! You always did something to help at all the right times. You even went to get England when you saw me unconscious. I'm very thankful for that."
She looked at me and a small smile formed on her lips. Then, she turned to England, who nodded in agreement with my words.
_____ took a deep breath and spoke once more.
"Thank...Thank you so much."

"--and by breaking the clocks, we adjust the time... so it is imperative that we do this.
We have broken the clocks on the 2nd and1st floor. Now, only this floor and the one above are left." The Japanese man explained.
Italy suddenly piped up. "We found this weird scrap of paper. And then we found a safe inside a room in the kitchen."
"A safe? Maybe the numbers on the keyboard...could be some kind of hint?" Canada questioned.
Russia nodded. "Yeah, then we can open the safe and make some progress. So, first of all... shouldn't we take a look at the scrap of paper that Italy found?"
England snapped his fingers and spoke. "Yeah, they're a perfect match.Try sticking them together."
As the others were discussing about the papers, the tall, Russian man suddenly noticed the girl beside him. He turned to her and spoke, "Hey, _____...."
The girl turned to face him and asked nervously, "Y-Yes...?"
