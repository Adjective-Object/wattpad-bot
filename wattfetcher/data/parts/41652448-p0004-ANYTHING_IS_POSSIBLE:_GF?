Mabel's P.O.V

after I shared my new match made couple to everyone, they got upset at me, and of course so did Dipper. He still likes Wendy. But oh no. He's wearing a v-neck. Those things are stupid.

Mabel: by the way, you are not pulling of the V-neck

Dipper: *sigh* I know.

Mabel: BURN IT!

Just then I saw two people get up from behind something. One had long wavy dark brown hair, was wearing a pink blouse a blue skirt and a necklace with a blue gem. The other one had long dirty blond hair, was wearing a red t-shirt and purple jeans, and she had a necklace with a purple gem. I swear I she looked a lot like Pacifica or Wendy. I called to them. I can tell they got a bit startled.

Mabel: HI!

Mackenzie's P.O.V

i gave up and just decided to introduce myself and Zoe.

Mackenzie: hi I'm Mackenzie *then I started to point to zoe* and this is my friend Zoe.

Mabel: hi I'm Mabel, and this is my twin brother Dipper. Why were you guys hidING?

I didn't want to do anything to mess up the show, so I had to lie and pretend we were part of it.

Mackenzie: we were hiding from... Um...

I couldn't think of anything so Zoe finished for me

Zoe: we were hiding from that weird old man.

Mabel: weird like crazy or weird like strange?

Zoe: weird like crazy

Mabel: oh then you must mean old man McGucket.

Zoe: um y-yeah.

Dipper: were are you guys headed?

we had no where to go, *sigh*

Mackenzie: to be honest, we have no where to go.

Mabel gave a "should we?" look to Dipper. He nodded.

Mabel: if you guys are ok with it, you could stay with us at the mystery shack.

I gave Zoe the same look Mabel gave Dipper the "should we?" Looks. She nodded.

Mackenzie: *sigh* sure. Thanks for the offer.
