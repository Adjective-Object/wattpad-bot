And at that, Italy, Germany, (Name), and America were transported back to their original time, the current time loop.

Just when Past England thought he was finally alone, Past America entered the piano room.

"I haven't seen this room yet. Italy told us not to come here-?! England! What are you doing?!" Past America exclaimed, running down the room to Past England's side.
Past England weakly turned to face him. "Oh...it's...you...This whole room is going to blow up in 30 seconds...You've got to run." he warned. By that time, he wasn't able to hold himself up anymore.

"England!!" Past America shouted as he caught the Brit before he fell.

Past England just stared at him in silence.
Looking at the Brit's state, Past America began to panic inside. "What the hell are those wounds?! It's no use struggling! In 30 seconds, he said...Even if I take him out into the hallway, that thing will just come after us...And attack the other..."
He took a deep breath and met Past England's gaze. "...--I'll stay by your side. A hero could never forsake anyone."
"...Idiot...fucking...show off..." Past England choked out.

The piano room began to shake violently and glow red, signalling that it was indeed about to blow up soon.

Past America smiled weakly. "Only this time, yeah, you're right."

In a flash, America, Germany, Italy, and (Name) were transported in the hallway were Japan, Prussia and Romano were. They were finally back to their original time loop.

"Woah! A-America?! (Name)-chan?!" Japan exclaimed in surprise.

Prussia walked over to his younger brother. "West! What the hell, you really came back!"

"Are you hurt, Veneziano?!" Romano asked.
Italy nodded in reply to his brother. He suddenly saw a certain American walk over to the wall unsteadily. "America!"
"Hh...h...Hhh~...!!" America began to shake.
Germany stepped closer to the American who seemed to start losing it. "America..."

"SSSSH...SHIIIT!!!" America shouted, punching the wall in front of him.

His action surprised the rest of the people in the hall.
America leaned his head on the wall. "He's fucking kidding me!!" he yelled, tears streaming down his face.

"...Japan, I remembered a few more things." Italy said softly, gaining the attention of the Japanese man.
Japan turned to him nervously,Â  "Y-yes?"
"There was someone else who could make time go back." Italy told them.
