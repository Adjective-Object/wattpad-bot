*Lily's POV*
Oh, screw it. I'm sending this selfie. In the selfie I'm standing on one of the toilets in my school. I was kinda falling in the picture but it was at least high quality.
I went on twitter and instagram and put #SelfiesForNash under both captions. I was extremely tired so I plugged up my phone and fell asleep.
I woke up to the sound of my phone vibrating. I grabbed my phone and my eyes widened. Nash, had rt and faved my tweet and followed me! Are you joking? Holy!
I saw that Hayes had also followed me! THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!
All of a sudden I got a notification that sounded like Snapchat. I checked my phone and my eyes widened.
My screen had the message across the screen: "Hi cutie;)" from THE Hayes Grier. Holy smokes.
I like spazzed out on my bed and then replied. "Hi :)" He soon continued the conversation.
I posted a serious selfie. He quickly said something. "You look beautiful:)" I blushed like crazy. "Not trying to sound creepy but can I have your number?" He asked. "Sure." I gave him my number and soon got a text.
"Is this the beautiful Lily?" I blushed yet again.
I quickly texted him back. This went on for hours. We soon facetimed.
"Hi." I said with a small grin. His beautiful eyes sparkled when he spoke. "Hello, beautiful." This made me blush again.
We talked until we fell asleep, with the facetime call still on.
I honestly don't know what's gonna happen with this book, but please support me !
