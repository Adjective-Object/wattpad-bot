"We don't really know anyone." I replied,playing with the sand.
"How come?" Brown eyes asked looking at Mayra with confusion.
"We're,um,new here so we don't really know anyone yet." Mayra responded,her cheeks flushing in bright red embarrassment.
"Oh well I'm Jack Johnson." Blue eyes said taking a seat across from me.
"And I'm Jack Gilinsky." Brown eyes said sitting across from Mayra.
"Jack and Jack." I stated with a smile.
"Yeah." They replied at the same time.
"What're your names?" Johnson asked looking straight at me.
"I'm Alexandra." I replied looking into his beautiful green eyes.
"I'm Mayra."
"Where are you two from?" Johnson asked looking back and forth between us with his green eyes.
"New York." we both responded with smiles tugging at the end of our lips.
"That's cool." Gilinsky said smiling at Mayra.I saw on the corner of my eye,her cheeks turning into a deep shade of red.
"You ride?" Johnson asked pointing at my penny board.
"Yeah." I responded.
"Cool." he said. "so do we."
I nodded my head.
"You two are cool.Different." Gilinsky said.
"Is being different bad?" Mayra asked with a raised eyebrow.
"No.Its good."
-"Well,they were cute." Mayra said,walking inside the house.
"Yeah.But they probably have girlfriends or something." I said,throwing myself on the sofa with a groan.
"You never know Alex."
