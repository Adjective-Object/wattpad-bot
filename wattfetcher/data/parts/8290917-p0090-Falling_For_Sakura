Alaina snorted. "He wouldn't throw us out. We're his sisters."
Nicolas sighed. "Well, maybe he wouldn't. But who knows? His behavior seems to have changed a lot since we got here. And by the way, I don't suppose you know Dad has given me full control of the family trust."
Alaina gritted her teeth. "Nicolas! You wouldn't! You wouldn't cut off my money. I have a right to it."
"Seeing how fast you spent it, Alaina, your portion will not last very long," he said. "Now then. Do we understand each other? It's a warning, Alaina. I rather like Sakura now."
Alaina couldn't say a word because if what Nicolas had just said was true, then his words were law. She said through gritted teeth, "Come on, Tara!" Then she dragged her adopted sister by the arm and stalked out the door.
Nicolas watched them go and shook his head. They hadn't changed a bit where Sakura was concerned.
