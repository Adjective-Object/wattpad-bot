You got out of the truck and looked into the taxi saw that dark brow curly hair and knew it was him. You ran back to your truck crying, and hitting the steering wheel. You turned on the headlights, they saw it. You got out the car and yelled "WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!" "BITCH! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOUR TALKING TO?!" He said slurring his words. "I THINK I'M TALKING TO A FUCKING LIAR!" You screamed. You were then knocked to the ground. Blood coming from your nose and lip. You did't let that stop you. You swung back and hit him right square in the nose. "YOU BITCH!" He screamed. You were tired of his shit, you were done. You were sick of being called names, being lied to, and being treated like shit. "YOU KNOW WHAT?! I'M DONE WITH YOU! I'M GETTING A DIVORCE! WE'RE THROUGH! FUCK YOU!" You walked away crying. Wiping the blood and tears from your face. You got in the truck and drove off. The song Kim was playing. Just as you were about to turn off the interstate, your car stopped. "Fucking perfect!" You tried calling your sister, no service. "FUCK!" You screamed. You looked around in the car and found some jumper cables. "Thank God!" You got back on the road and drove home. You packed up all your stuff and was heading to go put it in the truck when you fell back. You looked up. It was just your sister. "Ivy!" You exclaimed as you stood up and hugged her. "Rose. Sorry I didn't mean to knock you down. Oh shit! What's that on your eye?" "I'll explain later. Just go put this in the truck and give me 5 minutes." You told her. You went and got your soon-to-be-ex husbands baseball bat. You walked outside to looked at his brand new expensive 2013 Jeep. You smashed the windows, the lights, the side door. You smashed everything on that car. You threw the bat on the snowy ground and ran to the car and looked at your sister and said "Let's go."
