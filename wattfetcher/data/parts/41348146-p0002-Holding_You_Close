"Eh." He said shrugging and smiling at me.
"Can you tell me where the English class is, please?" I ask awkwardly.
"Yeah, um, I'll just show you." He told me.
"Uh, okay." I replied.
The awkwardness is killing me!
We walked to the English classroom and then chose our seats. I sat in the back right corner and he sat two seats in front of me where all his jock friends are. I took out my phone to check the time and saw I still had 5 minutes left before class started so I unlocked my phone and texted my best friend, Stacy.
To: Bæ 🍍Hey I got 5 mins, whats the scoop
To: 🍍 Sierra 🍍Bradley just got dumped by Harley. Shoulda seen it. it was craycray
To: Bæ 🍍No. Freaking. Way. seriously?! they have been dating since 8th grade! that IS crazy!
To: 🍍 Sierra 🍍right!? Apparently he cheated on her with Kenzie. So weird. Maybe it was just a rumor and she believed it because he seemed legit sad and confused.
To: Bæ 🍍aw that's so sad
Then I heard the late bell ring and the teacher walked in seconds later.
"Hello class, and welcome new students!" She said lazily.
To: Bæ 🍍gtg class is starting ttyl
Then I put my phone in my backpack and class brought out my notepad. Once class ended, I was met up yet again with "They Guy".
"Hey! What's your next class? Maybe I have the same one or I can take you there." he told me politely.
"Oh, okay. Um, its History next." I said quietly.
"Awesome, I have History as well." He said as we came to the door. "Ladies first."
"Psh." I said with a giggle and he smirked back, and then we began to walk to History.
"I just realized I haven't introduced myself yet." He said as he stopped walking, causing me to stop too. "Hi, my name is Tyler Miller. Foot ball quarter back. Pleasure to meet you."
"Uh, Hi. I'm Sierra Daniels. Pleasure to meet you as well." I said with a smile and we continued to walk. "Quarter back, huh?"
"Oh yeah." He said bringing up his biceps to show them off, causing my to laugh.
"Oh my. What large arms you have. What large feet you have, what large ears you have. You must be a freak." I said playfully.
"The flower can talk!" He says jokingly.
"Flower? Puh-lease. I'm still waiting to bloom into a Barbie." I say sarcastically.
"Ha. You don't need to. Your perfect the way you are, baby." He says winking at me, causing me to blush.
"Um, don't call me that." I say awkwardly looking at my feet.
"Why, baby?" He asks me as he slips his hand into mine and I quickly take it away from his grip.
Well, that escalated quickly.
"Um. To be quite honest, I shouldn't really have to explain myself to you. You should just respect my wish so don't call me that." I said getting frustrated. But that just caused him to react even more. He stepped in front of me and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me into his scent.
