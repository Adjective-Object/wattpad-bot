" don't make fun of me " I frowned
" just joking " he said smiling at me
" let's go" I said dragging him
" are you forgetting something " he asked raising an eyebrow
" no " I said confused
" are you sure" Justin said looking down at my feet
" oh yeah wait here " I said running to get my shoes
" ok got them now let's go" I said pulling down the stairs
" what's the rush " he said fixing his shirt
" I don't wanna keep dad waiting " I said fixing the back of my shoe then pulling Justin out the door
" I'm driving " Justin said sliding in the drivers seat and putting on his seltbelt
" ok " I said sliding in the passenger seat
" seatbelt" Justin said staring at me
" ok Mr bossy pants" I said putting on my seat belt and signaling for him to go
"Ok who's being bossy now " he said referring to my hand signals
" whatever just go " I said
Then Justin turned on the radio and turned the volume all the way up
" no music focus on the road" I said turning it off
" ok ms bossy pants" he complained
" watch out " I screamed as he swerved the car and almost ran off the road
" thats it pull over at that gas station I'm driving " I yelled
unbuckling my seatbelt and getting out the car and Justin did the same
I climbed in the drivers seat and pushed the seat up and Justin laughed at me from the passenger seat
" how do you find this funny I almost died " I said glaring at him
" I'm not laughing cause of that your just so short " he said laughing even harder
" shut up " I said driving off
He then laughed even harder
" shut up I'm trying to focus on the road " I said
" whatever " he said
Then it went silent for about four minutes
" are we there yet" he asked
" no " I said
" ok " he said
Four more minutes
" are we there yet " he asked
" yes " I said sarcastically
" really " he said excitedly
" no " I yelled
" oh " he said frowning
Five more minutes
" are we there yet " he asked
" yes " I said pulling up in the drive way
" yeah I'm staying in the car have fun " he said
" get out of the car " I yelled a little aggravated
" ok but I'm just nervous " he said
