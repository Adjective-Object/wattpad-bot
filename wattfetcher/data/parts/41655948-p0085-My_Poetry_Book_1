We're on the edge of something good
And I'm already hooked on the drugs you lace your lips with.
You're like cocaine.
Breathtaking poetry
Makes a feeble attempt to describe the magic aura between us.
I've always dreamed of exploring the stars,
But as it turns out, the only galaxy I lose myself in
Lies in the depths of your eyes.
You take me to places I'd never like to leave.
We're as elevating as the music blaring through my headphones.
You whisk me away to the stars.
My whole body feels like it's on Mars.
Tell me that this love is real,
Tell me that your heartbeat is in sync to mine
And that we are a galaxy within itself.
Cuz you see, we're on the edge of something good
Tonight.
