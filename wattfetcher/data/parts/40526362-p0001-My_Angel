Maria P.O.VJason was in his room playing piano and I had walked in the living room to see his toys everywhere."Jason come here now" I yelled at my 4 year old son. He looks like his father you may ask who his dad well it's Jack Johnson yea the famous one. When I told Jack I was pregnant he left and never came back. So now I'm here living with my best friend Mia and her son Maxx. The house isn't big but its good enough. Jason had left all his toy on the floor he knew when I yelled his name he had done something and came into the room. "Yes mommy" he said. "Son how many time must I tell you to put your toys away" I told him. He picked them all up and told me sorry. I had left the to get ready for work I work at a local bakery near my sons school so at anytime I could get him. But since today is Saturday I had matt watch him matt and Nash are the only ones who know about Jason and I plan to keep it that way.(Note:Pretented that kid playing piano is Jason)
