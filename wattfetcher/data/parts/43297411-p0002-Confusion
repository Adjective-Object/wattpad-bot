"Be nice to him, ok?" I asked Jake.
He nodded his head. Jake wasn't to fond of Patrick because he liked me and I liked him. Jake was afraid I would get hurt.
I liked Jake, but as a brother. The only one I had a crush on was Patrick.
The doorbell ran.
When I answered it, Patrick stood there.
"Hey." I leaned up and kissed him as a greeting.
"Come on in! Jakes here." I told Patrick.
"No fighting you two! Got it? Otherwise I'll sick Paige on you!" That scared them. Paige was vicious with these two. She knew that I hated when they fought.
"Ok, I'm going to get changed." I dashed upstairs, throwing on the first pair of shorts and tee shirt I came across. I scrubbed my teeth hard, and went to grab my phone.
When I picked it up, I heard something bash into the wall.
Quickly running downstairs as fast as I could, and saw Jake smashing Patrick into the wall. Patrick punched Jake in the face.
"Stop it! Stop it!" I screamed, running between Jake and Patrick as Jake got ready to punch Patrick.
"Jake, go to the living room, I'm taking Patrick to the Computer room. Stay there until I come see you." I commanded.
Patrick was losing a lot of blood through the head.
"I'm so sorry... I shouldn't have left..." I told him.
He shook his head, then stumbled. I caught him, and he clutched onto me for dear life.
After dragging him to the Computer room, I quickly set him down on the couch.
"Are you ok?" I asked.
No response.
He was swaying, and couldn't talk.
I felt tears well up in my eyes.
"I'm so sorry, ok? Jake shouldn't have done that, you have to stay awake ok? I can't have you passing out. I'm not a nurse, but I know you need to stay awake." I commanded.
"I- dizzy." He said.
"Are you ok to talk?" I demanded.
He nodded. "A little bit."
I nodded. "Alright I'm going to ask you some questions, ok? And you're going to answer honestly. Got it?"
He nodded again.
"Alright, did Jake smash your head into a wall?" I questioned.
"Yes." He said.
"Did you bleed?"
"Yes."
"Are you dizzy?"
"Yes."
"Now, tell me, why were you fighting?" I asked softly.
He sighed. "Well, when y-you went upstairs, J-Jake told me t-to stay away from y-you. He said I w-wasn't good enough f-for you, and th-that he didn't want me to b-break you heart. I t-told him I l-love you too much and I-I would h-hate to see your heart break." He told me.
I gently picked up his head, and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
"Hey, I know you would never hurt me. And I would never hurt you either." I whispered.
