"You gon talk to me?" He asked and I looked up.
"It's too much going on man. My head hurt and I just need for everything with Lau and the baby to be okay," I said and my phone rang. Erin.
"Hey Erin." I said.
"Hey bro. Lauren had the baby yet or she still pushing?" He asked excitedly.
"Erin, man. Have you talked to anybody else?" I asked him.
"Mana before she went into labor why? Don't tell me it was just hicks. I'm on a plane on my way there for some hicks. She gon have to cook for me." He rambled and then laughed.
I sighed. "It was real contractions but, Lauren and the baby." I said and stopped trying to gather what I was gonna say together.
"What's wrong Devin?" He asked with his tone changing a bit.
"Lauren is unconscious. She stopped breathing when she was pushing and she lost a lot of blood." I said slowly.
"No. Devin. No." He cried.
"Yeah, and the baby. He or she wasn't breathing." I said and he cried louder.
"My sister no." He cried more. "Devin she got to be okay. That's my best friend, my sister. She's the first person who excepted me for me and her and the family took me in. This can't be." He said
"I'm sorry Devin. I know it's rough. It's rough for me too." I said.
"Are you okay? How are you?" He asked sniffling.
"As good as I could be at the moment. I feel numb." I said and tears slid from my eyes.
"We got to pray. We got to pray because we can't lose her." He said speaking frantically.
"I know. I've been praying. Everything is gonna be okay. It has to be." I said silently hoping that what I was saying was true it's no possible way that I could live without her.
