Me: Mods. You're breaking the rules by having this thread, and it needs to be closed.
Dumbass: WAHHH. WAHHH. I'm not breaking rules! Can't you read? I didn't leave a link!"
Me: You're still breaking rules. You're directing people to your work. This needs to be closed.
...Which then ends with them PMing me angrily about how I'm a bitch and how I'm stupid and how reporting their thread won't do anything... and then I block them.
Lets get a little more "club specific", shall we?
Let's start with the Improve Your Writing thread, because I hang out there the most.
Refer to this rule, made explicit in the FAC (Find A Critic)
Posting services outside of this discussion will result in it being closed
No posting editor threads outside of this thread. No posting critic threads outside of this thread.
You know how many people break this rule?
Put simply, I find a new post almost every two hours. Let that sink in for a moment. Every. Two. Hours.
What I find laughable is that these "critics" think they can critique stories, yet they can't even read something simple like a list of rules. Talk about daft.
So, in essense, people really need to learn to read the freaking rules before they decide to post anything. Before they decide to even JOIN, really. I'm sick of people polluting this website. I'm trying to help this place become better. But with plagiarizing asshats and underage users... I just don't understand.
That's about all the steam I have for this issue.
