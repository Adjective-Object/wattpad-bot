A: This feels wrong.
I: I know, but Casey would want us to move on, Anthony.
A: I know. Dan is a wonderful kid, but it feels wrong to bring him home and not Casey.
I: Ant, I know this is hard, but we have so much love to share. Dan deserves a good home with us. Yes, he isn't Casey, but he is a beautiful and wonderful child. Give it a bit. He might help us get over loosing her.
A: Okay. I love you <3
I: I love you too <3
