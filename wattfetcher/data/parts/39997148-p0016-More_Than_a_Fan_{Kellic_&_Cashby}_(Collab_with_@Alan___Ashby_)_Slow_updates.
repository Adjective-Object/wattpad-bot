"Yeah, I'm good at all that. I can handle it."
I nodded once more just as Alan came back with three cups and placed them down on the table.
"So what do you think?" He asked.
"I think it'll work."
Kellin grinned, "Really!?"
"Yeah, you got the job or whatever you want to call it."
"Thank you so much! Oh my god you have no idea how great this is!" He said happily and I smiled at him.
"Well I'm glad, now just give me a moment so I can call the guys." I said and stood up making my way out.
"Did you see that Alan?" I heard Kellin say, "I touched Vic Fuentes' hand oh my god!"
I laughed to myself before pulling my phone out and calling Mike.
"Hey!" He said as soon as he answered, "How'd it go?"
"He's hired and a big fan."
"Really?" He asked.
"Mhm."
"That's awesome, so what did you think about him?"
"He's nice, good at math and can work well with people and on his feet."
"Okay, now what did you think about him as a person?"
"He was nice that's it. I don't know him very well. I mean I've just met the kid."
"Well go in there and get to know him then! For all you know he could be a crazy ax murderer or something."
"Okay, okay. What time do I need to be back by? It's our first show of tour tonight."
"Be back at like three." He said.
"Okay then. Bye Mikey." I said and hung up. I tucked my phone back in my pocket and turned back to the door and headed back inside to hear Kellin and Alan fangirling about something.  "What are you two talking about?"
"Nothing!" They both said simultaneously.
"Okay." I said and sat back down.
"So what all do I have to do as the merch manager?" Kellin asked before taking a drink of his coffee.
"Count what we have a merch at the end of the night, sometimes at least. Money counting, dealing with other merch boys and girls. Running the merch table. Simple things that add up as tour goes on." I told him, "By the way you'll be in our tour bus so I'll show you your bunk later."
"Oh cool." He said nodding along then stopped, "Wait! So you're saying I'm going to be spending three months in a tour bus with you and the rest of Pierce The Veil?" He asked wide eyed and I nodded causing him to slump in his seat. "Oh my fucking god."
"I'll  let that sink in."  I said laughing and Alan elbowed him.
"Kells chill out."
"This is Pierce the Veil Alan. Don't tell me to calm down."
"You might want to before you scare him off and he doesn't want you working for him anymore."
"It's fine," I said waving my hand.
"See? He's probably used to it anyways. Besides wouldn't you freak out if you were going to be spending three months with your favorite band?"
"Probably but I'm not so..."
