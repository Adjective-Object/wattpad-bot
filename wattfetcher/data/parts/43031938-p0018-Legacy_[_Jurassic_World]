Keira sat at the lunch table with Lowery resting her chin on the table.
"Shouldn't you be all smiles, it's your anniversary."
"Theo hasn't spoken to me in a few days." she told him.
"Keira, he's a teenager. I didn't speak to my parents for two whole weeks because they didn't let me watch the season finale to Friends."
She raised a brow at him. "I wanted to know what happened!" he said defensively.
"Alright!" she put her hands up in defense.
"Sorry," he said.
"It's okay."
"Anyways, what I mean is, he won't stay mad forever. Give him a week and he'll be back to his usual self."
She smiled. "Dinosaurs are so much easier to raise." she said.
"Did you get something for Owen?" he asked.
"Maybe."

Owen arrived at the Bungalow after dropping Theo off at Zach's home to see Keira outside resting in a hammock with her feet dangling out. He walked over and began to swing it gently. She glanced up at him.
"Hi." she said softly.
"Hi." he leaned down and kissed her on the forehead. "Happy Anniversary." he said.
"Was that today?!" she asked sitting up abruptly. Owen's face dropped.
"You didn't..."
She laughed. "No," she handed him a box. He narrowed his eyes playfully at her. She moved over and allowed him to sit in the hammock.
"What is it?"
"A box." she said. He smiled thinking back to the moment of their engagement. He opened it and saw a watch. But it wasn't just any type of watch. It was a wrist watch but the leather looked like dinosaur skin and the center of the watch looked like a dinosaur eye.
"This is...wow."
"Do you like it?" she asked.
"I love it." he smiled hugging her. He stood up. "Now it's your turn." he said offering a hand to get her out of the hammock. She gave him a curious look but followed him as he walked over to the vehicle.
"Close your eyes." he said.
"I'm not playing this game." she said.
"Close them Grant." he said.
"Well, you haven't called me that in awhile." she said before closing her eyes.
"Hold out your hands."
She extended her arms.
She heard him open the car door and close it. She heard a faint whimpering sound.
"Don't you dare open those eyes." he said.
She squeezed them shut.
"Alright, are you ready?"
"I'm ready." she said.
"Good." he was right in front of her by the sound of his voice. "Spider."
She felt something in her hands as she jumped but it was too heavy to be a spider as she fell over and too fluffy. Her eyes shot open and looked to her arms.
"Oh my..." the dog squirmed in her arms in all attempts to lick her face. "Oh hi!" she let out a cry. The dog's tail wagged. She looked up at Owen who smiled at her.
