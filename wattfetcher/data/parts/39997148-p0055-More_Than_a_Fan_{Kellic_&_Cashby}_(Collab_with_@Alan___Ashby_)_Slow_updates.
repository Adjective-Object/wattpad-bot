"Oh damn, no I hadn't seen it. But well at least now you know that it wasn't huh?" I said looking down at the picture.
"Yeah, I ship it though."
I hummed, "Yeah I knew Austin really liked him, I didn't know Alan felt the same way though."
"Me neither he always told me he didn't."
"Maybe he was just in denial." I said opening the door to the bus. "After you."
"He'd only say he was cute but everytime I asked about him liking him, he was like 'no, no I just got done with one relationship, I'm a single man right now' and then I'd make fun of him or something. Oh and thank you." He said before stepping in and I followed after.
"No problem, and don't make fun of him, I'm the same way as he was." I told him taking a seat in the lounge area.
"He's my best friend, I'll poke fun at him when needed."
"Whatever you say." I said as he took a seat next to me.
"He's my best friend, I got to do what I must."
"Okay you do that an-"
The bus door swung open and the guys all piled in, "Does this mean you two are dating now?" Jaime asked excitedly when he saw us sitting together.
"Um, no."
"Ugh!" He said throwing his hands up, "Fine but don't forget what I told you earlier. And Kellin you're still in trouble for letting him get drunk." He said playfully glaring at Kellin.
"I'm still in trouble?"  Kellin said sighing dramatically.
"Yes, you lost my trust." He told him.
"I'll do my best to gain it back."
"You better." He said as the bus started moving again.
"I will." He said saluting him before turning to me, "Is he always like this?"
"Pretty much," I said. "Why do you think I think it's so gross and weird how we're shipped. I don't know how Jess puts up with him."
"Jess ignores it." He told us.
"I don't blame her." Mike said kicking his feet up on the coffee table, "You're annoying."
"Rude." He said pushing Mike's feet from the table, "No feet on the coffee table."
"You're not my mom." Mike said putting his feet back on the table.
"I am while we are on tour." He said pushing his feet off again.
"Who said?" He retorted and put his feet back on it. I rolled my eyes just one more hour and I'm free.
"I don't know I clean up after you guys, don't I?"
"We all clean up." I said, "We're not total slobs anyways."
"Okay even I know that one's a lie." Kellin said laughing, "How many times has Jaime yelled at everyone for being pigs just this week?"
"Like twice."
"No at least four times a day, he is the mother hen on this tour bus."
"Thank you Kellin, I'm starting to like you again." Jaime said happily as he took Mike's feet off of the table once more before pulling it out of reach so that he couldn't do it again.
Mike groaned, "I was comfy but you ruined it for me."
