I fucking hate you, ice cream. I really do. People force me to eat you and you make me feel horrible about myself.
I swear, I won't eat any ice cream until the last week of July. Or anything sweet.
I haven't got any exercise since Sunday and I didn't even break sweat then... And now we're leaving to Latvia and I can't do shit down there... Fuck I'm going to gain so much weight! I'm the kind of a person who gets fatter without even eating.
We were eating ice cream for the fourth time this week... I got a Belgian waffle qwq
I fucking hated the two girls working in the kiosk. Clean your motherfucking ears and get your shit together...
I know my voice is really low, but you don't have to be little cunts about it. Everybody always makes fun of my voice. My classmates, my teachers, my relatives... Even complete strangers!
But whenever I try to make my voice even a bit brighter, I sound so girly I'm disgusted of myself. That's what happens when I speak English. Goddamnit Iggy... Why do you have to speak like a squirting slut..? Every damn word is pronounced from such a strange... I don't know how to explain. It's like I have to raise my voice and make it all girly, just so I can pronounce clearly. In Finnish everybody is just muttering and growling.
English is almost as bad as Swedish.
I'm so fucking afraid of speaking, because nobody hears me... Or then they do and start copying me. School is the worst. And being at home. That's also why I'm so afraid of Skyping my friends. I never speak on the phone.
It's really hard to keep up the happy and clear voice when I actually speak very low and roughly.
Fuck my life. Fuck my voice. Fuck ice cream. Fuck waffles. Fuck my body. Fuck everything.
