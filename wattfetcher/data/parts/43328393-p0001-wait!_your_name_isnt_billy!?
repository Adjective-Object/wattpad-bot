The mistake was listening to the song 1985 when the gods were bored.And that is how i ended up falling through the space time continuum.Dont ask how cuz i have no idea.One second im listening to my music walking to the throne room and the next im falling through a tunnel in the matter of space and time itsself!Then suddenly im holding a guitar in the garage of some random house looking completely emo!Then a dude with weird hair comes in all like 'hey whyd ya stop!?'"Why ya looking at me like that? Is there something on my face? Wait who are you?""Haha yeah right billy! Come on! I wanna hear the rest!"Note to self. My name is billy. I looked at the guitar and started plucking. Hey! It actually sounds pretty good!"Im the son of rage and loveThe jesus of suberbiaThe bible ifNone of the aboveOn a steady diet ofGet some pop and ridalin....."I trailed off. I know that song. Thalia listened to it all the time! Oh no. They didnt..... Shit! The dam gods sent me back in time and turned me into billy joe armstrong!Good thing thalia downloaded all their songs on my ipod i guess!
