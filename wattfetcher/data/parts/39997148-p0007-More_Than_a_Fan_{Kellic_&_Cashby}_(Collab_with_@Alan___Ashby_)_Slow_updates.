"I thought we were leaving tonight?" I said, "When did the plan change?"
"It has since forever."
"Oh." I said then looked at Alan, "You know who Pierce the Veil is, right?"
"Well yeah, of course I do." He said, "I'm just your photographer, that's what Phil told me, but if I have to do them too that's cool."
"I don't know if they have someone or not, I'll have to ask Vic." I said scratching my head.
"I wouldn't go around Vic right now if I were you." Tino said looking up from his cellphone.
"Why not?" Phil asked sounding mildly curious.
"According to Mike he is in a major mood and not someone to really talk to right now." He informed us.
"God what happened this time? If tour is going to be with him being pissy all the time th-"
"Just shush, tour is tour and we'll have to deal with it."
I rolled my eyes, "Just text him or something to ask about it."
"They're here somewhere why don't you go ask? Â I'm about to call someone." He said putting his phone to his ear and walked out of the bus.
"Okay, okay." I said, "Is anyone gonna come look with me?"
No one said anything.
"I will." Alan said.
I grinned, "Alright let's go find Vic and see what's up."
He smiled and followed me off the bus to look for the moody singer.

"Vic calm down?" Jaime said as I glared at my now ex-girlfriend in disgust.
"Calm down? I can't calm down! She was fucking cheating on me!" I yelled.
"I know but getting pissed off and yelling about it isn't going to get you anywhere!"
I looked over at my best friend, "And what would you do if you found out Jess was sleeping around with the merch manager? Because he is definitely fucking fired!"
"I know, but you have to calm down." He said, "Of Mice and Men are going to be here soon."
I rolled my eyes and the door to the hotel room opened but I ignored whoever it was as I looked at Cara and the Merch Manager Ross. "You." I said pointing to him first, "You're fired, and you." I scoffed looking at her completely disgusted. "It's fucking over."
She looked like she was going to cry, "Vic please don't do this."
"No it's over. Just go." I said and she walked towards me grabbing my arm.
"Baby please, I love you."
"No you don't." I spat ripping my arm from her grasp, "Get the hell away from me."
"Cara I think it'd be best if you and Ross just left now." Jaime said softly and led the two to the door. I looked over and saw Austin and some ginger standing by the door.
"Well that explains why you're all pissy." Austin said walking in with the ginger.
I laughed, "I'm guessing one of the guys warned you?"
"Mike did."
"Oh well who's this?" I asked looking back over at the ginger.
"This is our new photographer, Alan." He said, "And we need to know if you need him or you have one?"
