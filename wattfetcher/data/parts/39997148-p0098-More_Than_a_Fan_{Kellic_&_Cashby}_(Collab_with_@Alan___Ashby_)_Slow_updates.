I laughed, "Come on let's get our food and I have to get back before soundcheck for Of Mice."
"Yeah and I have to get back before my beautiful table gets ruined." He said, "Does Wendy's sound good to you?" He asked me and I nodded.
"Perfect, how is your table going to get ruined?" I asked.
"I left Marcie in charge." He muttered.
"Who?"
"One of the merch girls."
"Oh." I said, "She's bad or something?"
"She's not bad, more like she gets distracted and forgets what she's doing and doesn't keep count or pay attention. Oh god we have to hurry!" I said as we headed to Wendy's, "Just wondering but if she's so... unreliable why is she even on the staff?"
"She's Jaime's cousin."
"That's understandable."
"Yeah she's sweet but not the best worker."
I nodded. Once we got there we ordered quickly and waited before paying and leaving and ate on our way back to the venue.
"So what's it like dating your favorite singer on the face of the planet?" I teased elbowing him.
"Its fucking amazing. He's so sweet and funny. He just lights up my day every time I think about it I just freak out because I'm dating the singer to my favorite band Alan! It's so unreal to me."
"I bet it is. You never shut up about him."
He rolled his eyes, "Oh whatever you don't understand how absolutely amazing he is. And he is the sweetest guy I have ever met."
"Well, I'm glad you're happy."
"Its amazing Als."
"As long as you're happy then so am I."
We smiled at each other and kept walking and talking before we got back to the venue and went inside.
"I'll see you later Kells." I said throwing our trash away.
"Bye Alan." He said before hurrying off to the merch tables screaming about how it was all ruined.
I laughed to myself before sitting down against the wall since the guys weren't here yet.
After about ten more minutes of me just waiting the guys finally arrived.
I stood up and walked over to them smiling.
"How was the interview?"
"Great." Aaron said letting an angry Austin walk past.
"What's wrong with him?"
Aaron rolled his eyes, "He's irritated about something I don't even know. But he's been like this since we left to go to the interview."
"Oh. I'm gonna go talk to him." I said before walking off onto the stage where he was standing, "Baby what's wrong?"
"Nothing, I'm fine." He grumbled.
"No you're not. Aust talk to me what's wrong?"
"Nothing is wrong so just drop it."
"I'm not going to drop it. What's going on with you?"
"Well I don't want to talk about it." He snapped, "Now if you don't mind I need to get ready for soundcheck."
I flinched away from him a little, "Fine be a child and don't talk to me." I said getting up, "I'll just take my stupid pictures then be gone and on the bus."
