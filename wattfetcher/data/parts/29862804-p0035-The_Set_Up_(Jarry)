"Harry, two days ago I met Lily Parker and she told me to stay away from you." As soon as I mentioned staying away from him, his face got pale.
"And there's a message was sent to me yesterday saying the same thing. It must be her." Harry said, quietly.
"Let's go to see her." Harry grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the house, he drove to her house. I pressed the bell button and after few minutes Lily opened. She looked surprised.
"What are you two doing here?" Lily asked rudely.
"You told me to stay away from Harry and now you're warning him to do the same by texting him, what's wrong with you?! Just leaveus alone." I yelled in ager. I wasn't going to yell, but I did.
"Look Jade, I told you to stay away from Harry, but I swear to god that I didn't send him any texts." The way she talked made me belive her, but no maybe she's lying to us. She's trying to convince us that she has no idea about the text.
"Why did you tell her to stay away from me?" Harry asked calmly.
"It's not of your business. Now excuse me, I have to get ready for work." She slammed the door. She's so rude!
"I'm sure that she's the one who texted you." I said angrily.
"We will figure out about it later, let's go now." We both left and went back to my house.
"Jade, I want to tell you some-" Harry's phone rang so he went away to answer it. After few minutes, he came back.
"I have to leave, see you later." Before I could ask him why was he leaving, he shut the door. I really want to know what was he going to say.
