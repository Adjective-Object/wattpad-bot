"Thank you," I said smiling and took a drink of my pop.
"You're welcome." He said just as our food came to the table. Quickly we ate and made conversation before we finished. I paid, of course and then we headed out of the restaurant hand in hand for part two.
"So what's part two?" He asked me.
"A surprise."
"Why can't you just tell me?" He whined.
"Because I said so."
"You're an asshole." He muttered.
"An asshole who is taking you to the best place ever."
"I guess so."
"Oh my god you're Vic Fuentes!"
I looked away from my boyfriend and found like three girls running up to us.
"Oh my." Kellin said quietly.
"Oh my god!" One squealed and smiled big at me, "I can't believe it."
"Hi," I said awkwardly.
"Hi." Another said, "Who is this?" She asked gesturing to Kellin.
"Oh uh this is my boyfriend Kellin." I said smiling and squeezed Kellins hand.
"Boyfriend! Oh my god that's so cute!"
"He's so cute!" Another squealed, "Kellin you're adorable!"
He blushed, "Thank you."
"How long have you been dating? Why haven't you told anyone? Oh my god you need a ship name!"
My eyes went wide at the questions, "Uh do I really have to answer all these questions?"
"Only if you love your fans."
I sighed, "Three weeks and we haven't told anyone because I guess we were keeping it private but after this I know it won't be. And we already have a ship name thanks to the guys. Its Kellic."
"That's perfect!"
"Why were you keeping it private?"
"Its a newer relationship and I just thought we could keep it between him and I for a while."
"Oh- Kellin what's it like dating Vic Fuentes!"
"Oh uh, it's amazing."
"Well tell us more than just that! What's it like holding hands with him- or oh my god! Kissing him?"
"Oh it's a um it's..."
"As fun as this is and it was really cool meeting you but we're actually kind of on a date." I told them trying to save Kellin from anymore awkwardness.
"Oh, sorry, sorry." The one said, "Have fun on your date."
"Vic- take a picture with them." Kellin told me.
I looked at him and he nodded.
"Alright, let's take a few pictures then." I said with a small smile. The girls all smiled at me before we all took pictures  today and they even included Kellin too. Which I thought was adorable. When they finally left Kellin and I started walking along again.
"That was nice." He said swinging our hands.
"Yeah," I said and kissed his cheek. "You're just adorable, have I ever told you that?"
He giggled, "Um I think you've mentioned it once or twice."
"Well I'm just going to say it again, Kellin Quinn you are so fucking adorable."
