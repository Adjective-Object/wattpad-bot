Filler Chapter 3. Suna, Mizu and Shukai pt.2
Last chappy, the straw hats and their friends were waiting for the others to return when they realized that Zoro was missing.
"We're screwed. "
________________° Luffy loves meat °________
"Zoro, you baka! "
"Shishishishi, how did you end up on top a mountain? Zoro, you're stupid. "
"Expected this much from a dumbass Marimo. " Sanji insulted lighting another cigarette.
"What'd ya say?" Zoro asked back.
"Shut up! " Nami shouted slamming their heads together.
"This crew is noisy. " Kid noted.
"Get used to it." Sakura answered.
"Yosh, now that's everyone. Let's go!" Luffy shouted.
_______• Zoro got stuck in a chimney.•________
At the actual beach....
"C'est belle. La plage c'est amusant. C'est troup chaud. " Sakura whispered to herself.
"Yass. Let's go in the water." Aya shouted.
"Bitch. You have devil fruit powers. "Haruka stated holding Aya back. She was silent for a moment....
Then she slapped him.
"That's pretty inconvenient." Ace commented.
"Oi, Nami! Did you bring me to kill me? " Luffy asked.
"YES."
"Just for spilling juice on your map?"
"Yes. "
"Nami is evil." Usopp sighed.
"Why did she even invite us? " Law asked.
"Ask her. " Aya answered.
"No way in hell bitch. " Haruka answered.
*Slap*
_______^ Actual stuff happens now^_____
As they say, when stupidity strikes the innocent, it hits them hard.
Sakura, knowing that Kid was approaching with some weird evil intention ,walked away but forget to tell Aya.
Henceforth,
Kid picked Aya up and sent her straight into the sea. Everyone's reactions was similar to the photo in the Author's note.
"Someone, help me! " Aya screamed ,barely to keep herself above water .
In a flash, some became hysterical. Zoro and Sanji argued. Law almost beat up Kid and Bepo and Haruka went to save her.
AFTER the rescue...
"BAKA, SHE ALMOST DIED!!!!!" Nami scolded bonking Kid
"That was the point. " Kid answered having a side glance at Sakura.
"No more drowning okay? "Ace commanded twitching, flames surrounding him.
"H -Hai. "Everyone answered nervously especially Nami who broke out in a nervous sweat.
___×Sanji is a damn perverted womanizer ×___
"Minna look. A volleyball court. "
"Perfect. At least there's something we can do. " Aya sighed being grateful for fact that she's still alive.
