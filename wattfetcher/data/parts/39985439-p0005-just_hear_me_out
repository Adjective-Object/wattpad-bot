Today was a reallly fun day :3 I got to go visit a university and I bought a lot of pretty flowers. (I love flowers especially roses and lilies) I was glad that didn't go to school cuz I hate physical education and I saw a lot of cure guys :3  I heard some friends talk about the popular game "Charlie Charlie" We tried the game. I did it with them but we couldn't get it to work cuz our pencils would always roll off. I heard that the game is scary and considered "satanic" but it could just be the wind and gravity. So ya that was my day
