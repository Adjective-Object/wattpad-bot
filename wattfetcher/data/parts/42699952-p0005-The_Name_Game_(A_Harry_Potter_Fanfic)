"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW!" The chubby man yelled after his wife collapsed onto the floor. I blinked.
"You'd better relax." Hagrid said, threatening him with an umbrella. He dropped the gun, and Hagrid turned to Harry, now satisfied. "Ah, Harry. Look how big you've gotten. And you've still got yer scar, o'course."
Harry touched his forehead.
"I got this fer ya, too. It might be a little squished, I think I must'a sat on it." Hagrid said, handing Harry a squished birthday cake. Harry smiled and set the cake off to the side. Wait, since when did Hagrid have a cake with him?
"Not to be rude, but who are you?" Harry asked. "She introduced herself. Not formally." He said, looking at me.
"I'm sorry. I'm Rubeus Hagrid, keeper o'keys at Hogwarts, School o'Witchcraft and Wizardry." Hagrid said. Harry stood up and shook his hand.
"Formally, I'm Domino." I said. Harry laughed.
"You already said that."
"Well, we'd better get going." Hagrid said.
"To where?" Harry asked.
"Hogwarts!" I said. "We're gonna tow you off to Hogwarts!"
"And I'm towing both of ya, not just poor Harry." Hagrid said.
The man spoke up in the corner. "No, I don't ink you'll be taking Harry anywhere." He said with a glare.
"We have the right to, sir."
"You have no right to--"
"Yes, he does." The woman said. I didn't know she was conscious this whole time. Her husband stared at her. "Yes, yes... We... We have... A witch in the family. Such a shame, though. They're freaks, that's what they are..."
"My mother was not a freak." Harry said. The woman gave him a glare that could shatter glass. I frowned a little.
Then I heard something... Like... Eating. I looked to the back of the room.
The fat little brat from before was nose-deep into Harry's birthday cake! I silently muttered a spell.
It was hilarious how loud he screamed when he realized there was a pig's tail poking out from his butt. I began laughing, but eventually gave up holding it in as he ran to his parents with a pig tail.
"SHE USED MAGIC!" He squealed, running over to his parents in a sobbing mess. Hagrid stifled a laugh, but then tugged my arm and Harry's quickly so we were out in the rain again. Harry laughed, then I began to laugh too.
I shut up when we were back in the boat. I curled up on the bottom again, murmuring the limerick over and over to myself as we sped along the water. Harry, who was having fun on this little ride (I don't know how that was possible), looked down at me and frowned.
"Are you alright?"
"Freaked out is all."
"Why?" He asked. "Do you not like thunder storms?"
"Please don't laugh." I said quietly.
"Promise you I won't."
"I'm afraid of water."
Harry smiled. "It's okay. We're almost on land, anyways, Domino."
