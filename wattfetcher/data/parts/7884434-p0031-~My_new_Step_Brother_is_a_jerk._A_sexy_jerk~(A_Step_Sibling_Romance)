"Please say something Shea" He said looking deeply into my eyes, his filled with tears.
"Seth I don't know what to say"
"Say you'll forgive me. I'll do anything Shea. I can't live knowing your not mine" He said leaning in. My eyes fluttered closed. I feel his warm breath on my face.
He whispers: "Shea do you still have feelings for me? Will you be mine please?" I shiver at his words. His voice. I'm falling for his trap. I have a bad feeling about this but at the same time it feels so right. "Please be mine" I open my eyes and stare into his beautiful eyes. I can't help but nod my head yes.
A big smile appears on his face and I smile. His face bcomes serious and his eyes mysterious.
"Im falling more and more in love with you Shea" His hand came up and touched my face his thumb carressing my face. I looked into Seths eyes and I got lost in them.
Lost in the feeling of his warm soft hands carressing my skin.
The feeling of being back in his arms that I missed so very much.
The feeling of just him around me.
All of that felt like heaven to me. I was falling in love with him...
Im scared to be completely honest with you. What happens if that girle comes back and tries to steal him away from me. I can't have that.
I won't have that.
"Seth" I said softly
"Yes Shea?"
"Can I ask you something?" I asked
"Anything" He said with a smile.
"Who was that girl?" His smile fell.
"Shea it doesn't matter who she is. What matters is that you are back in my arms. I don't wanna loose you Shea" He said with the most loving look in his eyes. I looked into his beautiful eyes and saw the sincerity. He wasn't lying.
"I just wanna know her name Seth" I said with a smug grin.
"Her name was Ashlee. She was a slut I used to hook up with. I was mad. Im sorry" I put my hand on his cheek and carressed it softly with my hand. His eyes dropped to the floor. He was mad at himself.
"Seth look into my eyes" He looked into my eyes and I smiled. I wrapped my arms around his neck and tangled my fingers in his silky smooth hair. "Kiss me Seth. Show me your sorry"
The sides of his mouth started twitching into a smile as his leaned in and slowly pressed his warm softl lips against mine. The feeling of his ,outh against mine was pure bliss.
I missed this
I missed him
I think I love him...
I do Love Seth. I do.
The warm feeling of him surrounding me made my whole body fill with love and lust. His and my breaths swirling together forming one. His soft warm lips pressed against mine. My fingers tugging and swirling in his hair. His hands wrapped around me pulling me closer to him.
It was perfect.
