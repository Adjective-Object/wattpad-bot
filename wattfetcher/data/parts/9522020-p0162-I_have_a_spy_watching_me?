I was so happy. He had already made our plates and put them in here. My question is how did he do this without me knowing because this looks like it took longer than the few minutes he had done a few seconds ago. I looked at him and he smiled.
"How do you like it?"
"I love it, but this must have took you longer than the time you just had." I said.
"It did. When you went to your room a few times and when I went to go check on the food I did this. I also may have had help from a friend, but don't worry they never came inside your house. Also your brother said that you loved sunflowers so I bought them. The roses were from my parents as they wanted to help give an apology and say that you are welcomed over the house at any time." He said.
"Isn't the pack house opened to everyone?" I asked confused and he chuckled.
"Yes, but we have a house besides the pack house. Usually my parents and Greg stay at the pack house while my sister and I stay at the house. It's our place to blow off steam or just to have silence. My sister and I bond more than my brother and I. Kiera usually does whatever though."
"How is it to have siblings of both gender?" I asked.
"Well, it's nice." He said pulling my chair out helping me scoot in. "I love them all but I get into more fights with my sister and older brother than Kiera."
"Why is that?" I asked him as he sat down.
"Well, first off, she helps me when it comes to girls. Secondly, she tells me what I should and shouldn't do when Mom and Dad gets pissed. Thirdly, she and I always saves each others asses when it comes to trouble and just anything really." He said.
"She's your go to person is what you are saying, right?" He smiled.
"Exactly, she is my go to person." He says as we both start to eat. "Who is your go to person?"
I had to think about that. I don't really talk to a lot of people.
"If I were to be honest with you, it would be my mom, but if I couldn't go to my mom then I would of said that my go to person is my friend, Angelica Daniels. She and I go way back and she's one of the few people I still talk to from middle school and elementary."
"Wow, that's great!" He said.
"Besides family, who else?" I asked him.
"Besides family, it would have to be Justin or Tania, sometimes Jaycie." I nod.
"How long have you known Jaycie?" I asked.
"I've known her since pre-k."
"Wow, I've only known her since the first time my brother first returned home from the first kidnapping." I told him.
"Have you ever been kidnapped by them?" I shook my head no.
"I have not." I said. "Have you?"
"Actually, that was my first time. Talon, Jaycie, and Chase were with me but we were only there for a few hours. Also, if anything, it was worst for Talon and Jaycie. I was merely just there." He said with a frown.
"I'm sorry." I said and he just shook his head no.

I looked at the time and was going to say I should go home but I felt bad. Just as I thought about this Jaycie sent me a text.
