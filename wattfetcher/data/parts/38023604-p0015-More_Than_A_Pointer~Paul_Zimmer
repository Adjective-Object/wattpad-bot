"What is it?"
"I want a kiss!" I touched my cheek as if to explain  myself. Paul shook his head, smiling slightly and sighed playfully.
"Fine, if I have to." He mumbled, jokingly of course.
He quickly kissed my cheek, causing me to chuckle. I leaned in to kiss his cheek and jjust barely grazed it, before he was pulling away.
"Ewwww Melanie germs!" He wiped his face with his hand.
I stuck my tongue out at him. "Shut up or I'll lick you."
This caused him to smirk. "Where?"
I scoffed and smacked his arm. Paul laughed and pulled me back into a hug.
"I'm only playing with you." Then he lowered his voice. "You do know that right?"
"Of course I know that." I stuck my tongue out at him, smiling a bit as I did so.
"See now, I can't exactly kiss you when you're doing that now can I?"
I chuckled, causing my tongue to go back into my mouth. He smiled and kissed me gently.
