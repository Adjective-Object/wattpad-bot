Jack P.O.VI was walking along the the streets and just thinking about 5 years ago I left the girl of my dreams because I was scared yea she was pregnant. I wish I could see what my child looked like. I passed the park seeing couples with there kids and though that could be me and Maria. I remember the day I left.Flash Back (4 years ago)"Maria this can't be I'm not ready for kids and I bets not even mine." I yelled at her. "Really Jack you are my first and only and your gonna deny your child I wish I never met you."Maria yelled at me. Your a worthless slut you either get ride of that thing or I leave. I told her with no emotion she looked down and in a low tone she said leave and I left.End of flash backI went past a bakery and heard a voice I have not heard in forever I knew it was Maria. I walked into the bakery and heard her singing. I smiled and sat in the back so she wouldn't see me. She was singing the song I sang to her when she was with another guy the song was more than this by one direction. She finished singing and I walked up to her she looked at me and ran out. I chased her and grabbed her arm. She looked back and said let go. It old where my child she said she lost him because of me. I looked at her and cryed and said you lost him it was a boy. She looked at me and said yes I let go of her and she ran off.maria P.O.VI lied to him I have to protect my child the one he never wanted. The one he left me with. I cried and went home I texted matt and told him to keep Jason over night. I layed in my bed and cried myself to sleep.(Note:that's maria singing)
