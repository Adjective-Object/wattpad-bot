It kept everything cold really well, which is why I was able to bring stuff like yogurt and sushi, which, consequently, were the components of my lunch. Everyone stared at me as I pulled out my chopsticks and began eating the sushi. I gave them my signature, "What?" look, and they pointed to the chopsticks. I swallowed and mouthed, "So what? I'm eating traditionally!"
Everyone, on cue, laughed and began to make smalltalk, I'd finally found a place where I belonged.

🐠You Most Likely Guessed it! Time Skip~ Wooooo!! (•___•) 🐠

I walked into fourth period, a slight smile on my face. Even though none of my friends were in my after-lunch classes, it was nice just to think about them. I walked to the, (Yes, again) solitary table at the back of the room.
Fourth period was science and instead of having the normal one-seat desks that were moved into groups, we had lab tables. But, even then, I sat alone at mine.
Once I sat down, class started, and I was surprised to hear from the teacher that more new students were coming...odd, our town was really small, it's pretty weird that anyone would wanna move here...
I gasped when the student walked in, it was the same guy I'd bumped into this morning on the way to school. He still had the face makeup on, and his hair was still ruffled and swept to the side, but he'd completely changed his attire. In place of the black jeans and T-shirt he'd been wearing was a knee-length black parka, black combat boots, and a white shirt with a K (Anime show, IS AMAZING!!) logo. I glanced more closely at the shirt, and I couldn't help but notice it had evil Shiro on it, one of my favorite characters. The boy saw me, quickly talked to the teacher, and walked over, setting his stuff down when he reached my table.
"I know I said that I'd like to see you again, but I didn't expect to see you so soon!" he exclaimed, dramatizing for effect. I laughed a little, and the boy sat down. "Mission accomplished," he said, "Sooo, my name's Maurice, but I go by Mari instead, what's your name?"
I pulled out my science notebook and wrote it down.
"Proxis, huh? That's a...unique name," he said, a little fidgety. I laughed a little and Mari eased up a bit.
After about ten minutes of working together, Mari and I grew pretty close. Surprising what dissecting frogs does for a friendship.
The end bell rung, and Mari stood and held out his hand to help me up. "Sooooo," he began, "What's your next class?"
I held out my schedule and he glanced at it.
"Looks like our only other common class is math, in eighth and ninth period," he stated sadly. "So I guess I'll see you then!" he perked up a bit at the thought and I smiled, waving to him as he left.
There's another friend to add to my rapidly growing list...
