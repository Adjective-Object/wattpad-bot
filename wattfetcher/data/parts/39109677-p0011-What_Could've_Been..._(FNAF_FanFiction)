(A/N); Ok, I know no normal person is up this late writing, but I am, so here it is, CHAPTER 7!!


I sighed as Bonnie dragged me down the hallway, he has no idea where he's going... I poked him on the shoulder and he turned around, I pointed the opposite direction, mouthing, "That way!"
Bonnie face palmed, then began dragging me the other direction, I poked him when he neared the end of the hallway and pointed at my locker. Communicating is hard...How do people deal with friends?!
Bonnie stopped and I walked up to my locker, on it in red spray paint were insults of every kind. From freak to bitch, they had it covered in graffiti.
I sighed as Bonnie stared and opened my locker, I reached on the top shelf and brought down a bottle of bleach and a roll of paper towels, I set to work. I scrubbed and scrubbed as Bonnie watched, when about half the graffiti was gone he took the paper towel I was using from my hand and used it himself. That's...sorta sweet...
Bonnie threw the rag away when he was finished and reopened my locker for me. I put all my stuff away and grabbed my lunch-bag.
I blushed and held it at an angle that Bonnie couldn't see. Damn it! My lunchbox is covered in fricking bunnies!
"What're you hiding, Proxis?" Bonnie asked as we set off down the hallway. I mouthed,
"Nothin'..."
"I know that's not true, show me," he insisted, and I gave in. I showed him the lunchbox and he burst out laughing. "That's so damn cute!" he shouted, enveloping me in a sudden hug, "You're so cute!"
I sighed as he released me, and set off down the hallway, Bonnie directly behind me. I stopped at the cafeteria door and walked in, everyone stopped eating to stare at me.
"Look, the freak needs food!"
"Witches need to eat?"
"I thought people like her drank blood for their nourishment."
I kept my head down for all of it, and Bonnie laid his arm protectively around my shoulder.
"It's ok, Proxis, I won't let them hurt you," he whispered to me and I gave the faintest nod.
We made our way to the back of the cafeteria, and I sat at my usual table.
"So you do sit alone..." Bonnie murmured. I nodded.
"I've got an idea!" he suddenly shouted, "I'm gonna go find my friends, I think they'd like you too!" I glanced at him, and saw joy and hope written across his face. "I'll be right back!" he promised, then scurried off to who-knows-where.

✨Ten Lonely Minutes Later✨

Bonnie came rushing back up to me, four people scurrying along behind him. Three I recognized, Foxy, Freddy and Goldie. One was new.
She was shorter than me, which was saying something. She had blond, strait hair that reacher her shoulders and had pinkish-purple eyes. She wore a pretty yellow sundress and white leggings.
She's really pretty... I guess all the new kids really DO come from Models-Vill.
"We've already met her, Bonnie," Goldie said, waving at me.
"Same here," chimed Foxy, gazing at me with a weird look.
