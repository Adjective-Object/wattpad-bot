She Wanted Him To be Here, Celebrate with her. She knew that whatever she'll do, she wont get him off her mind today.. birthday or not.
Damn, Has she fallen that hard ?
"Bree !!" Two Fingers snapped infront of Her eyes, snapping Her out of Her daze effectively.
Shaking Her head lightly, She Stared at the person at Her right sometime before realizing it was non-other than Justin..
Damn, Was She that Whipped ?
He Gave a her One Of His cute childish Grins, Waving his hand infront of her..
"Earth to Bree. "
"Come On, Make a Wish !!" Janice Squealed Out loud Excitedly like it was her own birthday.
Brianna went and stared back at the Perfectly Designed Cake And The Two Candles indicating her sixteenth birthday.
Peeking up at The People around her, Her Gaze Followed each and Every Person Before She Jumped Up Mentally, A Grin Curving Onto Her Lips.
A Wish !
Thats All She Needs !
She Knew How Powerful A Healer's birthday wish can be.. Each Birthday, A Healer Would Be Granted a Wish That Will Most Certainly Be Granted by The Moon Goddess If.. It Wouldnt Affect her The Negative way..
A Healer Was The Closest To The Moon Goddess, Simply Because she Carried half Of her Powers And Wisedom.
That Doesnt Mean She Can Communicate with her As It was Impossible For a Creature To Dream Or Meet Their Goddess..
Her Gaze Flickered Back To The Burning Candles On The Huge Squared-shape Cake As Her Mind Was Rummaging With Thoughts, Contemplating On a Decison to Take.
Suddenly, The Same Extremely Familiar Voice Started Whinning Again In the Background Except This Time, It Seemed To Be Begging..Pleading For Someone..
The Racking Sobs Started getting Louder But Even though, No One Seemed To Hear a Thing..
The Atmosphere Was Silent, As Brianna Slowly Approached The Burning Candles, A Grin Tugging On The Side Of Her Lips.
The Tiny Voice Grew Even Louder, This Time Screaming At Someone, Screaming Incoherant Word Mixed With Sobbing And Weeping..
Finally, Knowing What She Wanted, She Closed her Eyes As She Told Herself Determinly..
'I Could Do This, I Have To Do This..For Him..For Aiken..For...Us.'
Screaming, Wailing, Weeping And Sobbing Filled The Atmosphere Though, No One Seemed To Hear..
They Were All Silent, A Smile Tugging On Each Of Their Lips As They Waited Excitedly For Brianna..
Everything Seemed To Happen In Slow Motion, Almost As If..Someone Was Controlling It..
Finally, Brianna Whispered The Words Mentally In Her Mind, Hoping With Everything In Her Heart, The Moon Goddess Would Grant Her The Wish.
As She Whispered The Words Mentally, Her Eyes Closed Shut, A Blinding Light Appeared Before Her, Making Her Frown Mentally As She Tried Opening it Back..But She Couldnt.
A Silhoutte Of A Woman Appeared Before Her As It Slowly Started Approaching Her Slowly, Though She Couldnt Detect Her Features.
The Woman's Figure Was Almost Similar To A Shadow Of Beautiful Woman With Long Hair Flowing Down Her Back And Flying Around Her Shoulders Aimlessly. The Woman Pace Slowed Down Until she Stood Just Two Feet Away Before Her Hands Reached Out To Brianna.
