"We can do this, okay? We'll do that long distance thing," he suggested, his voice shaking, very panic-like.
"We both know those things don't work out," I whispered, running a hand through my hair. "I'm sorry."
"No, this can't be it," he pleaded. "We can't just end something like this. We had plans and dreams and hopes. This can't be fucking it."
"I know, but we're just sixteen! That's a young age, Luke. We have a lot ahead of both of us. There will be others--"
"Bullshit!" He screamed, letting go of my side. I felt so exposed; his arm was my protection, and now, it was gone.
"Please, don't make this harder than it needs to be," I cried, allowing the tears that built up, flow like a dam. Our fingers laced together, but I couldn't tell which hand was mine and which was his, my vision too blurry to be able to see anything, actually. "There are thousands of girls that love you out there."
"But none of them are you," he sighed.
"You'll forget about me soon enough," I whispered, kissing his hand that held mine. He shook his head, letting go.
"No, I won't," he said, forcefully, standing up.
"Yes, you will," I answered, my voice wavering.
"Do you love me?" He asked. I nodded, the tears falling from my closed eyes. "Then, we can make it, okay? We will last."
-
We didn't.
Four months and thirteen days later, a picture of Luke and a blonde girl kissing surfaced the web.
"Hey, it didn't mean anything, okay? I was just caught up in the moment and drank a little bit too much than I should've," video Luke said. The Skype browser began buffering, making the connection worsen.
"I told you we weren't going to make it," I said, quietly, biting back the tears that threatened to spill. I forced them back, not wanting to cry in front of him. "I don't want to do this anymore, Luke. I'm tired, and I just don't like being in this situation. All this extra shit that has happened these past months has been too much."
"What do you mean?" He asked, his voice shaking. I saw the tears leave, dripping down his face. I rarely saw him cry, which made this moment difficult.
"Luke, we have different time zones. I have to be in the studio, and you're busy, too. Our schedules clash half the time so we can't even talk to each other, and this girl--" I began.
"No, no, come on. We can do this," He explained. "Chloe, please."
"I believe you," was all I said. We sat in silence, the loudest silence I'd ever experienced. I was angry, pissed off, but not with Luke. I was angry with myself; I knew that this was never going to pull through, yet I still hoped and tried to work it out. I wanted to scream and kick something, maybe even burn the whole fucking house down, but in that moment, all I did was cry.
"This is it?" He asked, quietly. I nodded, wiping away the tears with the end of my sleeve.
"There's nothing else to say," I said, giving him the biggest smile I possibly could, which was the smallest one.
"You know what? Fuck this and fuck the world and fuck everyone and fuck you," he screamed, his glossy eyes glued to mine.
