I swung the door open to my dads sitting area, "am, who are you?" Some young woman asked "am, I'm a student, and who are you?" I said giving her a disgusted look, where was the old secretary?
"Am, what do you want?" She said giving a look back at me, I walked up to her desk slowly, "to se the head master," "you can't," I cleared my voice, "and why is that now?" I said raising my eyebrows, "because he seeing me," her words dripped in venom,
"Oh so the head master, my dad," I said dragging out my words, "has to see to you first, her face changed and she nodded at the door, I smirked at her and pushed myself of the desk, I opened the door,
"Seriously," he sighed at my voice, "it isn't my fault, you are late for your next class, we will talk about this some other time," he wrote on a green slip and sent me to the door, "who is the new secretary, she wants you, that ugly slut wouldn't even let me in here she said you had to see to her first," I scoffed, he sighed again and I left, giving the girl a dirty look and went to my English room that was in the same hall,
The teacher was talking shite, i cleared my throat and everyone turned my way, I kept my look in the teacher, he sighed, "and why would you be late to my class?" I handed him the note and I turned to the class,
"The seating is boy girl, miss Johnson, for the rest of the year," I scanned the room for the empty seat, my eyes landed on Rose, who was sitting beside Daniel, God love he- no not him my eyes widened when the only empty seat was beside him, I huffed and strutted down to the seat behind Rose, he didn't even look at me, and I wasn't going to try and get his attention.

"I can't believe we made it to lunch," I said sitting at the the new table we claimed me Catherine and rose, ate are chocolate cookies and pizza, "you have health next, I have geography and you have photography," I sighed why is my life like this?
"Well, just hope I sit beside him," I smiled, rose and Catherine looked at me their eyebrows knitted together, "what," "well you know what we don't hope happened and what we do hope doesn't so," I raised my eyebrows in a 'do you get it now' look, the stifled a laugh.
I got up, "I'm going I don't feel very well," I said my stomach was sore it felt like I was home sick, "okay, do you need any help?" "Nope, I'll be fine," I smiled a thankful smile and was on my way.
I got to the class 5 minutes early, "Emily?" "Mrs Miller," I smiled "so how's the relationship," oh, well it's shit, at that moment someone cleared there throat, "terrible actually," I said pretending I didn't notice, the devil himself behind me,
"He cheated on me, i guess I was another one of his games, you know the one he played with all the other girls in town," I smiled and took a seat, Mrs Miller had her mouth hanging open and looking between me and mark, "you know what," I heard an angry voice say close to my ear,
I was lifted of my feet and turned around, apparently Mrs Miller left, walk in please, someone walk in, "Mark and Emily are already in," I heard Mrs millers voice from the door and he quickly let me go and dat in the seat beside me,
My eyes were wide, and I didn't know what to do, literally my mouth was hanging open, my dad walked in and took one look and walked back out

"Okay, I'm Mrs Miller, your new health and social teacher for some," she smiled, "today we are going to start in what a healthy relationship means and how it effects our health," I rolled my eyes and sighed moving as far away from him, he kept looking at me from the corner of his eye, "okay so how do you feel when you break up?" Mrs Miller asked, the first person to put their and up was Mark, "okay, Mr Rider," "why won't you let me explain? I don't love her I love you I only have eyes for one girl and that's you," he smirked and looked at me, I blushed a little.
