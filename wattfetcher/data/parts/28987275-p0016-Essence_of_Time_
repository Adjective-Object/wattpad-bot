She smiled to the crowd, and they clapped. Geez, it didn't take much to please these people.
She stepped into the center of the stage. "Hello. My name is Moira Swanson, and this is my assistant, Skippy. I hope you have all had a wonderful day so far. And I do hope you're ready for it to become even more wonderful!"
