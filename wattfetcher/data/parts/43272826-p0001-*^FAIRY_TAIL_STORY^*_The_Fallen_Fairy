*Chene's POV*
Hi. My names Chene. I was in Fairy Tail back when Mavis was master. I used Requip Magic and was the strongest in the guild. I even surpassed Mavis. I died, but I wasn't buried. No one even found my body. That's because I turned into a ghost that no one could see, and I couldn't do anything. Whenever I tried to call for help no one would turn around and answer my calls. And when I went to move something my hands would just go through things.
I suffered this for many years and time went by slower than usual. When I went back to Fairy Tail they even had a new master!
But one day after years and months and days and hours and minutes and seconds everything changed.
