"Yeah, that must be terrible." Luffy answered, picking his nose.
"You have no idea." Aya and Sakura answered, sighing in unison.
"Alright, I know what I can do. What happens afterwards only pertains to you." Aya warned.
"Yes! Come on Aya, let's go!"
"I feel so sorry for myself."
"Girl, i feel your pain."

Another time skip.....

Aya walked up to table which was occupied by Kid and Killer.
"Hey Killer!"Aya exclaimed, waving her hands and walking up to the table. Kid merely glanced at her before scoffing.

Aya, though being innocent, was a reason why most  of the boys ended up in the infirmary only to be treated by Law or Chopper instead of her. Most of the boys say that her beauty was on pa with the Pirate Empress. Whether, this is true or not, no one would ever know although it didn't make that much of a difference to Kid or Haruka.
"How has it been?" Aya asked smiling. Even behind the mask one could tell that Killer was going through a rainbow of emotions.
"Who's that?" Kid asked not even bothering to look at the girl.
"My name is Nurse Aya and you tried to drown me once." Aya introduced with a cute puffed-up face.
"Oh really?"
"Don't 'oh really' me!" Aya exclaimed, steaming with anger.
"Tch, bipolar bitch." Kid answered. Aya raised an already steaming fist when Killer cam between the two.
"I am sorry for my captain's idiocy but is there something you need?"
"Yes, I need to talk to you for a while." Aya said looking down.
"Yes, Kid, I will be back."
"Alright."

Aya smirked. It was all going according to plan. Luffy and Sakura were already in their positions, Luffy waving his Sharpie Markers in the air.
Behind her back, she had already made a small, blue glitter ball.

Aya: Surīpubōru. (Sleep ball)

She then threw the ball at Kid who immediately fell asleep.
"What was that for?" Killer asked.
"Revenge." Aya answered cutely. She then winked Sakura and went to talk to Killer about some random topic.

Sakura and Luffy appeared from behind the sleeping Kid.
"You ready, Luffy? We only have 5 minutes." Sakura reminded him.
"Yeah, its Sharpie Time!" Luffy shouted. Afterwards, Sakura tackled him to the ground.
"Shut up! Not because he is sleeping doesn't mean others can hear you, you know?" Sakura told him, trying to close his mouth.
"What the hell are you two doing?" Ace asked looking at the weird positions, she and Luffy found themselves in today.
"You! oh la fermer et de foutre, Portgas. Pardon my french." Sakura shouted, first to Ace then to Aya who was ready to slap her.
