"Before I say anything, I have a favour to ask of you. You see, there's a box inside the cell,isn't there?" Italy asked, pointing at the wooden box on the other side.
China nodded. "Yeah. That one, right? What about it?"
Italy gave a small smile. "Can you open it for me? I can't open it, and I want to see what's inside."
"Then I, the hero, will open it!" America announced, walking inside the cell.
China and France followed him, curious about the box, as well.
Prussia turned to Italy and asked, "What's in that box?"
"Errr... Hope?" Italy answered nervously.
Canada furrowed his  brows. He went over to the others to check.
"Huh?! What the hell?! It won't open at all!" America exclaimed.
England rolled his eyes and walked over to America. "You're pathetic. Give me that."
"Maybe it's locked?" Russia suggested, following England.
"Let me try." Germany said.
Before Germany could go inside the cell, Italy grabbed his sleeve. "Germany."
"What is it?" the burly man asked.
While the two were conversing, Japan went inside the cell.
"You just found something, didn't you? Maybe it's some kind of clue. Can I take a look?" Italy asked him.
Germany took the metal object out of his pocket and showed it to the Italian. "You mean this? I don't think it's much, but...oh, well...", he said as he handed it over to him.

With that, he locked the rest of the nations up inside the iron cell, surprising everyone.
"Hey, America, why don't you say it?" Italy faced the blonde haired American on the other side.
"... Italy!!" America called after him.
Italy looked at him dead in the eye and spoke bitterly, "Say it. In front of everyone. Who lured them here?"
"What are you talking about?!" China asked, confused of what's happening.
Russia spoke, "America?"
"By the way, there's nothing in that box. It's just an empty box. Sorry." Italy apologised.
Canada shook his head. "It can't be...What's the meaning of this?!"
"Hey, America, what's going on here? What are you hiding?!" England demanded.
"......Huh? Aren't you going to say it? Why not? Read the atmosphere for once!" Italy told him with a disappointed look on his face.
"Italy!!
Open this door!!!" Germany ordered.
Italy pouted. "Aww, but if I open it, you'll get mad at me. Then again, you already are."
Germany clicked his tongue. "Son of a--"
Prussia tried to hold back his younger brother, then turned to the man on the other side of the cell, "Italy..."
