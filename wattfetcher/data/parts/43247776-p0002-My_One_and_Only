Around 5:00 back at Maya's house
"Lilly, what do you know about the Dark Storm Pack." I say out loud while we sit in my room on the floor. Lilly gives me a strange look like I said I was a butterfly.
"Why do you want to know?" she asks me concerned
"Just curious" I shrug
She sighs, "You know curiosity killed the cat"
"True... but the cat had nine lives." I say smiling. she rolls her eyes at me and laughs.
"Well, I know that they are probably the scariest pack in North America and the Alphas name is Tyler and he got the position by challenging his father for it and he won." She tells me and awaits my reaction.
"Tyler..." I test the name out on my name and I could feel my wolf come forward slightly.
"Yes that is his name...and I heard he is the most ruthless and cruel alpha out there." I just sat there and did not respond as I thought to myself and processed the new information.
"Maya I know you have been wanting to go to a pack meeting but why would you want to the upcoming meeting, you know it is just with our pack and the Dark Storms."
"I know Lilly but I don't know I feel ready enough and I want to meet new packs so why not be this one?"
" You have a good point, if anyone could handle themselves at that meeting, it would be you" she turns to me with a smile.
I stand up and give her a hug, "Thanks Boo"
" I should get back to my house for dinner, I will talk to my father if I can about the meeting"
" Ok I will talk to you later then." I walk her down the stairs and to the door before I head back to the kitchen to help dad with dinner.
