PLEASE READ AS THIS IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY MORE CLEARLY CAUSE THAT SUMMARY WAS AWFUL...
I just wanted to make the summary more clear. I am going to be writing about what happens to Ezra while he is with the Ghost crew. Like his love life, troubles he faces, trust issues, missions, all that good stuff. Also to the experienced writers, like the ones who write here on wattpad, can you guys explain to me how I change the font or boldness of a word, like italic and cursive, cause that would be HIGHLY necessary for me to write this story.
The funny thing is that I am so freakin nervous to publish this cause I have never written a story for others to see. O well! I am so gonna publish this.
