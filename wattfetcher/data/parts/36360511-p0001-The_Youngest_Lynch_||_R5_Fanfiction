Rosalie (Rosa) Emily Lynch is 14 years old and is the youngest Lynch. Her sister Rydel is a big influence to her and her brother Riker, Rocky, Ross & Ryland are showing her all their skills.
They met Ratliff a few years ago and they started a band. Well, Riker, Rydel, Ratliff, Rocky & Ross did while Ryland started DJ-ing.
Everyone in her life was busy so she didn't know what to do anymore.
Rosalie wasn't a good dancer at all even when her family was really talented. She maybe looked like them with her beach blonde hair and her beautiful hazel/green eyes but she wasn't that talented.
Will her siblings help her to find friends since she never visited a school?
Who will help her through tough times?
