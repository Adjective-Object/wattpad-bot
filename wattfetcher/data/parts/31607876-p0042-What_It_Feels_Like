There's little joy in life for me,And little terror in the grave;I've loved the parting hour to seeOf one I would have died to save.
Calmly to watch the failing breath,Wishing each sigh might be the last;Longing to see the shade of deathO'er those beloved features cast.
The cloud, the stillness that must partThe darling of my life from me;And then to thank god from my heart, To thank him well and fervently;
Although I knew that we had lostThe hope and glory of our life;And now, benighted, tempest-tossed,Must bear alone the weary strife.
-Charlotte BrontÃ«
