We kept looking at each other with confused eyes until a male with an accent yelled, "You there!"
We looked towards them, seeing a tall man in black with a eight year old child dressing up as an adult stood a few feet away from us.
A single blue eye scanned us from top to bottom. "Who are you?"
"Levi Ackerman."
"Ze-ro Namida. Nice to meet you, gaki." I stared at him with cold fiery red eyes. I'm assuming the man next to him was his butler. He had a smirk on his face.
"Sebastian..." The boy trailed off.
"Yes, my lord." And with that, we were knocked out...AGAIN!
Jesus...
