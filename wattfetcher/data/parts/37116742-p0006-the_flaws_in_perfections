As far as my eyes, they are red, puffy and painful.
I'm better off alone.
I always have been I always will be, bringing other people into my life has never caused anything worth doing it for.
Either I will rip their hearts out or they will mine.
I lost pieces of myself in everyone, and now that Ive nothing left to give I'm left hollow, vacant and grey.
Do I go or do I stay?
It wouldn't matter. I'm only a sideshow in their eyes. The person to call when your all alone.
Why would I steal this breath from someone who deserves it more?
I won't.
