~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Annabeth's POV
I was in the Athena cabin just doing some research when Percy came bouncing in, "hey wise girl" "hey seaweed brain" "Will come to the forest with me?" "sorry but I have to do work for school" "PPPLLLZZZ" he gave me puppy eyes  knowing u can't say no "Fine" I say sighing "YES" he screams like a five year old. I giggle. I follow him to the line of trees that starts the forest "now close your eyes" I give him a look "come on annabeth plz" "OK" I say unsurly. I close my eyes and feel Percy put his hands on my eyes as well "what? Don't trust me seaweed brain" "nope" I gasp dramatically and he giggles
Percy's POV
I lead her through the forest giving her small direction so she doesn't fall. "Are  we almost there" she asked "soon soon" I say we finally reach the cleaning and everything's looks good from here.
Annabeth's POV
"we're here" he says as he takes his hands of my eyes, as my eyes adjust I see a beautiful clearing. It's decorated with lanterns and candles. A blanket was laid out with the plates and goblets from camp the kind that summon what ever you want. And I see a small laptop at the end of the blanket. I look up at Percy to see him grinning "this is amazing Percy, but won't the laptop herd monsters over here" "don't worry Leo came up with a Monster prof electronics" he says as he drags me over to the blanket "Why did you do this" "cause today it's been 5 years snice we meet and I wanted to do something special." "I can't believe your ember that" "why wouldn't I it was one of the best days ever" "so what movie did you bring...... Let me guess "Finding Nemo"  he nodded and grins. As he lodes the movie in I get the plates and goblets the movie start and we snuggle up.
