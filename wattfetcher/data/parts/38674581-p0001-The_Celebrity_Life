I walk over to  my tacky bright pink locker and got out all the stuff I needed to (finally) go home. I texted Arianna.
Me: Ready?
Ari: Wait. G2G get ma stuff.
Me: Coolio.
I close the tab and continue to patiently wait at the trunk of a tree in the courtyard. In the distance I see a guy and a small girl figure making their way towards me. The girl reaches me first. "Hey Mads."
"Hey Ari."I reply while trying to control my tears at the sight before me. I'm a stupid crybaby that can't let a guy go. Ugh, I hate myself.  Ari shoots me an apologetic look. I shake my head slightly while staring at the happy couple before me. "Hi, Danny." I start. He turns to look at me.
"Hey Maddie!" he replies while embracing me. I smile, content. He backs away all too soon.
"Hello, Allison." I say quietly.
"Hello, Madison." she replies curtly. It didn't always be like this. Allison Meyer and I were besties. We called ourselves the Rhymin' Shinin' Duo. Stupid I know, but we were in 3rd grade! I told her that I had a huge crush on Daniel Shelton but she asked him out anyway. Of course, she being wayyyyy more prettier than I was, she got the guy. I tried to maintain our friendship but, it was too hard seeing him give her loving looks and kisses.
I was jealous. Who wouldn't be if the guy you liked since 2nd grade was in a relationship with your ex- best friend? Keep in mind, I'm in 10th grade. 8 years I've liked that idiot for 8 years. 8 years. Give it up, will you? You're 5 foot 8 inches of ugliness and stupidity. No wonder no one likes you. I sigh and get up.
"I have to start homework. Bye." I get up and walk away silently. I hear thuds behind me.
"Maddie?" I whip around only to be met with a chest. I look up to see Danny's face.
"Yes?"I reply politely.
"What's been up with you lately? You've been kind of ignoring me, and hanging out with only Arianna. Did I do something wrong?" he scratches the back of his neck. Which I find really cute. He's cute when he's nervous.
"I-I...." my brain says to tell him, and my heart says to run. But, I do neither and look straight into his eyes. He nods, encouragingly. I don't go on. He doesn't force me to.  "Meet me at our special place at 7. Okay?" I ask.
"Okay." he pauses. " Maybe okay shall be our always, Miss Lancaster." The weird thing was, that was actually my last name.
"Maybe it shall, Mr. Waters." I squeeze his hand and run to my sister's car.
"Hey Viv."
"Shut the f-"
"Tsk, tsk, tsk. No cussing this month, remember? I'm assuming you're on your period." I say looking at my nails.
"Ugh, you are so UGH" she groans.
TIME SSKKIIPP
I pace around the floor of our treehouse. He's 15 minutes late. I go out to the patio and breath. Inhale, exhale, inhale and exhale. There, don't you feel better. I feel arms sneak around my waist and lift me up. "I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE! LET ME GO OR I WILL KILL YOU! I HAVE THE RIPTIDE AND A WAND THAT IS CALLIN' MA NAME." I shriek. "Keep it down, my eardrums might burst."the man replies. I scoff. Then I realize the owner of the voice is none other that Daniel Shelton.
I stop struggling and still. He sets me down on the couch we have. "Why were you late?"
"Allison kept saying she wanted to go with me, but I refused."
