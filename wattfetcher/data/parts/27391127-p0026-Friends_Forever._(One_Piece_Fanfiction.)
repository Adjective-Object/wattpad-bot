Okay Minna. This is part of the double maybe triple update for not updating so long. Had trouble with the plot and finally got myself less busy and then there is my crappy phone. -3-it was being mean.

Haruka: Get to the damn chapter already.
Sakura: Shut up and lemme finish.

So guys, this song from Frozen is directly related to the chapter and the picture too...I guess. Anyways... sorry for the long wait and here is the chapter!

Haruka: Fucking yes, Finally! *slap*

"Because you look just like him."

Haruka was upset..no upest was not enough. His anger raged inside of him and he lost it.

"How dare this bitch compare me to him." Haruka hissed through his teeth. Twilight looked at him with the most innocent face in the world. She wondered what was happening.

"HOW DARE TO COMPARE ME TO THAT FUCKING-ASS PERSON! I'M NOTHING LIKE THAT DICK-HEAD!" Haruka exploded and that left poor Millie trembling in her spot.

Most noticeable was was when she crossed her hands over her face and Haruka looked at his hands. They were black.

"No. I'm becoming like him."

"Millie-chan, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean th-"

*smack*

"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! I WAS IN THE TOWN AD I COULD HEAR YOU!" Aya shouted, her fist steaming from her supposed use of Haki.

"Poor Millie-chan, must be tramutized for life." Aya pouted caressing the Princess' head like a dog.

(Much like the picture shows)

"Are you actually liking that?" Haruka asked watching the Princess literally melt melt under his friend's gentle touch and turning into a regular-sized Yorkshire Terrier.

"Hai." Millie curtly answered.

In the shadows, Gemi and Sayo watched as the friends had fun petting their elder sister. New feelings of jealously had been recently buried, rose again. And they walked away.

Sayo bumped into Sakura and Millie heard and saw them walk away. Sakura walked up to her and asked, "What's wrong with them?"

Millie looked away with a sad expression, "Nothing I can change." She answered softly before walking away.

"You should get ready for the coronation now." she advised soflty before disappearing around the corner.
