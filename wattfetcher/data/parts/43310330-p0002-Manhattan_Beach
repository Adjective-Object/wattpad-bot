I packed my things and wrote a note to my parents in the middle of the night telling them where I was going, and I never heard from them again.
I stayed at my girlfriend's house until I could find a job and somewhere to live.
Giselle's parents were always too drunk to care what she was doing, so I don't even know if they knew I lived there with her for a while. They would come home smelling like liquor and they would yell at Giselle in front of me some nights when they decided they had had enough to drink at the bar. They would slur their words so badly that you couldn't even tell what they were yelling about. Giselle would begin to cry and I would spend the rest of the night holding her and assuring her that we would get out of her house sooner than later.
Eventually, I got a job as a waitress at a really nice restaurant and I earned a lot of money from tips and I worked full-time so I got paid a decent amount of money. Giselle took her dad's place as the manager at a family-owned furniture store and got paid enough for us to live in a small but nice apartment in Los Angeles.
She was also going go college and getting her life on track while I worked to pay the bills at our apartment, but we were very happy. There was always enough time in a day for us to be together at home after we both got off work and she was done with school for the day.
What hurts me the most is the fact that I took all of the time we spent together for granted. I never stopped to appreciate how easy things were for us. I never stopped to appreciate the fact that she loved me as much as I loved her. Everything was always so good between us after we beat the distance, and I never stopped to appreciate the fact that we had everything figured out and that we had each other no matter what.
What's killing me inside is the fact that I could have saved her when she fell off of the pier into the water below us.
But I didn't react fast enough.
