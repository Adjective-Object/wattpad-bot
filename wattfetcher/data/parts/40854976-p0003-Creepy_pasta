New character!!! My friend helped me with my stories and is an amazing writer go check her out shadowproxies
My POV:
Just kidding! We didn't sleep!
We went to my room and unfortunately Alley decided to fall. Just kidding!
I pushed her!
"Hey! You bitch!" Alley screamed as she hit the floor. "That hurt!"
"Hahahaahahah! Sorry! But im not sleepy." I said.
"Me neither." Gali said as she sat on my bed.
"Lets play a game!" I screamed before Alley  could yell again.
"What game?" Gali asked.
"Tripple dog!" I yelled.
"No!" Alley yelled!  Last time we played I ended up stuck in my neighbors window and when Alley helped me out we both fell. She just won't let it go.
"Fine then what do you want to play?" I asked.  We faught for twenty minutes and couldn't decide a game. "Oh for the love of the moongoddess! Shut up! Let's just go to the woods." I said
"Your kidding." Gali said with a shaky voice.
"Nope this bitch is dead serious." Alley stated. I gave a stiff nod and smiled. "Yeah what's the worst that could happen. You could break a nail oh my god." Alley said with too much sacrasim. Gali smiled a little.
"Or you know we could die,get rapped,kidnapped, better yet we could get into the sex trading business." I told them. Gali then started to freak out... Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
"You think!" Alley yelled and smacked me.
"Said that out loud."
"Yep."
"Gali run and try to hide?"
"Yep."
"We going to get her?"
"Yep."
"P. Sherman 42 wallaby way Sydney?"
"Ye- wait what? Shut up idiot!" Alley said while I laughed. I love doing that. We walked down stairs to find Gali trying to grab every single knife in my house.
"Watcha doing there?" I asked her as she divided the knives into three groups.
"If were going out there, were going prepared." She said and started to put the knives in random places on her body.
"At least there's no needles." I mumbled while doing the same with my share.
"Yep." Alley said copying me. We had all our knives and flashnights the only thing left was someone who could get Gali out of the door. She is scared most of the time but when she needs to be she is brave enough to jump on a lion.
"Come on!" I yelled as we finally pushed gali out of the door.
"If I die I'm coming back and killing you two." She said as we reached the woods.
"Fair enough." I said as we all took the first step into darkness. All we could hear was our breathes and the crunches of the leaves and twigs as we walked. I turned my flashlight on and pointed it in different directions.It honestly looked like the woods you would see in a horror movie.
Crunch
Shit were gonna die.
"Did you hear that?" Gali whispered.
"Nope." I lied.
