"I HAVE A NAME!" Marco yelled.
"Oh, okay then. What's your name?" Millie asked, smiling.
"Marco."

Then Sakura tried to contain her laughter, "You must be the blonde pineapple Ace talks about."
A tiny blush formed on Marco's cheeks (mainly from embarrassment.), "I will kill that Fire Dick later."

"Language." Aya replied slapping him.
"So, why is Marco here again?" Sakura asked. She somehow got distracted from the topic.

"Because we went on a job without a senior student and now, we're gonna die."  Aya cried.

"Really, I didn't know that."

"Of course, you're new. I don't expect you to know." Haruka sighed.
"Who gave you the job?"
"Ace."

"Ace-sama gave you that job!" Haruka asked already holding Sakura by her dress.
"Yeah but he didn't tell me anything about  a senior student coming along. He said we could handle it."
"Ace-sama.."

----In Haruka's mind----

There was an Ace. (you know, the versions when the fangirls start fangirling with the sparkly eyes and all that shit.) and Sakura.

"Here is this job request I picked for your team." Ace said in a smooth sexy voice.

(Author goes outside, starts fangirling then returns to write the story.)

"Is there anything I need to know." Sakura asked (who by now in Haruka's mind looks like a total bitch now.).

"No, the only thing is that Haruka can handle it."
----------------

"Ace-sama, trusts me." Haruka sighed fainting from sheer fangirling  (well fanboying in this case)  and a slight nosebleed.

Millie started screaming in the background and Marco, Aya and Sakura all looked at his pale body.  Blood was seen trinkling from his nose and his eyes were hearts.
"Should we help him?" Marco asked.
"Nah, leave him." Aya amd Sakura answered harshly in perfect unison.
"But really, what happened?"
"Well, if I remember correctly....."

--------Entering the real Flashback-------

Ace handed Sakura a poster. She took time to notice it whilst occasionally glancing at her glowing bracelet.
