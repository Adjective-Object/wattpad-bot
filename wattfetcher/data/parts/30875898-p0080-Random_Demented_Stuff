It's aways a smile
Whether I'm happy or sad
When I'm depressed you can see this smile for a mile
It's always a smile
I don't think I know how to frown
At least not in public anymore
It's always a smile
When I feel mad or ready to die
It's always a smile
Even when I tell the lies
It's always a smile
Even when I'm feeling suicidal
Yeah, it's literally always a smile
