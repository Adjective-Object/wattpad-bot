The blade talks to me
Whispers so soft against my ear
Its voice calms me
It tells me that no one will take it away
It tells me that it's the one thing here to stay
It tells me that all I need is one long cut
One clean slice
It tells me that this is all I need
And I start to believe the blade
I believe in the blade because it tells me the words that I have been begging to hear:
This will make it ok
