"Well, I don't see you talking to any black guys."
I scoffed. "I have someone in mind already."
"Who?" Ashton and Calum both asked.
"Jesus calm down," I groaned.
"Tell me, who is this boy sista?" Calum pressed.
My brown eyes scanned over the cafeteria. They stopped when I saw this someone. He was sitting with his friends. They were pretty popular, only because everyone knew they could play instruments. Apparently, everyone loves boys that can play a guitar. Calum and Ashton could play guitar and so could I, although I'm not a boy. We just didn't show off our talents.
Calum followed my gaze and almost choked on his (Ashton's) chocolate milk.
"Honey, you know he doesn't like black girls," Calum whispered.
Ashton smacked Calum's arm. "Why do you always have to be so straight forward?"
"It's the only straight characteristic I have. I would like to embrace it."
I rolled my eyes at the two boys. "Maybe I can change his mind. Make him okay with the swirl."
Calum sighed. "Good luck with changing his favorite flavor from vanilla to chocolate."
"Thanks man."
