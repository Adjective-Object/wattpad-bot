Loxias's estate was not walled, but it was isolated. The manor stood on a hill surrounded by tall stately pine trees. This posed a problem; Loxias had a troop of guards spread out through the forests and there was very little undergrowth to hide the escapees. But fortune favoured them that night; it was the new moon and so the land was cast in darkness like pitch. Clouds blotted out the stars and so no light shone from the sky. If Anson had not been Bosmer they would have had no hope of navigating their path in this darkness, but the earth and the trees whispered to him and told him the way, thus guided by the very land they made their way eastwards towards Cyrodil and towards freedom.One of Loxias's guards was unlucky enough to be in their way, but the Mer had little time to contemplate his foul luck for Anson cleaved his head from his neck in one swift stroke. He was dead before he could say 'helmet'.

The sun was hot on Katya's back and shoulders as she trudged along the fore of her horse, the reins gripped tightly in her gauntleted hand. Anson walked along beside her, both of them road-weary, and covered in dust. They wore hide armour over their clothes and it smelled horrid, as it was impossible to clean entirely. They had eked out a living as sellswords in the provinces around the Imperial City of Cyrodil. They had spent the last few years venturing all around the realm, killing whatever they were hired to kill. Mostly bandits, though a couple of times they had been sent to clear out goblins from a mine near Kvarth. That had been Katya's least favourite job; she hated being underground in the dark and must. But it had paid a fat sum of septims and they needed all that they could get in order to make something better of themselves in Skyrim. They had been discussing entering the horse business. As head-stable hand at Loxias's manor Anson had seen the ledgers that his overseer wrote the names of his stud's breeders in. He knew of the names and prices of good breeding stock and felt certain that they could pull it off.
After collecting their bounty the two companions made camp outside of the Imperial City near the tents of a Khajiiti caravan. After they had thoroughly groomed the horses and picketed them, Katya removed her armour with relief and Anson began a campfire on the rocky ground and sat back against her saddlebags tiredly. At only nineteen years old she was already quite renowned as a mercenary here in Cyrodil. But she hated this country with a fury. These were the people who had killed her father and done only the Nine knew what with her father. Every time she passed an Imperial soldier she was hard-pressed to not spit on his gleaming leather armour, and if there were Thalmor nearby she would begin to shake with a rage that was white-hot and made her vision go red. What she sought was vengeance for her family, and justice for herself and for her people. How she longed to be out there fighting the Empire with her people, news of the Stormcloak rebellion had grown far more prevalent these days. In fact it was beginning to sound as if the Imperial oppressors were worried about Ulfiric's little uprising, and well they should be. Katya had no doubts that the Nine were on the side of the Stormcloaks. One day, she promised herself silently, One day I will join that fight.
