"Yeah sure, I'll send it to you, can't wait to see you" I was talking on the phone with Karam, he said he'd be here in two days.
The bell rang, it was Molly, "I brought the posters for tomorrow" Molly was really happy and excited, she finally got the chance to free herself, "Too bad, the International day is a day only" I frowned, "But, we can stick the posters on the walls, there's no rule that forbids it" Molly grinned. We talked and laughed for hours then I felt a pain in my stomach, it was either from the fries and burgers I had been eating to get fat and cover the belly I was getting from my baby, or because of the baby himself. I rubbed my belly and Molly noticed, she put her hand over mine, "Don't worry, everything is going to be fine, just never lose faith in Allah" Her words gave me hope, "In shaa' Allah" I smiled hiding my tears, "Simon won't let you go, he loves you" Molly sighed, "He doesn't" I wasn't sure of my words, I wasn't sure of his feelings toward me, his actions showed hate but his eyes, the worry in his eyes, sadness and care that I see in his eyes said that he was still in love with me.
The bell rang three times, "It must be Simon, he came to pick me up" I felt pain in my chest and sighed, "Don't worry, I'll talk to him" Molly patted my shoulder, "No! Don't, just forget about it" I said as I opened the door for Molly, Simon was standing on my doorsteps, I ran to the living room because I wasn't wearing hijab, "Now you are shy of showing your hair, Oh darling, I've seen much more than that" I wanted to spit on him so bad, I tried my best to stop myself. Molly told him to shut up, I thanked her then they left.
How come ? He turned into the a jerk ? How could he forget everything ? Was it nothing more than a lie ? Did he only want to have fun ? Did he use me to have fun ? Was it all a lie ? The park, the cafè, our secret place... Starbucks, were these all nothing than lies ? The words, the feelings, the touches, the electricity that hit me every time we touched .... Lies ? His eyes say No but his actions say Yes.

"LEENA, come to my office" the principal called, I was standing with Molly and Tom discussing something about Islam with some students we seemed really interested, "I want a copy from your book, what do you call it ? Qu-qu-", "It's Qur'aan" I smiled at the girl, "Yes, Qur'aan, I want to see what's in it, I want to know why you cover yourselves and are told to lower your gazes" She smiled, "Step by step darling, read these before" I gave her some papers and books to read, I was happy that I grabbed many students' attention to Islam, they wanted to figure out more and more about it, "I have to go to the principal's office, Molly will give you anything you want" I headed to the office, the terrifying office, I knocked the door and got in when I was allowed to, there were many adults in there, "Have a seat, Leena" The principal said and everybody started arguing and screaming, "What's wrong ?" I asked, "You ! You are ruining our children" A man said, "We spend years and years to grow them up and you come out of nowhere asking them to change their religion and blow themselves up" A woman said, What ? "HOLD ON ! What ? I'm ruining your children ? What are you talking  about ?" I frowned, "These parents are here to discuss the papers you've been giving to their children about Islam " The principal said, "Discuss ? Is that what discussing is ?" I mocked, "Ok, now listen, what is the problem ? Is it me giving your children some papers about my religion? Or is it because my religion is Islam ? Because there are some differences between those two" I smirked. "Don't try to brainwash our children" Someone said, "What ? Brainwash ? The whole thing is that I wanted to show the students the real face of my religion, and it was the international day, everybody showed their own. Now, if any of your sons or daughters tried to introduce me to their religion, you probably wont act this way. Now excuse me, I got things to do if you don't mind. Take these, you should probably read them too" I put few of the papers on the table, "You can't just leave like that" A parent said, "Yes I can, I can also smell some racism in the air and I do NOT like that smell" I smiled then glanced at the principal who winked at me as I walked out.
