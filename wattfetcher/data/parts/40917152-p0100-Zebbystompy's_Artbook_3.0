So I am Abby Mance and my mom is Kim Mott, she changed her name this year. Her dad died when she was like..what? 5? So she grew up as Kim Ian Mott. Her middle name is Ian because her dad wanted a son ;-;. So anyways...when my mom got married to my dad, she changed her name to Mance. They got divorced when I was like 2 or 3. So uh, she changed her name to Mott this year so her dead dad wouldn't be the last Mott. Here are some anagrams about her name.
