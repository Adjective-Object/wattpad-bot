"I once read "Everyone knows silence is never a good sign", and now that I think of it; silence can be the most dangerous weapon you could use against someone. Let me explain myself. It's the silence of a body that was once full of life. The silence of the nobodies after a war. The silence that's noticed when you're lost in the woods. The silence of rejection. The silence of a soul slowly slipping away. The enduring and painful silence when you know it's done and gone and you are all alone.
Have you ever heard a flower die? No. It's just silence.Have you ever heard someone yell "the war is over and everyone died"? No. But the silence is good enough to know it all happened.
You don't hear someone's death. You hear the beeping hospital monitor go to an eternal high pitched flat line but you never, hear the body.
If everything's quiet and you can hear someone's breathing, then it's not silence. There's just barely any sound.
It's silence when you can no longer hear them breathing."

Woaaah hi and sorry if that was depressing. I don't know. My mind is strange in every way.
Guys! Please leave your thoughts after quotes! I want to read what you interpret of each one and dont be scared to share. Remember what I said about the sky. Everyone's opinion is different.
Also, big thanks to Harry_Tomlinson_OTP for being SO FREAKING ACTIVE! You are the most supportive person I've seen so far.
PS. what if I revealed my actual age to you guys? If you want me to tell you, at least leave two more responses on quote page #22.
A lot of people already tell me how they think I am from the way I look but none of you have ever seen me so an opinion through your view of my thoughts would be great :)
