"Dean, I wrote 378!"
Now they were both laughing. Mary was still confused.
"You know, you should come over tonight," Dean said.
"Dean, I--"
"No, no! You're coming. It's final."
They exchanged numbers and addresses, and after the Winchesters left Barnes & Noble, Mary finally spoke.
"What tHE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!"
"Hey! Language!" Dean countered, not exactly sure what happened himself.
"Dad, you knew J. Novak and never told me?! I'm HURT!"
"We were... close in highschool and college."
Before Mary could react, Dean had said, "But... he had to move away. And that brings us to the letters. And now, here."
The only thing Mary Ellen could even think to say was, "You... you used to fuck J. Novak?"
"MARY ELLEN WINCHESTER. You watch your MOUTH. And it was more than that. It was love."
"You were in love with... Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god."
"I don't know if you've realized this, but Cas is gonna be in our house. Tonight."
She was silent for a moment. And then...
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!"
"MARY!"
And soon enough, Dean and Cas were married. And Mary had a "HOLY FUCKING SHIT" moment every day.
