Cinos:
I wasn't listening. Are you still flapping those lips?
I was just thinking, "Yo, did I give up a rib for this?"
Woman, I just don't know what your problem is.
All I know is you're acting like a colossal b!tch!
*Pause*
Sonic: Daaaaaaaang.
Me: Wonder how this is gonna go.
Cinos: ...I'm sorry.
Dream: I'm sorry, too.
Cinos: Alright, nice! *tries to kiss Dream*
Dream: Don't even think about it.
Cinos:OK, that's fine, we could eat.
Sonic: Who won? Who's next? You decide!
Me: Technically, they don't choose who next-
Sonic: Do you mind? I'm trying to do a thing here!
Me: -_-
Sonic: Thank you. EPIC RAP BATTLES OF OCS!
