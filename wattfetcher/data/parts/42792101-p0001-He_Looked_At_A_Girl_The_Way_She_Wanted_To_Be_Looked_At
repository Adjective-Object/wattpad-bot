"Onision..." Emma sighed as she finished watching an UhOhBro video. How she loved his videos. She had her own YouTube channel similar to his. She took suggestions from her subscribers and did videos on that topic, they were ether comedy sketches, songs, or just looking up things on the Internet. Just like Onision. She decided to contact him. She just wants to meet him. After finding the best way to contact him. She began her letter to Onision. "Dear Onision (Greg) I have become quite successful myself in the YouTube business. All thanks to you, you inspired my channel 'EmoDino'. Noticing that I am quite close to your home, I propose a request of collaboration. Please respond back with the email listen below.Yours truly,EmoDino (Emma)"I sat back and re-read it. After concluding that it was fine to send, I hit the send button and moved from my computer to my room. I sat there for an hour reading on my phone and took a bath. Dressed in a batman t-shirt to big for my body and shorts. I climbed into bed and fell asleep.
