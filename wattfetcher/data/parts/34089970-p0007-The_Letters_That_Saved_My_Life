She walked out to the car, waiting for her mother. Her mother came out and got in. Starting the car she turned to her daughter.
"Robin, I'm sorry but this is for the best.." She told her daughter as they drove away.
"Mom I don't think you get it. Your telling me that I can't see my best friend because you think that she's a bad influence on me?!?" The girl asked her mother. Her mother looked over at her before replying.
"Listen, I know she is a bad influence. When was the last time you got detention?" She asked her daughter.
"Yesterday..." The young girl answered.
"See? I told y-" shattering glass and screeching of tires filled the air. A scream escaped the young girls lips as the car rolled. After the car stopped the young girl looked over at her dead mother, her eyes lifeless, her skin cold and pale, blood pouring out of her mouth.
The young girl screamed for her mother, not believing that she was dead. Her screams soon turned into sobs. Sirens could be heard, closer and closer they came.
The young girl wished her mother was alive or at lest she had died as well in the crash...
