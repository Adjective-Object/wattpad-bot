So I know I haven't updated
Yes I'm a horrible human/demigod/dolphin/thing
But I have excuses
1) I'm sick
EwwwSee the thing about being Sandy Sick is I rarely get sick but when I do..."CALL THE FUCKING AMBULANCE SHE LOOKS LIKE A TOMATO/POTATO!"
Yup so I might update laterUnless I need the stupid doctor
#####2) I'm tired>.< z Z z
Simple enough explanation.

4) CRABBY CAKES MY HOMEWORK
