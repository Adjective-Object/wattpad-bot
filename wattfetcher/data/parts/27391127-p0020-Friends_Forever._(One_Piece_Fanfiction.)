"Princess Milliefiore E. Twilight."
"Then, you don't mind if I we call you Millie-chan?"
"No problems at all!" Twilight answered smiling. She can barely remember the last time she felt this happy.
"Did you pack any clothes for the coronation?"
"Well, not really." Sakura whispered, really not wanting to be heard.
"When we'll go look in the royal dressroom tomorrow morning before the coronation. There must be some outfits that fit you." Twilight said.
"Really? Thank you!" Aya thanked.
"A royal dressroom? So cool!"  Sakura awed with sparkles.
"Its nothing to get excited over, bitches." Haruka cursed....again.
"That's six."
"You shitty unicorn."
"Seven!"
"Quit that fluffy bitch!"
"Eight."
"Sorry, geez."
"That will not save you." Aya commented.
"You can't even apologize you arrogant brat." Sakura and Twilight noted sweatdropping.
Somewhere along the vast Grandline, in a dark room which was only illuminated by a flickering candle.
"How did it go?"
"Not very successful sir. Plus we realized that the the Prince of Beelzebub is there."
"Nani? What is such a powerful person doing here?"
"We don't know sir but that's all to report, sir."
"Okay. I'll send in reinforcements tomorrow."
"Okay." The Den Den Mushi spoke before hanging up.
Why would the Prince of Beelzebub be in such a place? Probably this is King Malum's doing. One can never tell what that family thinks of.
Elsewhere, on Mariejois....
"We've got a problem."
"I know."
"The Lightning Demon, Haruka and The Sky Maiden, Sakura is on Candy Island."
"What about the Glitter Fairy, Aya."
"She's not a threat right now. But we must get rid of those two."
"We already have a plan for the Lightning Demon, its the Sky Maiden we're worried about."
"Why not put her in Impel Down."
"Are you crazy? She's there already."
In one of the cells of Level 6 in Impel Down, a figurine is shown on the floor, sitting with her legs criss-crossed.
"Oi, time to eat." One of the guards yelled.
At this, the figurine looked up with her eyes glowing red. Next thing you know, the guard's body fell on the ground....







Withered.
