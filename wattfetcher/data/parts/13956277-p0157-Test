"So, Okay?" Simon asked
"No, I'm not going with you" I declined
"Why ? It's just one night and everybody is having a date, why won't you be mine?" He put his puppy face on.
"Let's just say that ... I have higher standards" I laughed then headed to my class.
It was 'Prom' night, everybody was going. My phone rang and it was Molly, "So, are you going ?" She asked, "No, you know Music is haram and there will probably be people doing haram things which I don't want to see" I explained, "Wallah I know, but just listen, We'll go for 5 minutes and see what's going around, Wallah only 5 minutes then we'll go eat some pizza or watch a movie in my house" She kept talking and trying to convince me, "FINE" I hung up.
I didn't wear anything fancy, just my simple black Abaya and a red Hijaab, I knew I wasn't supposed to go but ... curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see what was going on inside the party.
We reached the party and everything was looking nice, boys in suits and girls in long and short gorgeous dresses, "I really want to dance" Molly sighed and I pinched her, "Astaghferollah ! What are you saying ? Just wait few years and you'll be able to dance with your husband in a white dress" I chuckled, "Well, can I be that man that gets you dancing in for him and only him in a white dress?" Here comes Simon, "I rather die than be yours" I laughed, "Why ? Ain't I perfect ? I mean, look at these girls glaring at me and looking at you with jealousy in their eyes because I'm talking to you. Who is your dream guy ?" He asked.
"Hmm, I want him Tall" I said, Simon smiled .
"With a dark skin" I said.
"Well, I can get a tan" He sighed.
"With hazel eyes" I chucked.
"Eye lenses" He answered.
"Arab" I laughed.
"Assalamu Alaykum" He said and I exploaded in laughter and Molly left to talk to some of her friends.
"No, Just no." I chuckled.
"I won't let you go" He said.
"Too bad, I'm leaving to Britain" I sighed.
"WHAT ! WHY?" He freaked out.
"They called me from Cambridge university, they offered me a scholarship after they received my grades somehow ... It's a tempting offer, me and Karam talked about it and he is totally fine with living in Britain and running our companies from their, especially that we have 3 there" I explained, "And it will be a new fresh beginning from my and my ... baby" My heart ached.
"No ! Don't go, we'll work it out together, I can't live here without you" I could sense honesty in his voice.
"Let's just not talk about this now. Remember our secret place ? Let's go there once again for the last time, chat and laugh" I suggested.
"Fine" He nodded sadly.
"But not alone, let's go with all of our friends. Drinks on me" I smiled and he nodded.
...
We all sat around a table, Damon, Diana, Helen, Hannah, Molly Tom Simon and Me, talking and laughing.
"I need to tell you something" Simon said.
"What ?" I raised an eyebrow.
"Alone" He whispered and we got out of starbacks and stood beside a tree.
