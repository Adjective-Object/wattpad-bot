"Fairy Tail, eh?" I said to myself as I flicked my dagger. Little droplets of blood flew away with the small movement. I smirked to myself as I walked around a dismembered body. My black hair was going wild in the wind as I made my way to the town to collect my payment. My eyes darted to my left when I heard a low moan. I looked lazily over my shoulder to see who had made the noise. A man was on the ground holding his stomach while a puddle of blood formed around him. Oops, I had left one alive. I shook my head and walked over to the man. I stood over him while he stared up at me with fear in his eyes. "P-please...don't." I flung my dagger and it hit home. Headshot. I turned on my heel and stalked out of the area. I called for my dagger and it came flying to the palm of my hand. I sighed tiredly, Fairy Tail...sounds interesting. It was time I took a little trip to Magnolia.
