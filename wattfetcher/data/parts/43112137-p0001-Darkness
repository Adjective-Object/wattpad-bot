The Dark Days
------------------------------
- Nedra POV -
_______________________
All I could see is the dead, cold, blood-stained body in front of me as I dropped the knife. All the light in the world has dissapeared to somewhere else. Fear was everywhere and loud shreiks filled the area. Then, when I dropped the knife, the place went silent. I ran into the forest as I saw something that hasn't been seen in over 30 years. I saw almost everyone there. We all saw this little gleam of light.
This shocked everyone as they just at there and watched her light burn and it was a match being lit on a candle. Soon, many people were there at the light. I ran towards the forest as the light returned back onto the land.
'Was this end of the dark days where nothing but fear was on the earth? Was there going to be any more fear?' I asked myself in my mind.
I we net to the one place where the light doesn't shine on the land. Where fear can roam without being stopped. Where the shadow can play without being disturbed.
Many people from the dark days went to the forest with me not wanting to be "the good guy". Then I thought about what would happen if the dark days were to return.
This wasn't the end of the dark days for they will return because you can't beat me if incan now fear.
I have decided to make an army of the shadow to get rid of the light, the good, and have the shadows take over the world like they used to.
" We will need to make a place for shadow and we will need to train you to get ready for the new war that has started!" I announced as I became the ruler of shadows. The ruler of darkness. I have become fear.
