As u can tell I am happy today because I was just watching CSI Las Vegas a little while ago. I am kinda bored cuz my friends wont message me back :,(. lol naw I am gewd there is nothing Billy Talent cant make upbeat. srry I was off topic but anyways...... its Saturday May 2nd and my birthday is in 12 days!!!!!!!! I just realized that may is a very exiting month. on the 14th is my birthday, 19th is a friends birthday, 29-21st I am going to the capital city of my province (I am Canadian hence the name) and on the 22nd I have my spring concert thing. I may have missed a couple of things but it is the weekend, I don't think straight. All I know is I am craving a Timmy's ice Capp right now geez what is with me;). I just wanted to update this book for now and I may just delete the book on my other account. it is barely anything so I might do that right now. well this is Angel and I shall update either tonight before bed or maybe Wednesday if I am not hanging with @fuzzycat2022 or @elsasings1237, back as what I was saying, this is Angel and I will see u all later bye:)
