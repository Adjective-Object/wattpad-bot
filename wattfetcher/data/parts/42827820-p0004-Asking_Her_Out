"Okay guys," Mike stopped the fight, folding her arms. "Why were you dressing up like a waiter and fry cook?"
"Well... You see..." Chicken rubbed his arm nervously.
"We're helping Scott out with getting together with Jade." Lightning admitted.
"LIGHTNIN', YOU NINCOMPOOP!" Chicken squawked at him.
"Sha-What did I say?"
"Aww, Scott has a crush on Jade," Dee Dee smiled dreamily. "How sweet~"
"I think I'm gonna be sick." Abby moaned, she was never interested in romance mush.
"And you two are helping him?" Mike glanced at the two.
"Yeah." Chicken said.
"I think it's sweet," Justine smiled. "Maybe Scott can change from his devious ways."
Lightning put his arm around her shoulder. "Sha-yeah, it was my idea in the first place." he said to her with a smirk, hoping it would amaze her.
Chicken rolled his eyes. "Idiot."
Jo growled at Lightning. "Unless you wanna keep playing football, I suggest you get your arm off her!"
"Bro, what's your damage?" Lightning glanced back.
"He's in for it..." Chicken sighed. "Oh, boy..."
Jo grabbed Lightning by his shirt, nearly scowling like a hungry wolf.
"Man, are you trying to kiss me? You know the Lightning don't roll that way."
"He's done it." Eddy muttered.
"Idiot." Abby added in agreement.
Jo growled and punched the boy in her hold.
"Oww, Lightning's eye!" Lightning groaned as he grabbed his, now blackened, left eye.
"Quit whinin', you big baby." Jo rolled her eyes.
"Hey Justine, can you make Lightning's eye feel better?"
"Want me to go for the other eye?"
"Nope... I'm sha-good..."
"Anyway, have you tried a practice date?" Mike asked the boys.
"A what?" Chicken asked.
"You know, have a girl pretending to be the guy's crush and have a practice date..."
"Can Justine be the girl?" Lightning asked, suddenly excited again.
Jo snarled at him.
"Or not..."
"Hmm, I'll think about it," Chicken shrugged. "Thanks Mike... Come on, 'musclebrain'.
Lightning tried to say something to Justine.
"Don't even think about it, Jockstrap!" Jo hissed.
"Aww..." Lightning groaned in defeat, then left with Chicken. This should be good.
