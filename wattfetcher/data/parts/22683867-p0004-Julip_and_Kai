A Girls night out!
" Okay, so what's the plan? " Kai asked excited. " Were going to take my car to your house and.... " Wait wait wait you have a car?" Kai asked interrupting Julip talking. " Yes, keep up. ., Julip said annoyed by Kai's interrupting. Now when we get to your place we will pack your bags and things, then we will have a girls night out! Doesn't that seem exciting?" Julip said excited. " I don't know Julip?, Kai said hesitating, we have to be back by 8 pm and the principal was very serious when she said that. " Kai!!! Come on its 1 pm and we have seven hours to go, why not? " Julip said begging Kai. " Alright, Kai said. Let's have a girls night out! Kai and Julip went to Kai's house and rung the door bell. Ding dong ,ding dong ,ding dong.......... Nobody answers the Door. Diiiinnnggg. ... Silence filles the air, so Kai tries crawling through her bedroom window. " Is this safe? " Julip asked in a small voice. " Of coarse It is! " Kai said loudly. Kai breaks the small screen door to her window and crawls in. " I will be right back! " Kai yells from inside. Then there's a jingle at the door and Kai opens it. " Come in! " Kai says . " Wow I love your house! " Julip gasps. " Thanks Kai says, it's a bit of a mess but who cares. " Okay let me show you a tour of my house, or should I say 5 second tour . Ready... set.... go... living room, kitchen, my room, mom's room. DONE! "Kai says almost out of breath. " Wow that's a world record Julip says laughing. Okay okay okay let's start packing." Kai opens her room to see a bed with no blanket or sheets, all that was in there was a luggage and a note. Then Kai bursted into tears " I can't believe she left me here and didn't even tell me! I hate her so much right now i don't know what to do! " Calm down Kai, I know this is hard for you to take in right now okay but we will get through it together. Now give me a hug! " Julip said trying to cheer up Kai.
