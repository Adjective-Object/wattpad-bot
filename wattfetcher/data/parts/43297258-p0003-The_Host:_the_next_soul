I growled under my breath.
"Okay fine grab her" the first one said
"Whatever" the one named Jessie said. He got out and grabbed my arm
Just as I grabbed a knife. I swiped his cheek. He gasped and stumbled back. I was a little scared. He has muscle and he looked angry.
He almost lunged at me but I put my knife out.
"Don't come any closer" I hissed
"Aren't souls supposed to be nice" one of them murmured
"I guess this one is different" the other mumbled
"I would have come" I whispered. "You didn't have to attack me"
He looked surprised but nodded. I pushed him away and he glared. I snorted. The other two boys were trying not to laugh.
I got in and sat next to a bunch of boxes. The knife was still in my hands. The boy in the front looked at me
"Did you give yourself those cuts?" He asked
I scoffed
"I may be violent but I'm not suicidal or depressed" I snapped he just put his hands up in defeat
And when Jessie got in he sent me a glare. Then we drove off.
To wherever they were taking me........
