Italy twiddled his thumbs and spoke, "Um, well, I'll... make... pasta and pizza..."


Germany went over to our side. "I'll contribute with beer and wurst."


Spain gave a big smile and exclaimed excitedly, "And then we'll all sleep together in a huddle!"


"Uhhhhh.........Yeah! Sure, why not?" I said, laughing. I am so dead.


Japan noticed me and spoke, "Don't worry, I'll lay out the futons in the other room. You can go to sleep whenever and wherever you like."


"Oh! Oh! I could show you guys the episodes of 'Hetalia'! You know, the anime you guys are characters in from our world!" I told them excitedly.


America bounced over to me and exclaimed, "Eh?! Really? I would love to see that!"


"Yeah! I have the complete episodes of it from Season 1 to 5. Including extra episodes!" I told him proudly.


"Sounds interesting. Hmm... what should we bring as a gift? Maybe we should send it beforehand, don't you think, Veneziano?" Romano asked his younger brother.


Italy beamed and nodded. "Yeah! We'll bring the best ingredients--lots of them!"


"Oh! I'll bring (favourite food)." I told them, getting into it, too.


Germany spoke up in a low voice, "I'll bring the beer."


"But you already said that, Germany!" I giggled, nudging him with my elbows.


The blonde German became a bit flustered, not noticing he had said his favourite drink earlier. "Oh. Right." he said in an embarrassed tone, but smiled.


"There's nothing wrong with more beer!" Prussia defended. We all began laughing and giggling, enjoying the conversation.


Japan was chuckling, as well. Then he turned to Italy, "It'll be fun. Really fun. That's why, Italy..."


"Yeah?" he asked curiously.


Japan placed a hand on Italy's shoulder and spoke in a serious, yet soft tone. "That's why we all have to escape. With everyone who is here, without losing a single person."
