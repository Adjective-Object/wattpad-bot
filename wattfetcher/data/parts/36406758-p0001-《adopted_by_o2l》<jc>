Hi
My name is lucy.im an orphan. Iv had a pretty bad life I guess.iv been sent to bad family's and have been threatened, hit, beat up
Im so bord so I decide to go out on my penny board."BE BACK BY 3 THERES SOME PEOPLE COMING" my social worker shouts as I walk out the door.its not like there gonna adopt me anyway.
I was riding around the park.drinking ice tea and just eating then I relised it was 2:56"CRAP"i race back home..I mean to the orphanage.i see the back of 5 guys heads.nothing special. I need to hurry.
造jc pov造Today im going to get a daughter.im only with sam, kian, ricky and connor because trevor is doing some singing shit."hello welcome" says an old lady.
Just as I was about to speak a young girl charges past us."sorryimlatekerryimgettingdressednow"is all I make out.shes wearing an beanie and has a penny board in hand.she seams cool.
