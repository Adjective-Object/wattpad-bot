It was a Saturday night, November 8th, 2014. Joe Chambers, a Philadelphia 17 year old rushed to the scene of a burning police car where he saved Police Officer Mark Kimsey’s life.
A t-bone collision had involved a police cruiser and a black Toyota pick-up truck. He ran to help the officer; the unit was on fire was at the bottom.
The police officer couldn't feel or move his legs. He attempted to open the door, but it was jammed shut. Even though the risk of the whole car exploding, he and his neighbor,  Dante Johnson, pulled the officer through the window. When they were halfway though, the whole engine blew up.
Kimsey was sent to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with burns on his legs and a head injury because of the airbag deployment. He later ended up in stable condition.
Officer Kimsey said, "He's my hero, by far. If he wouldn't have pulled me out of that car, I'd still be sitting in it."
The seventeen year old hero, Joe Chambers is a volunteer firefighter, but he said, "I just did what I hope anyone else would have done. I would do it any day of the week if I had to."
Chambers was hospitalized with only minor injuries, but he said it was worth it. Later that night Chambers visited Kimsey. Right then and there a special bond was formed. Now Officer Kimsey not only had his life saved, but gained a friendship.
