So I only just recently started watching Naruto. If you want to know how recently, I mean a few days ago, so pretty darn recent. I've really enjoyed what I've watched so far and I had a good idea for this Kakashi x Reader. I may not have been watching Naruto as long as some of you guys, but I hope you'll still enjoy what I've written with my currently limited knowledge of it. Please correct me if I get anything wrong, and tips, pointers, and info are greatly appreciated!Thanks!!
