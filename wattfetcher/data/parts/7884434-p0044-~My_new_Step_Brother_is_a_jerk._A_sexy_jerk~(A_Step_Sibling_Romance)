Shea's P.O.V
Calvin was the one who called the police.
When Seth told me that I couldn't believe it.
Honestly, Seth and I are also really lucky because mom went on a business trip with his dad and again Lisa was with his grandmother. So they won't ever know about it...
Me and Seth are home alone, and Im honestly petrified. My bodies been shaking like crazy ever since Casper touched me those ways.. I cant sleep. Nightmares are literally clouding my mind..
I feel Seths arms wrap around my small body from behind and I slightly jump, not expecting it.
"Baby you okay..?" He says softly in my ear as he rubs my waist. I pull away and rub my upper arm.
"S-Seth.." I begin. He shakes his head and walks over to me, his hand resting on my upper arm.
"Shea there is no way in hell I am going to touch you or hurt you like that bastard did. I have no intention of hurting you.. Baby I love you.. Ive never said that to a girl.. Im here to love you.. Let me love you" He wraps his arms around me and kisses my forehead, and I instantly relaxed.
"Im just.. It was so scary Seth" i whisper as I begin to cry. "It was all my fault. Ive been so fucked up since I was a kid. I kept going back and forth because I didn't know what I wanted. I didn't know what love or liking someone felt like. I was scared to get attached Seth. Last person I cared about died Seth. They fucking died. I couldn't let someone back in like that and experience all that pain all over again, it awful" I sob as I cling to him. He rests his head on mine and kisses it softly.
"Baby I promise.. You're not going to loose me." He whispers as he softly caresses my face, wiping away my tears. He looks in my eyes and smiles. "You're so god damn beautiful Shea" A deep blush covers my face and he softly leans in and kisses my nose. I smile softly and he then leans down and picks me up, holding me bridal style.
"C'mon princess lets go lay down. Ill give you cuddles and make sure you sleep okay" He whispers as he gives me a gentle eskimo kiss. I blush and nod, laying my head on his chest.
He walks up the stairs and down the hall to my bedroom. I just hold onto him and close my eyes, taking in his beautiful scent. As he makes his way to my room, he opens the door and brings us inside. He lays me on the bed softly and pulls the blanket over me. I smile at him and he walks to the other side of the bed. He removes his shirt and I blush and look away giving him privacy.
"You know you dont have to look away" He chuckles and I look over at him and roll my eyes playfully. "Don't make me tickle you Shea" He warns as he crawls into the bed.
"No! Don't do th- Hahahaha Seth stop!!!" I wasn't fast enough. He starts tickling me and I squirm around. My laugh echoing through the room. I try to pry his hands off of me.
"Say mercy!!!" He says laughing as he tickles me. God his laugh.
Im laying there gasping for air as I laugh. "M-Mercy!!!" I yell through a fit if giggles.
He stops and hovers over me. As I catch my breath I look up at him and I notice how close his face is to mine. He closes his beautiful eyes and rests his forehead on mine. "God Shea you're so beautiful" My face turns crimson red again with a blush. He gently rubs his nose against mine and my big brown eyes flutter shut.
"And you're so damn handsome" I whisper. I slightly open my eyes and I see he's already looking at me, a smile on his face and a blush on his cheeks. Aweee he's so fucking cute.
He softly bites his lip and I watch. Oh fuck.
