"Sorry, but your card has expired" she apologized.
"Oh, It's fine" I frowned.
Now I have to face some humiliating comments from Damon and Lewis.
"Try this" I shot my head up and saw Damon passing his Visa card to the girl.
"No No thank you" I pulled it from the girl's hand and gave it back to Damon.
"It's Okay, Take it" Damon ignored me and passed the card to the girl again.
"No thanks you don't need to" I pulled the card back.
"You're from the family now, and you'll pay me back soon or later, right ?" He payed for me.
DAMON DID SOMETHING NICE ! YOU HEAR ME PEOPLE !!! WRITE THIS IN YOUR DIARIES, THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERYDAY.
mind: don't celebrate, he'll be his jerky self in few minutes.
"Wanna have some fries ? I'm hungry" Elina said and we all agreed.
We went to the restaurants' floor and chose a table.
Elina and Lewis went hand by hand to order their fries, I wrinkled my nose at them, Damon saw me and laughed.
"Why are you jealous of her" He asked after we became alone on the rounded table.
I know that a male and a female are not allowed to stay together alone, but we were in a public place .. that makes it Okay, Doesn't it ?
"What? me ? jealous of Elina ? and for what ? for having a boyfriend" I asked in disbelief and he nodded.
"Ha Ha, believe me man, I just feel sorry for her, because we all know that they're gonna break up and break her heart on the way. And believe me, If I wanted a boyfriend I'll get one in a matter of seconds, but I won't since it's wrong and not allowed in my religion ... and why am I explaining for you ! I don't care about what you think of me, just go and get your food" I shooed him.
"Curly fries or normal shape" He asked me.
"No thank you, I'll buy myself some fries if I wanted any, believe me I'm not that broke, I got some cash" I shook my bag to let him hear the money inside it.
Damon chuckled "You're real, honest and say whatever comes across your mind truthfully, I like that" He smiled, I stared at him " oh ... you're so cheesy" then acted like I was throwing up.
"Typical Leena, I ain't surprised" He giggled.
"Just go get your food Mr.Annoying"
"New nickname ha?" he raised an eyebrow and I did too
"65" We both said in sync and laughed.
"I'll get you normal fries, no objections" He left.
me: He's actually nice.
mind: WHAT ! NO you can't like him.
me: I'm NOT ! I'm just saying he may not be as bad as I thought he is.
We ate the fries, which were delicious, we chatted about few things and laughed about the pranks Lewis and Damon did in school, then went back home without the annoying (Lewis), even his name sounds annoying, but he has a good heart.
The three of us held the bags of clothes and threw them in the house.
"Here you are, I was waiting for you to help me" Mrs.Carter smiled.
"At last ! where have you been the last few days, we missed you" I hugged her
