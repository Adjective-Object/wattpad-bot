CHAPTER TWO: THE PROMISE

“Ching, why are you in a hurry? Aren’t you going to eat first?” Yeah, they call me ‘Ching’ here. Isn’t that the lamest nickname ever? It’s not even a simpler version of my name – it’s just… bad. Good thing no one knows that at school.
“Sorry Ma. I need to sleep early. Thanks for the invite though!” I need to sleep. I need to freaking sleep. I must’ve been so tired I can’t seem to process things properly. Yes, that’s it! I’m just tired. I need to sleep this off.
“Oh. Okay. Don’t forget to wash first!”
“Yes Ma!”
I rushed upstairs and went straight to the bathroom. I filled the tub with lukewarm water and hurriedly soaked myself in it. I sat there thinking about everything that happened. I splashed some water to my face to keep me alert but it did not manage to help me at all. I’m still immersed in my current thoughts. What if he was telling the truth? What if he’s just making fun of me?
“Gahh! So many what-ifs!” I scratched my head as I applied shampoo to my hair. Seriously, I was caught off-guard with what he said. I did not expect it to come from Ice. I mean, what the hell happened to him? There’s no way I heard things correctly. There’s no freaking way. “Chill Chase. Don’t stress too much about it. There’s always tomorrow to confirm everything.” Yeah, I’ll make sure to confront him tomorrow.
I dried myself up and started changing my clothes. I opened my closet and saw something that I really value a lot. It’s a necklace my savior dropped after he came to my aid. Well, it’s a pretty long story. Let’s just say, up until now, I’m still looking for the owner. But I’m slowly beginning to lose hope – it’s been almost a year already.
Sigh. I returned the necklace inside the closet. It breaks my heart every time I look at it. I haven’t had the chance to see who he was. More so, I wasn’t able to express my gratitude for what he did to help me. This necklace is just a reminder of how much of a failure I was as a person.

“So many things happening in one day – I’m so tired.” With that, I went to bed and called it a day.
==========================================================
I woke up tired. The thing with Ice has been stressing me for what has seemed like eternity. I usually don’t mind problems that much and I face them as they come but this looks like a different case. I’ve never encountered anything like this before. This is the first time I’ve ever been confessed to – by a guy, that is.
“Damn Ice. Is he happy making people miserable?” I sighed as I headed down for breakfast. The only thing keeping me sane is the scent of bacon being cooked. “Ma! Is that bacon? Yum!”
“Oh Ching! Yes, it is. This will be finished in a moment. Come, sit here.”
“Sweet!”
“So, how’s your sleep? You seem tired.” Ma, please don’t bring that up.
“All good. Wait Ma! I thought you’re going somewhere today with Pa?” Obviously, I had to change the topic. I don’t wanna’ hear anything that has to do with Ice. Not right now, when I’m about to enjoy my breakfast.
“Not until afternoon, Ching.”
“Oh I see… Anyway, thanks for preparing breakfast for me Ma!”
“Of course, anything for you my love!”
