"Nope!" She said with a pop. "You're wearing make-up!"
"No! Anything but that! Last night was an acceptation! We're only going to school! No, get away from me with that!" I said when she pulled out eyeliner. I swear that is most likely one of the three things I can identify.
"Jaycie! Come on! Greg's Mom wants to see you in make-up!" She complained.
"She can see me with make-up some other time!" I say while running away.
I almost tripped once. Dang, I'm trying to hard. Although she's a vampire. She can be anywhere! Next thing I know she's in front of me. You see I told you!
"Jaycie, I'll tell your Dad you aren't cooperating." She said.
"Dad would be proud of me!" I said as I ran the other way to only run right into Skull.
"Jaycie, if you cooperate, I'll give you 20 bucks." He said.
"Tania! I'll do it!" I said turning around.
I heard Chase and Skull laughing.
"Don't laugh. I'm broke." I grumbled under my breathe.
"Come on." She said having a side smile of her own.
"Do we have to go to school again? Can't we just skip to the go home part?"
"I wish. You know how Talon's parents are like when I skip school. My parents couldn't care less but they care. I don't want them yelling at me either." She said.
"Yeah. I don't want my Dad to yell at me either. Oh also if Paul asks, you packed this." I said motioning to my clothes as she did my make-up.
She smiled and finished my make-up within five minutes I'm guessing. We grabbed our bags and went to the car. I put both my bags in the cars trunk. I went to the back to see that Chase was holding the door open. I smiled at him.
"Thank you Chase." I said and kissed his cheek.
I got in the car with a smirk and he just stood there with surprise. Hehe! I made him speechless.
"Jaycie, did you have to freeze him?" Skull asked a smirk on his face.
"Shut up, Skull." We both said.
I just made a weird face with him and they laughed. He got in and we took off for school. He moved me to sit next to him. I laughed a little at him. He just gave me a boyish smile. He kissed my cheek and I turned red.
"Stawhp!" I said hiding my face.
"Stawhp, what?" He asked while mimicking me.
"Both of ya stop it! I don't want to hear kissing back there! Gosh, they aren't even a couple yet and they are being lovey dovey." Tania said with a grin.
"Shut it Tania." Chase said.
I rolled my eyes but I was obviously amused at this. Chase hugged me to him and we just sat there next to one another.

Arriving to school I became nervous. I never went to school without my usual skinny jeans and converse. Once they parked I was actually wanting to hide.
"You know, you guys go ahead without meeeEEEEE! CHASE!" I screamed as he pulled me out and carried me.
"Tania, Skull, please get Jaycie's school bag out." Chase said.
"Sure thing." Skull said.
"Chase! Put me down!" I pouted.
