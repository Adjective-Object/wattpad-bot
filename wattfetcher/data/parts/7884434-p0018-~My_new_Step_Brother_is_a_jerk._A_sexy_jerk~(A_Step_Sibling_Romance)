They where right I did want Seth, but liking you Step Brother is frowned apon last time I checked. I don't know what it is about him that makes me want him so much. Hes an asshole!
A sexy asshole
Oh you shut up!
I want to tell him how I feel, but its obvious he is using me. Im not going to let this bother me. I am now going to makeout with Casper. Infront of Seth. Make him want me.
I stormed downstairs. Seth and Casper where in an argument. I walked up to Casper and turned him towards me. I jumped onto him and attacked his lips with mine.
Right
Infront
of
Seth
Casper held me by my butt and squeezed it gently making a moan escape my lips. God damnit. I still couldn't get Seth out of my head. I need to try harder.
I know i'm going over board but I don't know what else to do.
I was ripped off of Casper and throw onto the couch. I sat there looking between the 2. Casper was angry and Seth was furiated.
"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE AND AWAY FROM SHEA RIGHT NOW CASPER!" Seth yelled in a voice I had never heard before. It was scary. I was frightened. He had no right doing that. But could he possibly be jealous?
"SETH WHAT THE HELL MAN? I LIKE HER SHE LIKES ME! OBVIOUSLY NOT YOU! LEAVE HER ALONE AND LET HER BE WITH WHO SHE WANTS!" Casper yelled back at Seth. His voice was scary too.
"NO! SHE WILL BE MINE!"
"NO MINE!"
"I'M LIVING WITH HER! I HAVE A BETTER CHAN-"
"KEEP IT UP AND BOTH OF YOU WON'T HAVE ME! LAST TIME I FUCKING CHECKED I WASN'T AN ITEM! I'M NOT FOR SALE! I'M GOING TO MY ROOM! BOTH OF YOU LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!" I started crying at the ending and ran to my room.
"Shea wait!" I heard Seth yelle after me. I just kept going. Seconds later I was pulled into his hard chest. "Shea please stop crying I hate when you cry baby. Please stop" He said softly in my ear. I turned around and slapped him.
"Don't you dare 'baby' me! I AM NOT YOUR BABY! STOP ACTING LIKE YOU FUCKING CARE! NO ONE HAS EVER CARED EXCEPT MY DAD! I AM NOT LETTING YOU IN LET ALONE ANYONE ELSE! STOP TRYING AND LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!"
"No" He said softly.
"Why not?" I asked
"Becasue I do care! God Shea do you know how painful it is to see you kiss another guy knowing that its not me showering you in kisses!? Its torture! And when you fucking jump in his freaking arms and attack him mouth right in front of me? Are you trying to hurt me!? He yelled.
"Seth thats bullshit!" I said back
"I told you I want you. I told you I always get what I want! If I didn't want you I would have stopped trying a long time ago! God your so dificult!" He said pushing me up against the wall. "Why can't you just see how much I fucking want you? Not only your body but you. Just you. I don't want sex from you, yet. But I want you just you. No one else. Your killing me Shea. Since you came along I can't fucking think streight. I know I can be a jerk and an asshole. But thats just my way of putting myself out there. Please just give me a chance!"
"Seth do you not remember our parents might get married I am not fucking dating my soon to be stpe brother! I'm sorry" His eyes grew watery. Was he seriously going to cry? "Are you going to cry?" I asked in disbeliefe.
