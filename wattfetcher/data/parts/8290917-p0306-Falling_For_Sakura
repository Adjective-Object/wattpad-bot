Sakura gazed up at him and noted that he was serious about her moving in with them. "I'll think about it," she said, chuckling. When he gave her a brilliant smile, she laughed. "Now, I really, really must go. Good night, Sebastian."
Sebastian laughed. "Goodnight, Sakura sweet heart," he said and kissed her on the forehead once again. "Dream of me tonight."
Sakura turned, and before she could open the door, Sebastian caught her wrist and brought her hand to his lips. He gave her a hot kiss there, his warm breath against her skin made Sakura breathless.
When he finally did let her go, Sakura was ready to throw herself into his arms once again. He had that raw effect on her, she just realized. And they had just reunited that day after one long year. How odd. Perhaps, she reasoned herself, it was just the fact that she had been so lonely for so long, had been by herself for so long that his very presence made her wanting feel whole and complete with love and affection?
She prevented herself from acting out her stupid desire by opening the door and slipping in. She quickly closed it before the urge to throw herself back into Sebastian's arm got the better of her. Then she rested her back against the frame and closed her eyes, a smiled about her lips.
