Hey there. I just wanted to say a little bit about my groups background just so you know who's who in the pics.
This pic is me being a weirdo.And yes I wuv pandas and kitties so I thought... Why not put them together? Panda+kitty= pandachu!
Anyways... That was a little off topic. Eh?
You can call me Ally. I'm the one who started the group because mainly being I was bored and I wanted to try something new.
I cosplay as-Zero from VampireknightSoul from SouleaterItachi from NarutoKagura from Fruitsbasket And my newest cosplay is tenten from Naruto.
Tori on the other hand is my best friend, she doesn't cosplay much yet but for now she's our camera girl. In some pics she has short red hair.
Next is Kai. She cosplays as Blair from Souleater and soon to be Kyo from Fruitsbasket.
