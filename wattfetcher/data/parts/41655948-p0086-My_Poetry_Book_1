The world reminds me of you
In the sense that both you and the world
Are beautiful beyond description.
I'd be drowning in the middle of the dark ocean
If you hadn't saved me.
And if you've read my poetry,
You'd kbow I'm that 'dark ocean.
You saved ne me from myself
And you've given me a forever
Within the small space of time
We've gotten so far.
But there are days to come;
Suns to display themselves across the early morning horizon,
Stars that will shine through our beloved darkness,
There's more 'forever' within our deep, loving,
Poetic souls.
I write poetry to fill the empty pages,
But what about the empty spaces?
Where ink cannot stain itself onto the blank spots in my mind?
You fill them.
You also help me fill the empty pages,
Where poetry is to be written.
You inspire every creative side there use to me
And one is at their best when creativity consumes them.
