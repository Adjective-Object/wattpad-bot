Some people think if they're going to Heaven or Hell. Some will possibly go to Hell for senseless reasons.          Aries is a TV lover. They do they're shopping by buying whatever they find about that show. One day when Aries was shopping, she found something she loved. An action figure of her favorite anime character. Until, when Libra saw it. Libra went up to get it. Then Aries lost herself. She chased Libra up and down the mall. Aries went up to a security guard and took his gun. Aries shot Libra and Libra tazed Aries until she was no longer about. Neither of them did get that figure.         Taurus, Leo, and Virgo had a fundraiser at their church. They were all good people. Although Taurus went a little happy crazy at some points. One of them was also Pisces. She was friends with an Aquarius and a Sagittarius. They were ready for Fourth of July. They were setting up fireworks. As Pisces was eating pizza and Sagittarius was playing Clash of Clans, they didn't realize that Aquarius was lighting the fireworks. She was facing them the wrong way by accident, and she accidentally set the church on fire. Pisces went up to Heaven along with Taurus, Leo, and Virgo. But as for Aquarius and Sagittarius they were going to hell for setting a church on fire.      Capricorn on the other hand will go to Heaven.  But then possibly be sent to hell for stabbing Leo for eating her oreos.       "Why do we always get the people like this?" Gemini said to Scorpio. Since they were both Satan they were got all the people in hell."They are like us." Scorpio said Gemini."Yep....just like us." Gemini said as Aries was chasing Aquarius with a torch flame.
