Anymore...anymore...and I might just go...insane...
"Poppet...go." Oliver said.
"H-Huh?"
"I'll allow you to leave. You may go." he said.
"But m-my parents a--"
"If...If you promise me to not tell the 'First Players' about us...I'll protect them." he shrugged.
I wiped the tears from my eyes. "Ollie..."
"You won't be able to go out through that door, follow me..." he said, motioning me towards the other side of the room.
He led me to the mirror. It was the same mirror that Flavio was admiring himself in front of a while back.
Oliver waved his hands and a flash of light brightened the room for a short moment. After that, our reflection disappeared, to be replaced by...a view of...
"Oliver...that's...the bathroom on the first floor, right..?" I asked.
He nodded. "Through this mirror, you'll be transported there. The 'First Player' Italy is in the room across the fireplace room of the second floor. Don't go there directly. Find the other 'First Players' before doing that because Allen and the others are on the second floor, too. Avoid them at all costs. Just do your best to quietly go to where the other 'First Players' are. "
"I...T-Thanks...but why...are you doing this...?"
"...Well...what are...friends for, poppet?" he said, a hint of sadness in his voice.
I hugged him. "...Ollie," I gave him a thankful smile and continued, "what about you? Won't they...get mad?"
He winced a bit. "Well...I suppose I can handle it. Besides," he pulled away from the hug and give a wink, "they told me not to let you out through the door. They didn't say anything about a mirror."
I gave a soft chuckle, as did he.
I turned to the mirror and touched it...my hands started to pass through it.
Then, I remembered my bag. I scanned the room and spotted it in the corner. It seemed a bit lighter than it was, maybe they took away some of the refreshments. I looked at the mirror again and turned to Oliver. "Thanks...Ollie."
"Don't mention it, poppet. ....Take care."
"....You, too."
At that, I walked through the mirror.
