"Mom I'm scared" I mumbled. I looked over at my mom who was smiling brightly.
"It'll be okay. This is a good school. Now go and make some friends." She hugged me then made the shooing motion with her hand. I sighed then got out of the car and waved good bye.
My new school was massive. It was the third high-school I had been to in one semester. My dad is in the army and my mom is in the Navy so, I move around a lot.
I pulled out the schedule I had gotten the day before. Classes started in ten minutes.
First task of the day: find my locker.
I went through a pair of doors and glanced around. I was in the right hallway. Just too low on numbers.
"Fourty four...fourty five...fourty six...ah-ha! Fourty seven!" I mutteted outloud. I bent down to reach it then looked at my schedule again.
16-23-7
I pulled the locker open. "Look at that fucking emo." I heard someone say. My cheeks went red with embarrassment and I quickly shoved my text books into my locker then closed it.
I looked down at my schedule saw my first period.

I tried to get there fast but someone stopped me. "Looky here. Another fag " I got shoved. I kept looking down at my feet.
"We'll see you around faggot." They knocked my books out of my hands and I sighed. I was kind of use to this. People can be assholes.
"Need help?" I heard someone ask. I looked up and saw an amzingly beautiful guy. He bent down and helped me gather my papers and my notebooks.
"Th-Thank you." I mumbled. Quickly I scurried off. The boy tried getting my attention but I didnt want to be late on my first day.
