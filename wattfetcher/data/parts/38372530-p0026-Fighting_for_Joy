I know she went back to school to get her degree in business law but of course, I wasn't thinking about that.
"I'm sorry pooh. I honestly wasn't thinking. Forgive me please?" I asked her and she nodded.
"Yes I forgive you babe. As long as you promise to be more understanding. Sex is a big part of a relationship but it's not that big." She said after I nodded and kissed my lips softly.
"I love you babe." I told her and she smiled.
"I love you too." She said and kissed me again biting her lip as she came up for air. "I think I'm ready now."
"Is that so." I asked her moving my hand up and down her thigh and she nodded.
"Yes."
With that, I got up from the dinner table and scooped her up. Tonight will be a good night.
