Keegan's POV
"Cameron I have practice at twelve to three." I told him he nods, "and it's 11:30." I said he stood up quickly then fell to the floor that's what his dizzy butt gets.
I quickly changed into my practice clothes, my phone case has always been a softball sometimes I'd change it out when I'm cheering. "The guys are already up and ready, I hope you are ready for Jordan to come." Cameron said, "Can I sit in the front?" I asked, "Nash wants to." He said I sighed rolling my eyes getting a water bottle and drinking a glass of water.
I walk into the living room, with my phone and text my best friends Mason and Riley.
M❤️😂😏-what's up love
R😂😈❤️-what's up babes
K-Nothing much are you going to practice
R😂😈❤️-Yessssssss
M❤️😂😏-I wish I could watch but my parents are out on a cruise and told me to do my chores
"Keegan come on." Cameron said I nodded standing up, I grabbed my water bottle out the freezer and walked outside sitting far away from Jordan and Hayes
"Who are you texting?" Cameron asked, "People." I said, "Don't get an attitude because I didn't let you sit in the front." he said, "I wasn't- I'm not even gonna say anything." I said, "No tell me what you were gonna say?" Cameron asked me, "I wouldn't want to talk to you right now because I would just be waisting my breath." I said putting on my teal beats.
I played my music then felt my headphones being snatched off, "What is your problem?" I asked Hayes, "Nothing, I just wanted to know what you were listening to." He chuckled, "I hate you." I whispered luckily he didn't hear me I put my beats back on until we made it there.
I grabbed my softball stuff then walked to the field, "Hey." Riley said, "Hey." I said grabbing a ball for us to throw together, "Pop flies?" I asked her she nodded and I threw the ball up in the air and she caught it.
"She probably can't catch." Hayes said to Jordan. Riley did the same to me and I caught them to prove Hayes wrong, "Alright lets start hitting girls." our coach said, "Keegan you first show them what you've got." I grabbed my helmet and bat running to the batter spot.
She pitched the ball and I swung the first time, "Keegan we aren't running so just hit and after Riley hits you guys and throw again." she said I nodded then I swung again hitting it to the out field, I did the same except hit it out the park.
"Good job, go get some water and Riley come on!" Coach said, Riley did the same thing as me but hit farther. The sun was beaming hot and I couldn't take it, I flipped my shirt halfway up showing my toned abs.
I walk to Cameron and grab my water, "Thanks Dallas." I said, "You're welcome Dallas." He said, I walked back and threw with Riley.
----------two hours later
By now all the girls were in sports bras, and Nike shorts. "Alright girls that's a wrap we have a game next week on Wednesday, try to be there, if not give me a call." she said we all nodded and we put our sweaty hands in, "Heat on me heat on three one two three heat!" We all yelled, I grabbed my phone, bag, shirt and water then walked to Cameron again, "Put that shirt on." Cameron said, "No it's too hot." I said.
"Cause I'm out here." Nash said I scoffed and he playfully glared at me, "Wanna play football when we get home?" Nash asked us I nodded, "I can't I- have to clean up the house." Jordan said.
I chuckled, "What's funny about that?" She asked me, "You stuttering, you're hiding something, come on tell us." I said smiling, "H-Hayes don't believe her." She stuttered again, "What are you hiding?" He asked, "Im cheating on you." She mumbled, "Thanks for being honest." he said after about five minutes.
