It was almost 5 P.M and I was walking to the coffee-shop the meet Michael. it was raining, a lot. But not even that was going to stop me from meeting Michael. I was so excited. Not only was I going to Michael's place for the first time, I was going to see a movie based on one of my favorite books.
When I was just about a 15 min walk away, I got a text message, from Michael. I walked into a cafè and read it;
"Hey Lilith! I'm so sorry, I have to take another short shift (maybe 2 hours) for a co-worker :( Still up for tonight though? Love. Mikey xx"
I frowned, but understood. And besides, I could always finish reading the book, right? I replied with a short "Ok, I understand. I'll be there at 7" with a smile emoji at the end.
I went over to the woman behind the cash-register and ordered a black coffee and a slice of cheesecake. I sat down in a corner and pulled out my book, but didn't open it. I took the coffee-cup in both of my hands, regaining some of the warmth that washed away in the rain.
My eyes started wandering all over the place, looking at the people I was sharing air with. Mostly old people or business people, typing away at their computers. But at the other side of the room, directly across of me, was a couple making out. I grimaced, and looked judging at them. I don't have anything against them as people. I'm happy for them, I really am. But just don't make out in public.
"You look like you just saw someone kick a puppy." a dark Aussie accent spoke from the table beside mine. The voice belonged to a guy with loads of tattoo's. An I mean loads, his body was covered in them. "Have you ever seen someone who have seen someone kick a puppy?" I asked, taking a sip of my coffee. "No, but I imagine that they would like the same as you just did." His voice was kinda raspy, kinda like when you've smoked cigarettes for a while.
The tattoo guy was drinking the same as me, plain black coffee. But he was doing something on his phone instead of reading.
He locked his phone, put it down and turned to face me "Are you gonna explain why you looked at them like that or am I hoping for too much?" the guy asked, offering me to take a seat across of him. I picked up my book and did. "Well, if you buy me another cup of coffee, I might just tell you." I suggested, and the boy smiled before muttering a quick "I'll be right back".
He came a minute later with two steaming hot cups of coffee in his hands. "Thank you," I smiled gratefully and took the cup, bringing it to my lips.
"So..." he said, nodding his head towards the two 'lovebirds' on the other side of the cafè. "Are you going to tell me what that was all about?" I sighed and put the coffee-cup down. "It just reminded me of someone I used to know. Nothing big." I shrugged, dragging my finger across the edge of the cup.
"Now that's just boring! I was hoping for some deep shit." he exclaimed. First now i let myself take in his features. he had big brown eyes, and perfect olive skin, decorated with words and pictures. His hair was black with some blonde streaks in it, styled up in a quiff.
"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, whatever your name is." I chuckled, and so did he. "I'm sorry, how rude of me. I'm Calum" he reached his hand out for me to shake. "Lilith" I replied with a smile. "What a noteworthy name" he grinned.

We got lost in the conversation, In fact I almost forgot that I was going to hang out with Michael."So, I guess you have to leave now.:" Calum said, catching my attention again. "What? Why?" I asked confused. He just laughed and pointed at the clock that hung on the wall. "You said you were meeting someone at 7, right? Well, It's 6.45 now so..." he trailed off, scratching the back of his head. "Yeah, I almost forgot." I nervously laughed before standing up. I put on my coat and grabbed the book, putting it back in the pocket.
"Bye Calum" I smiled before turning around to leave. "Lilith, wait!" Calum called after me, bringing me to a halt. I turned around again and saw him reaching out his phone. "Save your number, please? I would love to talk to you again sometime." I was astonished, that someone like him would enjoy my company. "Alright" I said and took his phone, typing in my number and saving it as a new contact. "Thanks" he smiled. "No problem" I mimicked the smile and headed towards the door. "One more thing," he said, grabbing my arm. "Whoever you're seeing... I hope he treats you right."
