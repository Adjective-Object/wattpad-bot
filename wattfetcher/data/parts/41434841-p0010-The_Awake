Yeah. This isn't really a good day. Panic attacks. They're just. Super. It feels kind of like my ribs turned in on me, like they're stabbing my lungs. There's a pain in my side. And my head is going fuzzy. It feels nice but I hate it. It means I'm losing the awake. I don't want to lose the awake. I need to find a way to keep it.
I need help.
I don't want it.
I don't want it at all.
But we learn that a need outweighs a want. Funny isn't it.
I just need to leave everyone. I don't need any friends.
