'Eurgh.' Max groaned, thinking about the pain in her body. 'Life would be better if I was a guy.' she complained. She stood up from her bed and checked her phone. 'Yo, Maximus Cauliflower! What's up?' It was from Chloe, even if Max somehow couldn't recognise her deep, raspy voice she'd have known it was Chloe just by her nicknames; nicknames were always a Chloe thing. 'Im just casually dying, y'know.' Max answered. 'Woah man, what's wrong?' Chloe suddenly became more serious, Max could hear the concern in her voice. 'Just cramps, I get them pretty bad.' Max said wincing at the small surge of pain. 'Sheesh. Well, considering my poor Max is in distress, I'm gunna be the knight in shining armour. Stay there, don't die. I'll be there in 20!' Chloe assured. 'What are you doing?' Max laughed. 'You'll just have to fucking wait and see!' Chloe said slipping out a small laugh at the end. Although Max couldn't see Chloe, she could tell that Chloe was wearing her regular, sassy smirk on her face. The same smirk that for unknown reasons made Max's stomach do flips. Max brushed away the feeling as Chloe and Max said their short term goodbyes and ended their call.
Around 15 minutes later, Max was still sprawled across her bed tangled in a mess of blankets and listening to her regular Indie based music as she heard a knock on the door, making her come back into reality after spacing out and finally getting up to answer the door. 'Hurry up and answer the door Max, you won't get your surprise otherwise!' Chloe laughed as Max reached the door and let the blue haired girl stood outside into her small, messy room.'You're rooms pretty messy, for a good girl.' Chloe laughed throwing a shirt on the sofa over to Max's bed whilst laying onto the sofa. 'Its what happens when you're busy with your face stuck in text books about photography all day.' Max said wrapping back to into her bed. 'I'm guessing you don't want to see your surprise then?' The punk girl teased waving a bag in front of her. 'Depends, what is it?' Max leaned up. 'You'll have to come over here and find out, Maxi pad.' Chloe laughed. 'Thats one nickname I don't like...' The freckled girl chuckled. 'I don't know whether I have the effort to come over there.''Guess I'll just keep the surprise.' She said nonchalantly. 'Woah no, not fair Chloe!' 'Come here then.' 'Make me.' Max said laying back under her covers when suddenly, she felt the weight of the other girl jump on to her. 'I'll fucking tickle you, Caulfield!' Chloe shouted reaching down to the other girls sides and laughing to herself. Chloe has always used Max's weakness to tickling against her.'St-stop it-' Max said through her giggling. 'Never! The Chloenator will always succeed!' Chloe shouted tickling the girl beneath her more than before. 'N-no!' Max replied in fits of laughter. Max had an idea, and it was actually a risky idea, this could either end badly or end okay... But Max knew she could always rewind. 'N-not this time!' Max challenged in a more daring attitude then she would on a regular basis as she took a breath and leaned up throwing her arms around Chloe's shoulder and pressing her lips onto her. Max noted how surprisingly soft Chloe's lips were on hers, and the faint taste of cigarettes lingering on her lips. It's not like this was the first time they'd kissed, or the second, or even the forth... When they were younger they practised kissing for the future relationships (which Max still has little experience of) they might have, and they practised quite a lot. At first Chloe was still and shocked, but she soon returned the favour and kissed back. Chloe kissed differently to how Max remembered, she was rough but good, no, not good, great at it. Max knew this meant she'd been kissing someone else since Max left, the idea of that made Max's stomach drop and instant jealousy arise. Max had come to terms with her feelings for Chloe in the last few days, she was falling in love with her. She knew she couldn't feel this way because they were best friends and Chloe probably didn't even like her that way, but it didn't stop the way Max looked at Chloe or the feeling small touches from Chloe gave her. Sometimes Max even say Chloe look at her the same way, she'd catch her staring or find her stumble to recover after moments that seemed more intimate than others, and it gave Max hope. They'd been kissing for a few moments now, and Max knew she should probably stop for both her dignity and for the sake of their friendship but Max secretly wanted to carry on, she knew she shouldn't want to because it could potentially ruin their friendship, but a part of her was being greedy and kept kissing. A few moments later Chloe broke the kiss to catch some air. 'Well,' Chloe smirked looking flustered, 'you were right...' She laughed. 'About what?' Max replied as casually as possible hiding her blush.'That did make me stop tickling you.' 'Sorry Chloe I didn't mean to- I didn't want to surprise you, I uh just thought it would work.' Max apologised, stumbling on words and now becoming somewhat embarrassed and fearful that she'd annoyed Chloe with her surprising action. 'Shut up you dork!' Chloe said ruffling Max's hair. 'Besides, If I'm honest, I was kinda hoping you'd kiss me sometime.' Chloe laughed. 'I've missed it.' She smiled a genuine smile, not one of her fake ones where she pretends she's okay, a real one. 'Me too.' Max smiled back, hearing Chloe say that made Max's heart jump and filled her with blush. 'Anyway, so are you totally fucking hella excited for my surprise?' 'Actually I kinda forgot about it, but let me see!' 'Well too fucking bad, because you have to convince me to give it to you!' Chloe laughed. With that Max moved closer to Chloe and leaned into the side of Chloe's face. 'I'll give you free kisses.' Max whispered and kissed her cheek in a hope she could grab as much of Chloe's attention as possible. 'You're being daring today Maximus, are you sure those cramps aren't doing crazy stuff to you?' She laughed. 'But I'm not giving up that offer!' She said jumping off the bed and running to bag she had originally brought in.'I got you ice cream, chocolate, pizza and movies... Yeah I know, I love me too.' Chloe laughed. 'You're a life saver.' Max agreed. The two girls spend the rest of the day inside eating, watching movies and undeniably making out. A lot. Just for old times sake.
