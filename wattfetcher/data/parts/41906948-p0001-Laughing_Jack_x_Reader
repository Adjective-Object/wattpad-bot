Little's (y/n)'s POV
I was going to be Five years old!! I can't wait what my parents got me for my birthday! I hope it's a pony! My mom told me that nobody was coming to my party. I don't have any friends at all. Like always nobody would come to my birthday party... " Sighs" "honey come down here please!" I heard my mother yell from downstairs. "Coming mother!" I ran down the stairs as fast as my little legs ran. " Mommy you called me?" "Yes (y/n), me and your father have something for you." "Ohh really what is it!" I saw my dad holding a rainbow box. "Um.. Mommy, daddy what is that colorful box?" " Honey this is your present from us. It's a Laughing Jack in a box." "Oh la la~ it's pretty!" My dad bended down to my height level and handed me the box. "Thank you mommy and daddy!" "Your welcome honey" my daddy said. "Why don't you go upstairs and play with the box?" My mommy said to me. "Yes!" I ran upstairs and closed the door.
