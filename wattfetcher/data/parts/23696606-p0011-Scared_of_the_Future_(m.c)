As I unlocked the apartment-door, I kicked my shoes off and hung my jacket on the clothing-rack. Ashton did the same and followed me into the living.room. "Mi casa es su casa. I'm gonna take a shower to get the hospital smell out of my hair. Just hook up the PS4 in the meantime. Games are in the drawer to the left." Ashton widened his eyes and grinned at me. "Wow! i take back my comment in the elevator. I'll let Michael know when he comes back." I nodded and went into the bathroom.

I took a towel and wrapped it around my body tightly. I dried myself and put on the undergarments ans clothes I had picked out beforehand, and brushed my wet hair. As I was doing so, I noticed a weird yellow-ish dust on the edge of the sink. I started coughing and put my hand over my mouth. My throat felt like the Sahara desert. I pulled my hand away and looked at it. It was full of the dust-thingy. I grimaced as I felt the horrible smell coming from it. I wiped my hands and exited the bathroom.
"C'mon, C'mon, C'mon!" I heard Michael's voice yell from the living-room, signaling that he was back. I walked in to see Ashton kicking Michael's ass in Halo. "You're playing it wrong, you know?" I laughed as I took a seat in between them. "Oh shut your mouth. My way is the right way. Ashton is cheating!" Michael whined, pausing the game, looking at me. "Hey!" Ashton exclaimed, irritated. "Ok, I guess. Now, let me play!" I couldn't help but laugh as I took the controller out of Michael's hands.
The gaming continued with me taking Michael's place, and owning Ashton. "Where'd you learn to play like that?" he asked, clearly surprised. "I used to play with my half-brother." I explained, only to be met with another question. "Used to?" Michael asked. I sighed and put away my controller. looking down at my lap. "He was killed a few years back." The room grew silent, and I felt Michael's hand at my knee. "I'm so sorry." he said, and it sounded like he really meant it.
I was just about to answer him, when my phone started ringing. I picked it up from the table and felt my heartbeat slow down as I saw the caller ID. My had shook as I swiped the screen, picking up. My breath shook as well, but the boys didn't seem to notice as they started up a new game. My voice was small when I greeted the person in the other end. "H-hi Calum."
