Talented.Joyful.Perfect.
Not a single thing are youFor thy makes these words anew.
Shall your breath on my shoulderEnd all but one troubleLove.
Eyes of steel,Eyes of glassAs softJust as brass.
Speechless you have me,Your finger bent is my willThe game we playAll but a killFor a kill is what is sold.If that is must endOther than to grow oldBe it with youAnd no one else shall be told.
Hands soft as cloud,Beauty as breathtaking as deer,Can end the cloak of a shroudAnd set into a lureOf love.
Trapped am I,But by goddess.I am fed by hand,Spoiled to the boneFor your love isAs fresh as a grapePicked off vine.
Wary my wordsShan't I repeat them:You are grapeAs I am stemSeparated Yet boundAs an ownerTo his hound.
