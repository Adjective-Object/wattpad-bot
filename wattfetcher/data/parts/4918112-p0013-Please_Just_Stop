And yes, I just went Greek Mythology on your ass. Deal with it.
In conclusion, your arguments are about as weak as your stories. Seriously. Like LovelyLonelyStars has said, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. So if you don't like my harsh reality, I got two words for you.
Too. Bad.
Take my criticism like the mature person you could be. Honestly, I gave it to you because you need it. And if you've never gotten criticism before, then you're welcome for bringing you home from Wonderland. We've missed you in reality.
And if you're going to start crying, then I will have no problem in convicing Rin to run you over. The world needs less robotic hyenas and more sensible humans.
And if you insist on starting a war with me, then you can rest assured that you will not win. I guarantee it.
For those of you would like to SENSIBLY argue with me, I will give you a fair shot and listen. This doesn't mean that I will agree with you, but I will see what you have to say and MAYBE we can come to an agreement.
But for those of you who start your own rant in the comments section below and expect me to remove this entry because you've "shown me the light" (more like the dark side of your ass), you've got another thing coming.
