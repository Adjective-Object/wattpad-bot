After a few exchanges of words, it seems that a short silence fell upon the two countries near me. It can't be helped, they were talking about a very sensitive topic. I know it's wrong to eavesdrop, but this is important. They are talking about him, after all. Moments later, Italy broke the silence.





"...France, can I ask you something? If there was someone I didn't want to forget me again...what should I do?





If you forgot about me and asked me, 'Who are you?' what should I do?" Italy asked.




((Then you'd know how Canada feels. //shot.))




France rolled his eyes.  "Well, your...ass...er, no, no." he stopped, realising that this wasn't the time for making jokes. It was serious.





"You've been breaking a lot clocks and getting your memories back. If it's too much and they can't all fit in...what if you turn out like me and lose your memories?" Italy asked, his lips trembling.




France smiled and pat Italy's shoulder. "...You must remember him."






"What?" Italy tilted his head.





Taking a deep breath, France spoke, "You're the one who knows from experience what it is like to forget something you don't want to forget, right? It's sad, but we'll definitely forget something."





"Yeah." Italy nodded.





Smiling, France continued,  "Then you must remember him, so that he will be able to remember you again. You've been remembering us so far, so we also started remembering little by little.
