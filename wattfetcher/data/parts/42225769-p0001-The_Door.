One week before the engagement.
Yandera's POV.
"Yandera!" My sister yelled as she ran into my room. She was so annoying. I swear I have a friend over for heavens sake.
"Hey little stack!" Ckellea, my friend said. "Hi, oh Yandera" I stopped her in her stupid smiling tracks. "How dare you! Ya can't just come in here and expect me to want to play! Your making me sound like a monster!!!" I shrieked.
She started to get red and tear up. "I... I .... Jjjjuuusssttt hhadd too telllll yyyooouuu...." She began to stutter. "Dinners ready..." She finished and ran out of the room. I felt bad but not to bad she was annoying and ignorant. "Your so harsh I swear!" Ckellea said flipping her arms up and ran out of the room to go comfort Henidiey.
Oops... Well she fucking deserved it, she is always disturbing me while I have my friends over. Too bad she's crying boohoo. Blahblahblah. She's just a drama queen. "Are we going or not?" My other friend Penniea asked.
A/ N this part was probably terrible but who cares it's the first of many p.s I will leave pictures of the characters in the media boxes. Also in the next chapter your gonna see Gorgie.
