I'll still miss you, there's no going home, there's no turning back.
It was a blow to the chest like gunfire, it left my eyes welling with tears and my mind full of the thoughts I tried so hard to disable.
You can't come back now.
My trust is such a trivial thing. It's gone now, good riddance.
All this time I've been chasing down a lie, a false fantasy that I will never be a part of.
That pretend idea is so much prettier than the truth.
I'll still miss you, but don't ever come back.
