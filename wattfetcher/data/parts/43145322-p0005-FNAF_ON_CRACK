Chica: BRING IT HUN
Toy Chica: I can eat faster than I can rap. *raps Eminem's 'rap god' in two minutes*
Freddy: DAAAAAAAMN
A.A: you guys have seen how much I eat, right?
Author-chan: yes. And because I might be the spawn of Satan, I'm going to make you guys not eat anything for twenty four hours before the contest.
A.A, Chica, and Toy Chica: NUUUUUUUUUUU
Author-chan: I can and will say the b-word. (Butts)
