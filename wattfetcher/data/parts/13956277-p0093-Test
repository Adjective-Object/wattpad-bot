I ran back upstairs before any of them could see me. I keot talking and laughing with Nina and other little girls, then Nina's sister came in, "We need to talk" She dragged me out of the room, "Please dont take Nina" The girl collapsed in front of me, she knelt and started kissing my feet, "What are you doing ? Get up" I pulled her up and hugged her, "Please let her stay" She begged, "Your five minutes are over, get out" The ugly woman said, "You want money ? Here you go" I threw 100 dollars at her, she took the money and whispered something to Nina's sister then left.
"What's wrong?" I asked her 3 more times before she opened her mouth, "If you're not one of them, help us" She sobbed, "GET OUT" The woman shouted, "If you want to help us come tomorrow at 5" Nina's sister whispered then the woman pushed me out.
I was driving slowly with my brain busy in imaginig and thinking of what was going on in that orphanage, but I couldn't go home, I still got some work to do.
I stopped in front of a flower shop and asked for some colourful flowers and a card, "I'm sorry, Leena" I wrote, then went to a market and brought a box of snickers, We are rich ! Who cares about money ?
I knocked on the door twice then a womam im her 40s opened the door, "Hi" She said, "Hi, are Molly and Simon here ?" I asked, "Yes they are, you are the girl that Simon set up a birthday party for, right ?", "Yes Ma'am" I blushed then walked into the house and sat on the couch, "MOLLY, SIMON, YOUR PRETTY MUSLIM FRIEND IS HERE" Simon came running down but Molly didn't, "Hi" I said, "Hi" waved at me, "Uh, I-I .... I'm sorry" I gave him the flowers. He stood there speechless, "That's nice of you, but what are you sorry for?" His mother asked, "Uh .... for burning him", "ARE YOU CRAZY ! HE ALMOST GOT BLINDED", "I-I'm sorry, that's why I came, I also brought some chocolate", "Calm down mom, It's fine, it was an accident" Simon defended me, "YOU WERE-", "MOM, I said its fine, can you leave us alone ?" She left. "You didnt have to do this" He smiled at me, he looked like a little child that his parents bought a toy for, you could see happiness jumping out of him, "I know I didn't, but Molly scolded me and made me feel of how big was the thing I've done, so here am I, asking for your forgiveness. You haven't been anything but nice to me" I saw him blushing with his shown half, "I'm sorry, I cant forgive you" My eyes widened at him, "What ?", "I cannot forgive you, its not as simple as that!" I glared at him, "What do you want ?", "As you see, my right hand is burnt and I cant write" He smiled, "I get it, give me your homework" I sighed, I heard his devilish laugh as he was climbing the stairs, I went to Molly's room and got in because I knew that she wont open, "Didn't they teach you thst you shall knock?" I ran and hugged her, "Come on ! You can't stay mad at me, you love me, plus, I brought flowers and chocolate to Simon, but then gave the chocolate to your mother since she was about to pull my hair" Molly laughed out loud, "Simon, do you forgive her ?" Molly asked, "Not yet, after she does my homework", "OKAY" I said loudly and Molly laughed.
We sat in the living room, I was solving math problems for Simon and he was looking at me, "You look funny", "Shut up" I said, "Next" I said then he gave me his English homework, Molly was watchimg TV beside us.
