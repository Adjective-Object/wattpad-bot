A/N: Yes, I know. The dancing part was kind of confusing to imagine in your minds. At least I would think so. In order to give you guys more of an idea of what it looked like, I posted a video next to the side of the chapter. I used some parts as a reference while writing. Subtract all the acrobatic stuff, and that's kind of what it looked like. The picture on the side was pretty much what the ceremony room looked like if you were to add chairs and tables and, y'know...people.
