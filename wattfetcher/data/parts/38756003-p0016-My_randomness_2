please say I am not dreaming but In only 21 hours I have 99 reads on my book!! how?????? pinch meh plz...... but really what is going on?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!? how? from about 60 to almost 100 in 21 hours?? I know its not much but to me its everything I have ever wanted. I am going through some family problems and I am kinda refusing to call my moms sister my aunt but you guys probably don't care much. what should I do for my 100 reads thingy plz comment I will try to combine all of your ideas unless its info about me that is personal or seeing me irl for now but plz comment any ideas and give me feedback on my writing I can take harsh things; like I have not from my sister yet about me. two funny things, my family don't know about this wattpad account thingy only my friends @elsasings1237 and @fuzzycat2022 know about this. second thing is IF YOU LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT THEN DON'T READ ON!!!! but if you don't like her like me then I will tell you something that happened while I was talking to my friend on kik. we were talking about songs that we like and the topic got on Taylor swift and it went like this:
me: there's everyone else inÂ my class 'OMG Taylor Swift is sooo amazing'
then there's me' what the fudge is your problem with that girl, she is dating guys, and breaking up with them and saying 'OMG they broke up with me and so now I have to write a song about how people should feel bad for me'
friend: lol the fudge
me: you hate her too?
friend: yass she won two awards in the last awards show

and it went on from there me talking about Sam Smith and stuff like that. well, this is Angel and I will see all you Halo's later byee:) (p.s. srry for making it sooooo long)
