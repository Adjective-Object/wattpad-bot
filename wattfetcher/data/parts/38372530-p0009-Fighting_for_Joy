"That's my only daughter and my whole heart. She has got to be okay." She said in a low voice.
I nodded again. "I feel your pain. I'm just trying to keep my head up while I'm here. I need you alls support."
"I'm sorry Devin. I never even asked how you felt sweetheart. How are you? Are you okay?" She asked and I sighed.
"I'm holding up. I know my baby is a fighter." I said
"She is." She nodded and chuckled.
"Well you and Mr. Carter can start making your way here to see the new grand baby." I said changing the topic.
"We are gonna be there in less than twenty." She said and we hung up.
"Baby." I called out to Lauren as I came into the house.
"Yes?" She asked from the kitchen
"How you feeling pooh?" I asked her seeing her standing up at the sink.
She nodded. "Good. Pregnant but good."
I smiled. "I'm glad you're happy. I can't wait until the baby is here." I told her as I held onto her waist.
She rocked back and forth. "I can't wait either. To hold our little healthy baby in our hands." She said smiling. "It's gonna be beautiful."
I nodded. "It will be." I said and kissed her lips.
"I love you Mr. Thomas." She told me and turned around into my arms so that we faced each other.
I smiled and kissed her lips passionately. "I love you too Mrs. Thomas."
I can't help but smile at the memory. Pooh would talk about us holding the baby in our hands. Seeing him or her for the first time and how priceless the moment would be. I'm not going to let that moment go. Her and i will have that moment. Together just like she wanted it to be, and it will be perfect.
"Hey Devin." Jeremy said as he came by cars and I who had fallen asleep in my lap.
"Hey man. What's up?" I said as we stood up and greeted each other.
"Nothing man. Erin is too emotional to come here right now. He just wanted me to bring you some food and to take Cara off of your hands. We have the kids with us." He said as he grabbed Cara's coat.
"Thanks man." I said taking the bag of food and placing it next to my seat.
"No problem. How you holding up?" He asked and I shook my head.
"I'm trying man." I said.
"I know what you mean man." He shook his head. "Look you know we love Lauren. What every you need." He said and I nodded.
"Thank you. Just please get baby girl in the bed. I don't want her to be here any longer." I said.
He nodded. "You've got it man. How are they?" He asked.
"The baby is in NICU and nothing about Lauren." I said.
"Everything will be fine." He told me and I nodded.
"Thanks man." I said and shook his hand.
After a few minutes of talking he left. I saw that Kelsey and Jacob were calling but I just sent them to voicemail and shot them a text of the hospital address.
"Hey." Someone said as I sat with my head in my hands.
I looked up to see Taylor I sighed. "Yes Taylor." I asked.
