My throat burns. I don't know if it's from all the cigarettes or vomiting. I need to figure out how to fix this. I wish I could take so many things back. Like saying I never wanted Ryan back. That's not true. I want him back. It was just simpler than saying "I won't be ready any time soon". No matter how much I want him I just can't have him around. I'll hurt him. I'll mess something up. I'll make him feel bad. Just. I'll do something and I'll ruin it. His goodbye hurt but I let it sit and fester and it got worse. God it got worse. I made myself a monster. When in reality I couldn't stop him from saying goodbye. I don't really know if he wants me to never speak to him again or he just needed time and now I guess I never will know because I told him I didn't want him back. He was kind of a balance. He helped. I'd talk to him and life seemed to disappear. I was just happy. Simply happy. I loved moments like that. I miss them. I'm not sure if I miss him or just memories of him. I'm pretty sure it's him. Who knows though. I wish I could take back when I broke the mirror. I wish I could take back all the useless fights I got into. I wish I could take back this whole year. It's been a mess. I want my old life back. The happy one. I want to feel happy. Purely happy. But I don't know how to get there.
