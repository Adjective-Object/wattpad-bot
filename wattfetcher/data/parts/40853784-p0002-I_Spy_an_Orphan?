"Hey guys!" I bend down the eye level of the twins to ruffle their dark chocolate hair. A slight smile comes on my face while Josh and Amy look at me curiously. "Edie" Amy asks, but John finishes, "Are you sad?" My eyes slide from the 5 year old twins to Mrs. Grange in the living room. "Nope. I'm dandy!" I plaster a fake grin on my face; my cheeks begin to hurt in my attempt to cheer up the kids.
"Come on guys. It's time to go." I slide the twin's hand-me down plain backpack's off of the scratched up kitchen table. As Cassie and the twins head to the front door, I search for an unexpired breakfast food that has managed to avoid the twin's destruction. Digging through the pantry, I feel a slight tug on my Walmart brand shirt and turn around. Daniel is looking up at me with his big brown eyes as he holds up the last package of toaster pastries.
"They're blueberry, your favorite. I hid them for you." Daniel quietly says. I bend down to the four year old's height and take the food from his small artistic hands. Giggling, I wipe some leftover washable paint from yesterday off of his chin. "Thanks Danny. That was really nice of you." The shy green-eyes boy in front of me gives me his best gap-toothed smile and sings, "Happy Birthday!!" I walk to the fool with him holding my hand sighing, "Yup. Best seventeen years of my life."
-----Author's Note:What??Over a thousand words for my first chapter written on Wattpad?
I hope it was a good thousand words. This is my first book that I have shared with other people. I would love any criticism or typos you may have. Also if anything is confusing, please let me know!!
