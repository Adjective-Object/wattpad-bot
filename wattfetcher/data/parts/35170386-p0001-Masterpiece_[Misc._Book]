Don't you just hate when you have a nice story going, you like the opening, and lots of other people like it too, and then you have that one little illogical shit immediately trashing it?
Yes, it happened to me once upon a star (or what the hell other people say) and a friend of mine who first posted their story.
Yeah, it sucks.
But you know, if that ever happens to you, don't worry.
I'm sure the said trasher just felt threatened.
After all, I read the story, and it's great. I love it. If it happens to you, just think that they are trying to discourage you because you getting all the love makes them feel threatened.
And then here's the really funny part.
That person messaged the writer at least a month or so later, telling them that their story had 'lots of potential'.
For policy's sake, no names will be mentioned, but it certainly was a dick move.
Seriously. First you talk shit about a great story, then you try saying that it has potential? WHEN IT HAD 20+ READERS FOR EVERY CHAPTER? Really? Are you trying to get on their good side or . . . ?
People are seriously frustrating. I forgive people very quickly, because it isn't right to hold grudges, but seriously. If you're doing this, you my friend are a disgrace to society and should mediate under a cherry tree and never show your face again. To thinly veil it.
Thanks.
