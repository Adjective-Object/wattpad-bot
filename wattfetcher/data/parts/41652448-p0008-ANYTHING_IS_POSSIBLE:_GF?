Me and Zoe go back downstairs to the kitchen while Dipper watches Tv and Mabel and her friends are hanging out. But we can still hear everything. The kitchen doesn't have a door, so yeah.

TV: an entire 48 hours of ghost harassers! On the used to be about history channel!

tv:we interrupt this program to bring you breaking news!

Dipper: aw, what?!

Mabel jumps onto the side of the seat her brother is sitting in.

Mabel: it's starting!

Then Candy jumps on the other side

Candy: Turn it up!

Then Grenda jumps right on top.

Grenda: MAKE ROOM FOR GRENDA!

ON TV:
Toby Determined: well tonight's the night, but I've been out here for days. The Northwest family annual high society shindig Ball sharay is here! And even though common folk aren't let in, that won't stop us from camping out for a peek at the fanciness.

Mabel, Grenda, and Candy in unison: OOH!

Dipper: ok, could someone please explain why people care about this?

Grenda: um, it's pretty much the best party of all time. Rich food, richer boys.

Mabel: they say each gift basket has a live quill inside!

as me and Zoe walk into the living room we see Candy go up to the tv.

Candy: give me your life pacifica.

Yeesh
i thought to myself. It looked crazier for her to do that when you can actually see it in person.

Dipper: guys, in case you've already forgotten, Pacifica Northwest is the worst.

In my head I was laughing. Juts wait until he finds out. Anyways theres a knock at the door.

Dipper: and that's not just jealousy talking, I'd say that to her face.

He says as he gets the door, when he opens the door There is Pacifica Northwest standing right there. That's funny who they were just stuff about her meanwhile ya open door and she's there. Ha!

Pacifica: I need your help.

Dipper: your the worst.
