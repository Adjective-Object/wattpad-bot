I wake up hearing two voices "Jax your stupid I said wait till the full moon."a feminine voice hisses "Hey I seen her and thought 'why not'."he says, I open my eyes and try to move my hands but realized they're chained I pull but it does nothing "Morning sunshine do you who I am."the women says kneeling by me I look at her "No do I care, nope."I say she smiles "Okay she can be mean, I'm Camron I heard you had trouble with a Camreson."she says "Does it really concern you."I say she laughs "Yes honey."she says I snarl at the nickname.
"Devon clam down."Kiefer says I want to kill him so badly I pull my hands hard and the chain breaks but Kiefer and Jax hold me back "Honey clam down this is for your own good to keep you and everyone safe."Camron says I hold my breath and they reattach the chain I look at the chain "This bull."I say Kiefer looks at me "We have to do this trust me I ran."he says "Shut up Kief."Camron says I sit back against the metal and Jax looks at me "Jax can you stay while we go talk to Malcolm."Kiefer says he nods and they walk out Jax sits by me "Why did you do this."I scowl he looks at me "Because I wanted to."he says I pull my hands hard, and harder the chain snaps again and Jax puts his hand on the chain I kick him back and get up I run to the window and break it I step out on the ledge and I look over I jump down and land on my feet when Jax comes down I push him and run down the ally. I climb the ladder and look around I climb on the roof and jump to the other I climb down the fire escape and run down the street when I see Kiefer "Devon how."he says "Get her."Camron yells he runs at me and I run down the street I turn and run down into the gas station.
When someone wraps their arms around me I kick and fight but nothing works "Stop fighting."a voice says I don't recognize them "My name is Stacey I'm a Kimac and you my love are gonna die."she says I hold my breath "Kiefer."I scream and she takes off running "Devon."he yells I look at him "Kiefer."I yell he chases after her and I bring my body down and she falls on me I shake my head and look at her Kiefer picks me up and runs back to the were house he sets me down and chains me up "Look you have to stay trust me a lot of people want you dead please stay."he says and he places a kiss on my cheek and he walks out, Jax walks in and looks at me "So you met Stacey."he says I look at the window, would he just shut up "Devon why did you run."he says I look at him "I don't want to be here, I like this stupid thing I want away from you and Kiefer and everyone like you."I say he looks at me and sighs "We have to do this because tomorrow you go to school now if you would have stayed with Tiffany all of this would have never happened."he says I look at him "I left because you were there you came to the camper I had to fight a fake person who wants me dead I'm on everyone's death wish come on of course I'm leaving and mainly I was trying get away from you if you can't tell I don't like you."I say he pushes the doors open and leaves just like that when someone zips by the window I look and get scared "Jax."I yell when something slips in the window he sips around and stops right in front of me, it looks like a dog but scary and it has blood red eyes and its tall maybe up to my elbow, it looks me in the eyes "Jax."I whimper, knowing that this crazy, it growls and I freak out when Jax walks in I look at he animal it looks at Jax and stands in front of me he walks over and it attacks him I scream and Jax kicks the thing off of him he runs over to me he looks at me "I shouldn't have left."he says I push him and the thing lands on me its teeth sink into my shoulder I scream Jax pulls it off and hits it he pushes it out the window, and he runs back over to me he looks at the teeth marks now bleeding on my shoulder he looks at me "Why did you do that."he says "It was coming for you."I say he looks at me when Camron and Kiefer walk in "What happened."Kiefer says "Sove got her I'm guessing by the size it was Mia."Camron says I look at her.
"She pushed me out of the way and she got her."Jax says Kiefer looks at me "Well she saved you Mia would have killed you."Kiefer says "Your right I would have I'm here to be friends when I heard about Devon a I flipped out she's my cousin."Mia says walking in I look at her "I'm sorry I bit you, I wanted to kill Jax because he turned Dev into a werewolf that doesn't slide by very easy and to tell you they want her dead."Mia says I shutter "I have to go."she says turning back into her dog like self she runs over to me and rest her head on my head "Love you." "How."I say she looks at me and runs out "She can talk to you through brain waves."Camron says I smile and Jax looks at my shoulder "Your healed I didn't think."he says "She can't she has till midnight."Camron says.
