"We're almost there," Jade smiled, but then looked warningly to the devious teen. "And remember, don't--"
"Mention to him about his school, got it." Scott remembered already.
"Well, we're here..."
The house wasn't that big like Dakota's or Justine's, but it was just an average house.
"Nice place." Scott smiled.
"Thanks... Now, let's go in, partner." Jade smiled back.
"Umm... Right..." Scott said before going into deep thought. 'Okay, Scott... You dealt with a two-legged mutated shark who always wanted to eat ya... Surely you can handle this....' he then thought to himself, trying to remain calm.
"Grampa, I'm home, and I brought a guest!" Jade called.
"Bring him in, partner." a rough voice said.
"Okay, come on, Scott." Jade told her date.
Scott gulped and walked in.
Scott walked slowly in the house and took a deep breath and sighed, until he heard a gun shot and jumped into Jade's arms. "What was that?" he asked.
Jade smiled bashfully. "My grampa always does that to show when he's either home or if a guest is here."
"Well, is this the Scott boy y'all told me 'bout, Jade?" the older, cowboy man asked his granddaughter.
"Sure as shootin'." Jade confirmed.
"Well hello there, son," the man smiled. "I'm Tumbleweed Tex." he then laughed.
"This oughta be fun." Scott whispered.
Meanwhile, Chicken and Lightning were eating dinner while their friend was out visiting the girl of his dreams and grandfather.
"I wonder how he's doin' over there?" Chicken spoke up.
"Where did he go?" Lightning sounded confused.
Chicken gave him a look. "He's visitin' Jade's granpa, remember? Geez and I thought Lindsay had problems!"
"Now if only me and Justine were like that..."
Chicken noticed the jockette behind his friend. "Uhh... Lightning?"
"Just think, me and Justine could be like... Umm... Brianna and Trent."
"Lightning?"
"Hold on... Then me and her could go out on a romantic dinner and maybe make out!"
"Lightning!"
Will you hold on?" Lighting glared at him for interrupting. "Anyway, I heard she's a good kisser, I don't know why she's so interested in that Jo dude."
"LIGHTNING!"
"What?"
"Turn around, idiot..."
Lightning turned around and saw who was there. "Hey Jo, did you hear anything?"
Jo growled and punched him.
"Owww..." Lightning groaned, fallen from his seat. "The Lightning is okay..."
"So, how did it go?" Mike asked the boys.
"What?" Chicken asked her. "The date?"
"Yeah."
"Mike, don't you remember that we--" Dee Dee spoke up, but June nudged her to keep her quiet.
"It went better than we thought it'd be." Chicken shrugged with a smile.
"So, where is he?" Brianna asked.
"Jade invited him to meet her granpa."
"Who's her grandpa?" Ashlyn asked.
"Tumbleweed Tex."
"Not the Tumbleweed Tex." Double D sounded worried.
"The very same."
"Poor guy." Eddy frowned.
"Am I it?" Ed asked, clueless as usual.
"I'm sure he's gonna be okay," Chicken assured them. "I hope he doesn't blow it."
