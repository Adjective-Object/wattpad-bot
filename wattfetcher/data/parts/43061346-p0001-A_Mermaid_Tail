"Alana, I said no!! How many times do I have to tell you?!" my mom yelled, growing red. "But surfing is my life!!!" I yelled back. I was trying (and failing) to get my mom to let me go surfing.
"There have been increasing shark attacks!! I don't want you to get eaten up!!" she reasoned. "Whatever," I mumbled before grabbing my back pack and leaving for school.
When I got there, I went straight to my locker and tried to avoid everyone as much as possible. After I got my books, I turned around and was immediately blocked from going anywhere. Ugh.
It was Mackenzie and her little group of friends. "What do you want, Mac?" I grumbled. "Don't talk to me like that, you little bitch! I own you!" She almost screamed at me. "Sorry to break your bubble, but all you own is you, not me, not anybody else," I shot back at her like a cobra.
"You wanna see proof? Here it is. I own your ugly ass," Mac showed me a video on her phone. She caught me singing! I have been told by the few people that have heard me sing that I am great, but I don't care, I'm super shy.
"How did you get that?!" I yelled. Then my suddenly so called best friend came out from behind the group. "From me," she said. That's right, I sang for her yesterday on the way home from school. That traitor!
I tried to run away from them but they tripped me. I ran as far away from them as I could. I ran as far from the school as I could.  I ran to the beach, the only safe place I knew, and fell asleep.
When I woke up, it was night, and I suddenly wanted to go swimming. So I took off my converse and socks and jumped in. The water was ultimately warm and felt great.
I saw some dolphins and I was swimming out to them when some thing grabbed my foot and dragged me down, down, down to God knows where...
Sorry its short but I wanted it to end here... Cliffie !!!!!
