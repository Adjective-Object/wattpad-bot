As we approched our spot... Henry winked at me which caused me to blink.... Wait..what??? Henry was cold. If he saw me fall down he'd just laugh... But he IS loyal at times...Ben glared at him.. Nicki just laughed. Chloe yawned and held out a groggy "Good Morning" We kept talking and Sage suggested we should go out and eat Ice cream.. We all agreed.I let go of Ben's hand. I didn't feel staying over at my parents house "Hey, can we maybe go to the park later too?" Ben was the first to say yes.Nicki came over and whispered something to my ear.."You got in a fight again?" Nicki knew everything... She and Sage knew about it.. Ben had no idea, which I was thankful for. Henry just shook my bruises for being clumsy. I sighed and nodded. "Don't you can sleep at mines if you'd like?"I gave a cheeky grin "Of course!!!"
A few minutes passed and the bell rang for classes to start. The Gang split up walking in different ways.
Ben came up to me.."What Class do you have first?"I looked over to my schedule...."English with Mrs Hopkins."I swear I can see Ben's Eyes literally gleaming stars...."I'll walk with you!!!"He held my hand and I smiled at him. He blushed a little but shook it off. "Hey Melissa...""Hm?""Are you d-dating  Henry?""What? No.... Why?""Just asking...."Ben was gentle he wouldn't hurt a fly... Okay maybe he would... BUT , he is a kind being.He can't be jealous...I mean... I can't even take care of my hair!!!My bags made me look Like Panda.
~English~          Mrs Hopkins was an overweight teacher she let us sit wherever we want.  Ben never let go of my hand.. Which I was getting worried about cuz my hand was starting to get sweaty.......Ugh gross....I started to move my fingers around. Which surprisingly worked. I decided to sit next to the window it had the nicest view. The clouds fluffed over the sun was in the very  corner of the window pane. There were trees planted in a nice straight row.I smiled over the sight.. Ben took a seat right next to me.
The Bell Rang and I sat down... I took a good look around the class. Posters of educational spirit stuffwere hung. My classmates seemed decent... Well I guess me and Ben decent..  I saw Jessica .. Ew ... We both get into fights and disagreed alot. She liked wearing trashy clothes.   Mrs Hopkins began the class with a introduction of her self.. As she turned around to write her name she was hit with a pencil... Poor lady.. The whole class laughed except for me and Ben. Mrs Hopkins began to tear up a little. But soon let it off. She yelled at the class and started a loooooong speech about how important it is not to screw up.Mrs. Hopkins kept glancing at me, I thought she knew about my records... Shiz....     After 10 long minutes of lecturing she the class a worksheet. And made us copy it down on a piece of paper.
The class period was quiet after, which was a good thing. I copied the paper occasionally looking to the side... Ben was a slow writer I know he won't make it to the fifth sentence.. So I'll have to lend him my notes later...Being the person I was ,  I finished and the bell rang.. Ben groaned "Umm... Melissa can I borrow your notes?"I nodded. "Sure."
~3rd Period~
Chemistry with Henry.. Is Dangerous I don't know how I even got stuck with him!!!!.....Ugh... And he sat next to me."What are we supposed to doooo???????""What's this red liquid??""Why do we have this mean teacher???" He kept asking me questions.... My head was hurting  and I groaned in pain...He smirked"Save that groan for later..babe."I looked up (since he was tall and all...)And blushed.. Playfully punching his shoulder. The teacher, Mrs Track, assigned us to a worksheet to complete. My head still hurts. "Melissa Archer." Her strong voice filled her class."Yes Mrs Track?" My voice wavered with curiosity. She paused for a while."I remember your sister here..How is she???"My eyes widened...Henry glared at the teacher for bringing her up.. Mrs Track didn't take the hint..The whole class was staring at me ...waiting for me to answer.."...."  My eyes began to water..."Sorry, Melissa..." She gave me sorrowed eyes... Which helped me calm down a little..She turned around and started to teach... Sorry doesn't bring my sister from the dead...
