Scorpio is a lonely, private soul, but they absolutely hate being alone too. This usually morphs into being secretive while still wanting that sense of affection and intimacy they get from people. They don't mind being alone sometimes because they tend to be introverted, and this allows them to get lost in their thoughts and feelings. Solitary time is when they become introspective Â and where they reflect on things, and they often find it relaxing to them. However, if they feel they don't have a very close relationship with someone, they may find themselves feeling lonely and empty feeling, and this feeling becomes greater when alone.
