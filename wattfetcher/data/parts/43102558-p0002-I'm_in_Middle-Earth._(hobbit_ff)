We arrived at Bree. Gandalf led the way to the inn of the Prancing Pony. We entered the inn. I noticed a dwarf about to grab his sword. I quickly sat down beside him. Gandalf and my siblings joined us. The dwarf sighed in relief.
"You must be Thorin Oakenshield. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Michelle. These are Haley, Blake, and Gandalf the Gray." I whispered.
"How do you know my name?" The dwarf questioned me.
"Why else would bounty hunters want to strike at you in front of a crowd? Someone wants you dead." I replied.
"You know a lot though your siblings know nothing." Gandalf stated.
"Where I got my knowledge of Middle-Earth is none of your concern. I know what will happen. I can help with the quest to reclaim Erebor."
"I have an idea. Thorin, this woman can help you. She knows what will happen and when I plan on having a meeting. Trust her. She could be your lifeline. I will take her siblings with me and see you at the end of this month."
Gandalf got up and led Haley and Blake away. I continued to smile though Thorin didn't look happy. I frowned remembered how he was around women and will be to Bilbo. "Come. We might as well go to the room." Thorin said with a hint of anger in his voice. I followed him to our room. I got on one bed while he got on another. I quickly fell asleep.
Michelle's Dream....
I was close to Rivendell. Wargs surrounded us. One aimed for Thorin. It launched at him. I pushed Thorin out of the way and took the hit. The warg scratched at my stomach then bit my side. I screamed in agony. Thorin appeared out of nowhere and killed the warg. I fell to the ground tears falling from me. Thorin picked me up and carried me to a hidden passage. He slid down while keeping his strong grip on me.
"Hold in there Michelle. We will find you aid soon." Thorin whispered.
I knew where the passage was leading. The company went through the passage. Haley and Kili were holding hands. Blake walked behind them. We appeared in view of a beautiful city. I realized that my necklace was missing. I still had my headphones and cell phone. Everyone checked on me. I rested my head on Thorin's shoulder. Gandalf led the way to the city.
"Where are we, Thorin?" I asked.
"We're in Rivendell." Thorin sighed.
"They can help me. I'm losing so much blood."
We entered Rivendell. Gandalf went to speak to an elf. An elven horn sounded in the air. "Let me stand please." I requested wanting to see the elves coming toward us. Thorin placed me down. I stood up still feeling weak. I grabbed Thorin for support then walked over to Gandalf. I looked at my unnatural pale skin. The leader of the elves hopped off his horse. He held my necklace.
"M-my ne-necklace." I stuttered feeling weaker.
"Lord Elrond welcome home." The elf with us smiled.
I fell to the ground feeling faint. Thorin rushed to my side. The helicopter wound reopened. "Urug-i√¢r(orc-blood)!" I cursed in elvish. I put my hand on my helicopter wound. Everything started going black.
End of Dream....
I jolted awake. I lifted my shirt up to my helicopter wound. It was still stitched up. I released my shirt and stood up. I walked to the bathroom. I used the sink to splash water on my face. I dried my face off the went back into the room. Thorin was still asleep. I watched him for a moment with curiosity. It was just a dream. I thought. I walked over to the window. I sat down and stared out the window. I didn't realize that I fell asleep until a pair of strong arms carried me back to bed. The owner pulled my blankets over me. He kissed my forehead.
"Sleep well." The voice whispered.
