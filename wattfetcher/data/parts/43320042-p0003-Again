For the rest of the day my mind is very focused on all of the paperwork. It can be a little stressful with all of the work that has been loaded onto my shoulders from just today. But it all goes by fast because before I know it, it's time for me to go home.
I ride in my car without any thoughts in mind just listening to the relaxing lyrics of my favorite artists such as One Direction, Ariana Grande, Ed Sheeran, and Sam Smith. I can't wait to just be at home and relax. I also can't wait to see my puppy Rux. I got Rux a year ago. He is a German Shepherd.
Once I get home I get in the shower. When I get out I decide to order pizza, only because I didn't want to cook a huge meal. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza and curled up on the couch with some hot cocoa, pizza, Rux, and Netflix. I pretty much fell asleep there too.
