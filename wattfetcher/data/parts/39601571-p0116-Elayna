So as I said earlier, I was thinking about making a quote book. Where I'll just write random quotes about stuff. Yeah, so since I decided not to do the edit on vine, why not do it here? So what you guys will be doing is making a cover! It's going to be for my quote book!
What The cover must have:My user ( SilverWolf_Luna )___________________________
Prizes: Something online. Like if you like Taylor Swift I'll get you something from her merchandise. Something like that. _____________________________________
You can enter as many as you want! ( the more you enter, the better chance you have of winning ðŸ˜‰ )
When you guys are done and want me to see them this is what you'll do.< if you have a book just put the cover in the media and then have the title be #CoverContest and tag me in it
< if you don't have a book...just make one. You can delete it later.
I'll comment on it so you guys know I saw it to.
____________________
I'm not going by if I know the person or not! When I pick to see what cover I want I won't even be looking at who made it! So I'm not just going to pick one by someone I "like".
If you guys have a book then please tell your readers about this so more people can enter :( I don't want just 2 or 3 people participating. I'm not doing this for more views or anything I just want more people to enter something.
It ends June 20th!!!!
Remember you can enter as many covers as you want! And it's for my 'Quotes' book, so keep that in mind!
Good luck to everyone! ðŸ˜˜
Any other questions just comment down below and I'll get to you as soon as possible :)
