Sophie's POV"Ugh her room has to many boxs," My annoying step sister said. I live with my mom, my step dad Frank, step sister Autumn. "Wake up. You need to get ready and then I HAVE to show you around," Autumn said. "Ugh okay," I said waking up. I got ready I got dressed in black long pants and my One Direction tank top. I got my bag and lunch ready. "I'm ready to go," I say to Autumn as she is doing her make up. "Let me finish my makeup then we will leave," she said giving me the death glare. "Have fun on your first day of school honey," Mom said as she kissed my cheek. "Have fun at work," I said as I hugged her. "Ready to go," Autumn said walking down the stairs. "Yep. First day of school here I come," I said Autumn rolled her eyes. Ten minutes later we are here at Hismeric High.
