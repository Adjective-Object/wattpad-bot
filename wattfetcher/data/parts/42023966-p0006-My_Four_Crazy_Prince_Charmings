It's now June 16 20** night time. You know what? I better sleep, it's been rough and all, we've patch things up... Some things. Better turn in for the night. We have drama tomorrow! YAS! This Friday we have winter sports day. Next week Friday is last day of Term/Semester. Yep two weeks after next week we're in term 3! Woop! Another step closer to Year 11!! *yawn* yep really need to go now.

Sorry if it was short. I'm really sorry!! Please forgive me for what I said in Diane's POV was all true in real life. Except for the part when I said Declan and I have been best friends since I had my first birthday that's not true, I only met him last year. And also Ace in real life we are pretty distant. Just putting it out there. Reminder: I only took some of the names in real life, my friends own these names. But everything else is basically out of my brain... Haha goodnight amigos! It's currently 10:58 here in Australia, better sleep! Or else my drama teacher would notice it would be embarrassing since he's my favourite teacher and all. Haha goodnight! Xoxo~DareDreamer_XD
