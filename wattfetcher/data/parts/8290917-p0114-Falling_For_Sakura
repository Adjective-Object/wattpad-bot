"I have to fix my dress," Sakura said without thinking, her mind still on Darcy.
"I'll help," Conrad announced.
She chuckled. "How?"
"Dunno. But I'll help."
"I'm meeting up with Beth, Katherine, and Mary later. They're here to see how I got on with the dress. I'll have to tell them about what happened."
"Are you?"
Sakura laughed uncomfortably. "To the dress. Don't worry. I'm not about to spread rumors about your sisters attacking me. See ya later," she said, heading out the door.
Conrad had a sad look on his face as he watched her go.
