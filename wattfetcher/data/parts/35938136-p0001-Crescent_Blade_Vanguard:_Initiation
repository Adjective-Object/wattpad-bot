Greetings, dear readers! I am Sokhakmonny Bun, the writer of "Crescent Blade". Welcome to the second book of the "Crescent Blade" series, "Crescent Blade Vanguard: Initiation"!
Thanks to my sister, Sophie who drew this cover and tried her best to make it as close to my imagination as possible. Though I wanted it to be anime-ish, I doubt I could find anyone generous enough to draw me an anime cover so thank you sister for the making of this cover. You're the best!
After a while, despite my putting down Apocalypse which is also a huge chunk of my imaginations, I have been working hard on writing Crescent Blade and I have learned plenty about story writing so I hope this one is a bit better than the last book. I reckon it being thronged with errors, both typographical and grammatical. I deeply apologise for that if I am not making any sense at some part of the story.
For this second book, I will try to spare my time through my tight schedule to write and make each chapter slightly shorter than before to ease the reader's eyes while striving to convey everything through each chapter.
Without further ado, I hope you enjoy reading "Crescent Blade". Please, leave a vote if you like my work or you could drop in a comment if you have any suggestions. It really helps!
Thanks in advance!
