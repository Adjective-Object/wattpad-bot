Marco led the trio through the hallway and into Whitebeard's office. On the way, it couldn't be helped to notice that the three were popular in the school especially Haruka and Aya.

"Haruka-senpai!"
"I love you!"
"Haruka-senpai!"

"Yeah, I know you girls missed me." Haruka sighed, passing his hand through his hair. All of the girls fainted and those who didn't turned a new shade of red.

"Aya-chwan!"
"Aya-chan, I missed you at the infirmary!"

"Ploof, I'm sorry I was gone for such a long time!" Aya apologized.
"Aya-chan, your useless sounds are adorable!"

"You are too innocent." Sakura noted.
"I don't really mind them that much." Aya answered smiling. Sakura smiled at her response until some familiar rough voices removed her from her gaze.

"I see that you've made it back safely, my sweet cupcake." Caroline cooed. Sakura waved back.

"Isn't that an okama?" Haruka asked, peering into Sakura's face. The girls all bit their shirts in righteous fury while mumbling profantites under their breath.
"Yeah, so what?"
"They're okamas. You know, people with homosexual habits."
"Like Haruka?"
"I.AM.NOT.GAY."
"Sorry, Mr. Ace-obessed."

A few minutes later, the trio found themselves infront of Whitebeard's office. An audible gulp was heard from the three of them as Marco gestured for them to enter the office.

"Oyaji, here are the three rogues."

Sakura's eyes, couldn't stay on the ground for long and soon met with the piercing eyes of the the massively tall man that was in front of her. Fear quickly overtook the student's body and soon, she started trembling vigorously.
Aya took a side glance at her friend and noted her trembling and the cold sweat that dotted her face. Maybe, Whitebeard was using Conqueror's Haki at the moment. She wouldn't know because she's been used to the occasional outbursts from clashing parties.

"So, you are three pupils who disobeyed a direct order." Both Haruka and Aya hung their heads in shame. Sakura, on the other hand, collapsed to her knees and started breathing heavily.

"As I thought," Aya concluded, "He was using Conqueror's Haki and Sakura was already falling weak to it."
