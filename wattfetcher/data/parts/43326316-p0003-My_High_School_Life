My phone started to ring but I ignored it. I roamed through my closet for something hot and sexy to wear to Derek's party tonight. I found my blue laced dress that was almost about to show my ass. I went in my shoeÂ closet to find a pair of heels to wear and I spotted my black heels that I wear to clubs. Jason called me again and I answered it.
"hello I said.
hey why didn't you answer last time he said.
I was driving I said.
oh, well you want me to come pick you up or you driving yourself he asked?
ill drive myself, I want to surprise you with what im wearing I said.
damn girl, you hype alright ill see you there he said."
I grabbed the keys and my phone and headed out the door. As I was leaving my mom was pulling in the driveway with Jordan in the passenger seat. He looked really mad and then asked me to go to the party with me. I told him he could and we headed to the party. she must have told him that she was principle.
We arrived here and everyone was in the back with all the beer. Jason was standing around talking to the boys. I walked up to where they were standing and grabbed Jason's hand and took him up to the guest room.
" Are we about to... he asked?
yup I said. "
