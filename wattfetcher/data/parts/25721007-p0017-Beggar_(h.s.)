A mix of emotions are swirling in my mind. I can't decide if I'm shocked or glad or angry. There is no way that this is real right now. She's dead.. or was dead.
The expression on my sister's face was pure fear. She wasn't scared of me, she was scared of my reaction. I mean, I would feel the same way if I was in her shoes.
"Fawn," I repeated, "How is this even possible? You're supposed to be dead."
The man she is with has a look of confusion in his eyes. Fawn stayed silent for a moment, like she was thinking.
"It's.. It's a long story," she turned away not daring to face me. I sighed.
"I have time," I spoke and sat down in the empty chair at their table.
"Fine.." she sighed in defeat, "Before the ambulance came, I woke up. Everyone else in the vehicle was knocked out or dead. So, I ran. I ran far away from the hospital. The only place I could think of to go to was Kayden's house. His parents gladly welcomed me to live there. Fortunately, I had no major damage done to my body. I stayed with Kayden until I graduated high school last year."
"And you never thought to check the hospital to see if any of us survived?! You just left! How the fuck could you?" I started to yell and a few heads turned my way. Tears welded up in my eyes.
"I.. No," Fawn frowned and Kayden looked the opposite way. I cannot believe my own sister betrayed me. I could've went to collage. I could've had a life, a relationship. Instead, I worked for Brock and slept on the streets for three years.
"I was homeless for three years, Fawn! Three damn years! This guy made me sell drugs and work as a prostitute! You know how many times I wanted to die? Too many. Too fucking many. If you would've came back, I would've had a life," I cracked and the tears spilled from my orbs.
"I'm so sorry.. I didn't know," she almost did the same.
"Well no shit you didn't know! You were too busy living the high life while I was living on the streets!" I shouted. This time, everyone was watching us. Before I could do anything I would regret, I stormed out of the shop leaving my asshole of a sister behind.

Soon as I reached the apartment, I was greeted with four, British boys. The first thing I noticed is that Harry wasn't there. Please don't tell me that Brock took him..
"Where's Harry?"
"Oh, he went out with someone," Louis shrugged. I swear, my heart just dropped to my feet. Who's someone?
"Who?" I asked shakily. I'm afraid of the reply. What if Brock did take him? What if this is the last I'll see Harry? What if..
"His stepfather," Liam answered and relief filled me.
I am so sorry guys. This is the shortest chapter ever! It's probably not even a page long. I really wanted to update though. I'll make it up to you guys by making the next chapter long. I'll try to update in a few days too instead of a week.
Vote. <3
