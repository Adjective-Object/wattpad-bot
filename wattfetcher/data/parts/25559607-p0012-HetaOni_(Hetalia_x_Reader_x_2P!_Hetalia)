Before he got near the other man, I grabbed Japan by the sleeve and asked for the key. He gave it to me and I quickly hurried to lock the door. Phew. I watched the two from afar.
Japan was about to tap Prussia's shoulder or something, but Prussia swiftly turned around with a sword in hand.
"Hh!Who's there!?"
"Woah!C-Calm down! It's me!"
"Oh, it's you Japan?Ah... Sorry"
"Are you alright?"
"Th-There was a monster! I saw it!!Ah, a stark naked giant with the color of a rotten scone!!"
I stifled a giggle at his description.
"It's true! We all saw it!Me, and West, and Italy too!"
"Yes, I know."
"Before I knew it, I'd wound up here.Those two... I don't know where they went.Am I making any sense?"
"Yes, quite. That does make sense.I saw it, too."
"What the hell is that THING?O... Oh!! And what happened to the others?! And...and... Who's that frau over there?" Prussia then pointed at me.
I waved nervously.
"Ah.. This is _____-chan." Japan motioned me to move closer to them and I did so.
"Nice to meet you, frau. I am the AWESOME PRUSSIA. Kesesese!" He said gallantly as he shook my hand.
"N-Nice to meet you, too.." I said. I was still torn between fangirling because I'm meeting Hetalia characters...and being terrified because this is HetaOni...
"So... you got stuck here in this house, too, huh?" He said symphatetically.
"Yeah..." I replied.
"Did...you see that monster...?" He asked slowly.
I haven't seen Steve yet...but I know that he's here...so I should just tell them I did.
"Yeah...I did..." I said quietly.
"Mhm.. Don't worry! The awesome me is here to protect you! We'll get out of here in no time." He told me as he ruffled my (h/c) hair a bit.
"Thanks..." I said.
"Anyways, Japan... about the others?" Prussia said, turning to his friend.
"Germany is on this same floor.He claimed he was hungry.But... I haven't found Italy.Do you have any idea where he might be?" Japan asked.
"What!? Italy's missing!?Do you think he was attacked by that monster?"
"We can't be 100% sure..But he's very fast and good at running away.I do believe he managed to escape somehow."
"All right!! Then I'll look for him too!But first, let's go where West is. What's he doing anyway?""He said he was too hungry to move. Prussia, don't you have anything for him to eat?"
"Something to eat...Now that you mention it, I did find some mushrooms while I was running away.Will that do?"
"That should do."
I suddenly spoke up. "U-Uhm, I've got lots of food in my bag, too." I told them.
Prussia gave me a thumbs up. "Good job, frau! All right! Then let's..."
He became silent for a while.
I remembered what was going to happen, so I hurriedly went behind Prussia and clutched his sleeve.
