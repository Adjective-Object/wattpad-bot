Just then, Kalin, Myles, Lauren, and Arden popped out of the garage door. The four immediately saw what was happening: Jenn was bleeding, Marcia was injured, and Andrea was scared shitless. They gave each other quick glances and nods before screaming and tackling Marcia.
Jenn ignored everything, just glad it was probably over. She looked over at Andrea, who was already staring at her. They both ignored the blood pouring out of Jenn's arm, and just looked at each other with large frowns and near tears. Andrea pulled Jenn in for the hug of a bear as the two released their tears simultaneously. They disregarded the obnoxious sounds of their friends beating a girl up and focused on what really mattered.
"None of it's true, Jenn," Andrea assured her, "you make me so happy. I want you here and with me, not anywhere else but by my side. We all want you. Maybe it's too early, but I already know I want you forever -- Nobody else. You're all mine, I'm all yours, and not even a crazed druggie could change that for us." Jenn nodded, feeling extremely weak.
"I'm just really glad to have you. I'd be dead without you, Andrea."
