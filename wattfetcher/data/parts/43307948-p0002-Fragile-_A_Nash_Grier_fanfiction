~Nash POV~
Yes. Today she gets to meet my friends. I invited Cameron, Aaron, both Jacks, Taylor& Carter. My stupid brother Hayes has to hangout with me and my friends. Little twerp that kid is. As much as I love him, I always want to just kick his arse.
~knock knock~ She's here. Okay stay calm. I slowly open the door to see her looking beautiful as ever. She wore a white nirvana crop top and wash-out high wasted jean shorts. "Hey Nash. Are those your friends over there staring at me?" she asked quietly with a shy smile revealing her white teeth.
"Yeah that's them alright" I laugh.
Jordan POV~
OMG. Jack and Jack? Taylor Caniff? Cameron Dallas?! Oh lord. I'm gonna pass out. "Aye guys, this is Jordan. Jordan these are my boys" Nash said in an odd voice. Now I know how I recognized Nash! He's a vine and YouTube sensation! Oh my god. They all are. I'm in the same house with my bae Cameron Dallas. Cameron ran up to me and sang a very catchy song. "Do you got a bae or nah? Is you trynna date or nah?" "Nah" I said while letting out a slight laugh. "Hear that boyyysss. She's single" he said loudly with a smirk and a wink. Damn I love Cameron Dallas.
"Damn I love Cameron Dallas too" Jack G laughed. "Did I say that out loud? Oh god that's embarassing." "You know you think out loud a lot" Nash chuckled.
Is Cameron blushing??
Cameron POV~
I must admit. She's stunning. Like wow. But I think Nash likes her. Just thinking that gives me a sour taste in my mouth and a bad feeling in my stomach. Like jealousy. I can't be jealous no. No. I barely know her. I shouldn't be developing feelings this quickly.
Jordan POV~
I went home about 10 minutes ago. But Taylor became my best friend. We cuddled and watched movies until I had to go home. I think i might like Taylor Caniff. Oh god..
