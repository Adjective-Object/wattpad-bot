"Assalamu alaykom wa rahmato allah wa barakatoh , Assalamu alaykom wa rahmato allah wa barakatoh" I finished my prayer and du'aa' Then turned around to see who was there .
"What were you doing" Damon asked, that guy keeps popping up in front of me
"pray-ing" My voice broke at the end of the word, I tried to hold myself
mind: You're strong hold yourself
"What's wrong" He stepped closer to me
"Don't get any closer, I'm Okay" I went to my locker to get something to wipe my eyes with
"Your eyes are puffy, were you crying?" He asked, I could feel worry in his tone, but I wont buy it because he's just a player and a liar.
"No, I've been cleaning them with soap and lemon"
"You can't hold your sarcastic side, can't you?" He chuckled, I ignored his comment and walked in my own direction, He kept calling my name but I ignored
A class after another until they finished and it was time to go home.
I unlocked my phone to see a message from Elina
I'm out with my boyfriend, don't wait for me.
Really ? no like really ???? as if I know how to go back home???
I'm not gonna stay in the school, and definitely not going home with Damon. I guess I should've put some small rocks like Hansel and Gretel
mind: wohohhoww look who's in trouble
me: you know, it's the perfect time for you to work and tell me which road to take
mind: sorry I'm taking a rest
me: One day I'll replace you.
mind: technically, it's not possible
me: just shut up please.
I looked at Damon who was laughing with his friends and was about to ask him to guide me to the house or to walk with me.
naaaah, I prefer walking back alone, What's the worst thing that can happen ???

I walked and walked for hours, I called Elina and Mrs.Carter but they didn't answer.
"Need a ride"
I ignored the guy and didn't look towards him but he kept talking.
"Why are you walking alone" Another guy appeared in my face, I changed my way but I felt a tight grip around my wrist.
"listen to me boy, You'll be sorry if you don't let me go" I warned him
"Just look in my eyes please, I sooo wanna stare at these big eyes, I'll be sorry IF I let you go" He tightened his grip
"You asked for it AH" I punched his tummy with my free hand and kicked his chest, (Hamdulella I wore pants under the skirt today),
"S-Sorry Ma'm" He ran away.
"Good punch" The guy in the car said
"You too should leave before you get some"
He left at the speed of light .
