Hi!!I've noticed that a few therians have shared their own experiences as a therian in journals over wattpad and so I thought I'd share my own experiences as an Alpha.
So to start off I suppose I should introduce myself.Just quickly though, I will not use my human name, only my therian name throughout the whole journal.
•my age is none of your concerns.•as a human, I am female.•I'm a fox therian•I have given my therio-type the name Jax• Jax is male. •We are the Alpha of peacekeepers pack
So that's it for now I suppose I'll be going over more later.
