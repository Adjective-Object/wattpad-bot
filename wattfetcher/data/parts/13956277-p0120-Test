I pulled away and looked at Simon who looked like he was daydreaming, his expressions were priceless, "You just did not .." He was shocked, "Yes I did" I chuckled, "Oh my God!" He said then grabbed my neck and kissed me again, and I didn't mind at all, Oh sins, how sweet they are ... Butterflies were bumping into each others in my belly, I felt like I was flying between the clouds.
Simon pulled away and gasped, "You better leave before I become unable to control myself and do something we'll both regret. Go" He said and turned his face away from me but I could see his smile through his skull, I walked slowly toward him and hugged him from the back, "I love you" He said and turned around, he lowered his head until our foreheads and noses touched "And I won't let anything happen to you, I'll protect you till the last drop of blood I have" I couldn't hide my happiness, I finally let my feelings free, "I know" I said then climbed to my window, "YES" I heard Simon shout, I looked down and I saw him dancing stupidly, I cleared my throat and he stood still in his place while his red cheeks popped out, I chuckled.
"My first kiss" I whispered to myself as I was rewinding what happened, in my mind. WAIT ! WHAT ! WHAT HAVE I DONE! I screwed everything up, Astaghferollah ... I started crying.
Satan/Shaitan: Why are you crying? There's nothing to regret, it was the best feeling you've ever felt..
Me: But It's haraam, what I've done was clearly refused in Islam, it's haraam
Satan: No, it's not, you just followed your heart, and love is not haraam, plus, you've always been so strict about following your religion, you've forbidden yourself from trying awesome things.
Me: But, I've done it to please Allah and that's all what I care about, pleasing Allah and getting into paradise.
Satan: But hey ! Doesn't Allah forgive people ? You believe that he forgives whoever makes a mistake, right? And you've not done anything wrong, you fell in love and emotions cannot be controlled. Me: I guess you are not totally wrong ..
Satan: Girl, I'm totally right, plus, look at Simon ! I ME AN LOOK AT HIM, he is a sexy beast, what stupid girl would refuse having such a sweet,caring,handsome amd rich buddy to take care of her, this man is whipped and you made him crazy.
Conscience: Leena, don't listen to the Satan, he's just simplifying the sins for you and making them sweet and beautiful for you to fall in.
Satan: How come? Leena, I'm just giving you a motivation to live your full life, to have fun, to not miss a thing in it. And at the end ... If he gets really attached, he'lol become Muslim to marry you ! And tht's a good thing ! You'll get into Jannah for making him Muslim ! But first, you need to do some steps to win him.
Me: What steps?
Satan: You need to tempt him, make him crave you, be sweet, hang out together, show him more of your pure beauty.
Conscience: Leena please don't ! Just think about it, think about all what you have been doing to protect yourself from falling into the whole of sins..
But, at the end ... Satan won and controlled me.

"Wake up" I jumped on Simon's bed, "WHAT? WHO? WHERE?" He jumped like a freaked monkey, I laughed out loud, "What are you doing here?" Simon said with his attractive morning voice, "Waking you up, now get up"I tried to pull the blanket but he caught it and pulled it, "NO, I'm naked !" He said and I laughed, "So what?" I raised an eyebrow, "Oh girl ! You're freaking me out", "Kidding, get dressed and follow me, we have a scedual" I chuckled, "Where's Karam?" He asked, "He's out" I said, a devilish smile was drawn on Simon's face, "Then, I can steal a kiss" He said then leaned toward me, "No way ! Morning breath you stinky beast" I pushed him back and walked out as his laugh was loud enough to wake the whole neighborhood.
