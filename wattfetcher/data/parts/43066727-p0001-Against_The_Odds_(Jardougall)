I grew up in a small town, filled to the brim with nameless nobodies and a lack of excitement. Then again, Ohio wasn't exactly a state that was famous for thrills and drama. But it was a safe place, everyone was friendly and it was an agreeable environment to raise a child in, and for that reason I was pleased to call it my hometown. I had a lot of memories from that neighborhood, particularly the movie theatre which was only a short bus ride away. Me and my best friend would regularly spend our weekends on the edge of a dirty cinema seat, caught up in the latest blockbuster film. It was an amazing way to grow up as at that point in time our little village had little influence from modern media and it was like a secret club for us.
Jenna was my best friend and was always so full of life, bringing light and smiles to every room she entered, she was better at me at everything by miles and there was no doubt that I was dramatically overshadowed by her and her talents. I was pretty plain, or at least in comparison, however that didn't cease our seemingly unbreakable bond.I recall at one point in the middle of a teen drama, she leaned over the arm rest, nearly spilling my coke to whisper in my ear "I want to be up there one day"."What?, Like in a movie?" My twelve year old self replied."Yeah..." Jenna replied, turning her attention back to the film. I didn't speak. I didn't know what to say and it didn't feel like anything had to be said. It was totally possible for Jenna to achieve a film star status, she was perfect for the role.And in the end she became what she aspired to be. She was a diva, a star and an icon. And I was stuck miles and miles away, living the polar opposite life.
