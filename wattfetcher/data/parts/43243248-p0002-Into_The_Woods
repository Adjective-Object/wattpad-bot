"I promose."
*End of Flashback*
If you can't already tell, she broke that promise, and went into the woods. Ever since, I couldn't focus on anything but her.
A knock on the door made me jump back to reality. I'm in my room, not next to her. When I finally realized there was someone at the door I replied with a simple, "What?"
My mom poked her head through the door. "Come on Jasmine! Its time to actually do something! You moped in your room to 2 months now! Sitting in here won't bring her back you know." That's when I snapped. I cried. I don't like cring on front of people cause shows weakness, yet I didnt know what else to do.
I was instantly in my moms arms with her humming a soothing tune. "We will find her Jasmine. The police is doing all they can! Trust them." With that she left. How can I "trust" the police, when there not doing anything?!
With that, I fell asleep dreaming of Lea.
