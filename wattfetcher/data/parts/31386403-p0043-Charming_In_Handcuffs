This again? "I don't know. I'll see what Meredith and James—"
"Forgot about them." Jack quickly stood up on his feet. "Tell James I said hi." He started walking back to his house and I stopped him.
"Wait!" I called out and he froze. "I'll come over tomorrow. We can study then instead of in the middle of the night. I'll just say I'm with Lindy."
He just waved back as he walked inside his house.
Talk about a pain in the ass.

Yay an update!! I'm trying to update at least once a week because of school, sorry if chapters are late. :/
I hope you liked this chapter! The comments on the last chapter made my day, so thanks so much for that! And can't forget about all the votes, thanks sooooo much!
P.S. I'm gonna start adding music again in the next chapter!

See you in the next chapter! :)
