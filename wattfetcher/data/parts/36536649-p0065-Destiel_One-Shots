"Dean," Castiel began, "if you could travel through time, where would you go?"
Currently, Dean and Castiel were laying next to each other, staring at the sky from the viewpoint of Mary's garden.
"Don't you mean, when would I go?" Dean asked, smug.
"Dean. Really, babe?"
"Yes," he said. Castiel punched his arm. "Okay, okay. Uhm, I dunno. I guess I'd do something like freak everyone from the 1890's out by showing them my iPhone?"
"Dean."
"What? Okay. Well, maybe I wouldn't do that. I'd probably kill Bill Gates and take his place."
Cas laughed. "Same here."
"Well, okay, if we're being serious... I'd probably go back to the day I met you," Dean said seriously.
"What, when we were seven?" Cas asked.
"Yeah," Dean laughed. "It was Gabe's birthday, remember?"
"I remember my mom inviting every kid in the neighborhood," Cas grumbled.
Dean crossed his arms like a child having a tantrum, and said, in the same tone of voice, "My mom made me go."
"Shut up, Dean. You know how people make me feel."
"Yeah, yeah. Well, it wasn't that bad. I met you, didn't I, Cas?"
"You poured Hawaiian Punch all over me!"
"That was not my fault! It was all Sammy, I'm telling ya."
"Yeah, okay, a three-year-old will pour punch over a seven-year-old. Sounds legit," Cas said rolling his eyes.
Dean grabbed Castiel's hand and kissed it. "Will you ever forgive me?"
"Possibly, peasant. If you fetch me some cake," Cas deadpanned.
Dean dropped Cas' hand. "Nope."
"Sigh. I guess you'll stay unforgiven, then. Such a shame..."
"Whatever. We're getting off-track. Castiel, if you could travel through time, when-" he winked "-would you go?"
Castiel thought for a moment.
"Here," he said finally.
"What?" Dean asked, confused.
"I'd go here. Well, stay here, rather." He took Dean's hand in his own and kissed Dean's cheek. "I've got everyone and everything I could ever want or need right here next to me."
