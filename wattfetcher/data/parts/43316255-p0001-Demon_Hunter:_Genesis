I don't remember what happened nine years ago. I was only a child at the time, only five years. Mace told me the event was traumatizing, and in an effort to protect myself my mind decided to suppress my memories.
I do know a few things. Just a few bits and pieces. I know my parents are gone, they were killed in the event that occurred almost a decade ago. I know there was a fire, a lot of fire. I also remember a voice and a face. Every time I closed my eyes I could see it.
It was a boy, around the same age as me, only he seemed a few inches taller. He was surrounded by flames and his lips were in the shape of a twisted smile. His hair was pure white, appearing orange because of the fire. His eyes were unnaturally golden, and seemed to glow brighter than the fires that surrounded him.
"...Don't forget me." The boy said, revealing perfectly white, but wickedly sharp teeth. After that everything went dark, and I couldn't remember anything else. I felt I knew the boy somehow, his name seemed to be on the tip of my tongue but I could never remember it. For the past nine years I had tried to remember but to no avail.
The next thing I remember after that event is laying in a bed, covered in bandages. I had been seriously wounded, but I didn't remember how. When I opened my eyes the first thing I saw was Mace. At first I was confused and tried to look for my parents. When I couldn't find them I began crying and I asked Mace where they were. He didn't keep any secrets, he told me exactly what happened to them.
"They died."ï»¿
