"Wh-what do you mean cutting me off?"
"We won't be paying for your college anymore if you keep this up. You better fix it or you're coming home from that tour."
"I'll fix it don't worry I can't leave this tour I need the money. Look I'll talk to my professor and see if there is a way to make it up or something."
"You better or you'll be a goner." She snapped before hanging the phone up.
I sighed and threw my phone down, "Fucking damn it!" I grabbed my computer quick. I had to talk to my professor about this. I couldn't fail. I quickly sent him an email asking if there was any possible way I could bring my grade up, I can't leave this tour. I just can't.
"Hey Kells what's going on?" Mike asked and I shook my head.
"I might have to leave the tour." I said sadly and looked up my grades.
"What? Why?"
"My grades."
"Why would that make you have to leave tour?"
"Because I have an F. I have a stupid, ugly fucking F!" I said looking at my grades. "I'm such an idiot!"
"Hey calm down. It's gonna be fine. You're a genius you'll get it back up to an A or whatever." He said calmly.
"What if I don't? What if I end up failing the class and turn into a complete and total failure?" I said trying not to cry.
"I don't know! Just uh- just calm down." He said, "Vic your boyfriend is having a meltdown and I don't know what to do!"
Mike was soon replaced by Vic who sat down by me and held me, "Baby what's wrong?"
I showed him my grades, "I'm an idiot. That's what's wrong! I'm a stupid fucking idiot and I'm never going to go anywhere in life."
"Hey, hey, you'll get it back up. You just need to email your professor and he'll tell you what's wrong or whatever."
"I did and he's not responding and my parents are threatening to stop paying for college and they keep telling me to just leave the tour and I don't want to but what if they're right?"
"Leave tour? Don't leave tour."
"I don't want to, I wanna stay here with you and Alan and everyone else but what if I end up having to?"
"I guess you gotta do what you gotta do baby. But hey just wait for your professor to get back to you and see whats up. Maybe everything is just fine and he forgot to put some paper in or something."
"I hope that's all that is." I said and he pulled me to him wrapping his arms around me, "But what if I have to?"
"Then I'll miss you. I would do whatever I can to be able to talk to you in some way. It'll be hard but worth it for us both in the end."
"Really?" I asked him, "You- you would do that?"
"Of course I would. I really like you Kells and I don't want to lose you." He said and kissed the side of my head.
"I really like you too." I told him and shut my computer.
He smiled and brushed some hair from my face, "Everything is gonna be just fine."
I smiled and leaned my head on his shoulder, "I hope so I really don't want to lose you."
"I don't want to lose you either."
"What time is it?" I asked him yawning.
