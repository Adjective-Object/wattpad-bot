after i got out of the shower i was different from when i was previously reading my book.i felt like my body was slowly being shut down..
i couldnt talk..my eyes felt heavy as i began feeling week from the pain..i didnt have energy..i dont even have energy to type..it was just..gone..my head was tilted at a weird angle but as usual i couldnt do anything about it..
'i have to suck it up...i still have homework to do..'i thought to myself.i would have groaned,but i couldnt..i didnt even have the streangth to talk or yell at my dog for opening my door.
i don't know whats going on..'I'm just tired..yah..thats it..'i didn't have to be smart to know that. slowly i found out that my head had tilted in the strange dagree as i first found it in.
i rolled my eyes but even then it hurt..i cracked my knuckles as i continued to type.pulling my hair from my shirt i found at least some energy to speed up my typing..
i feel on my back backwards bringing the computer with me but wincing after cursing out of more pain.i glared still feeling like it was impossable to open my mouth and talk.it felt like my lips where glued together.
lifting my back up slowly half way i took out my phone,earphones,and coloring pencil box from under me and set them on the tabel next to my bed letting out a few muffled coufs.swollowing some spit in my mouth i layed down my aching neck.
it was hard for me to type since i could only see the screen and the keyboard?..not so much.. ahh well maybe it was the weather thats making me feel this way..it is pretty crappy out side...i just wish i had my girlfriend with me holding me so she could try to make all the pain go away..but i know that couldnt happen..our love was basically forbidden.
i lifted my head-painfully-up so i could find where that damn B letter was.i glared and mentally cursed.
