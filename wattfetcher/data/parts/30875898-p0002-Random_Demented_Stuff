We need so many things to survive:
Food, water, warmth, medicine, blood, a heart, fat, muscle, oxygen, and a hell a lot more                           I don't understand why we need these things. Well I know why, but I don't, if you understand that. Okay, let me explain, like I know we need food to make energy to live, and I know we need oxygen to go through our bodies to keep everything working properly, but why? Why food, why not... I don't know paint, why can't someone survive off of paint or something? Why oxygen, why not Carbon Dyeoxide, or even Carbon Monoxide? I mean there are so many unanswered questions. How dowe live? Why do we live? How do we get here? Is anyone really here, or is this just a long dream? Damn, life is complicated. Why is life so complicated?
