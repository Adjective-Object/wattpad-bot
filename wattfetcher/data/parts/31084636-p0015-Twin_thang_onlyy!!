I started twerkin on him surprisingly he kept up with my speed. He was holding my hips as if he was guiding me. Wtf is u doing I heard someone say. I saw Jeremiah with a wine glass in his hand. Who tf u talking to i ask him. I'm talking to u, yo ass ova here grinding and twerkin on his bitch ass Miah says mad asl. Who tf u calling a bitch Ricki says cuz we can T'up. After that Miah punches him in the face and knocks him out cold. Damnnnnnnnn I heard people saying. Talm bout T'up bitch ass ant even know competition Miah says drinking some more of his drink.

See this nigga making me mad and making my Caribbean accent come out. I went and sat back at a stool at the table with my friends. I knew Jeremiah was standing behind me but I didn't give a fuck. Shawty u wana dance Miah asks Layla staggering a little. Layla looks at me I guess asking for my approval I just shrugged. They started to walk away and went to go dance. I just finished drinking and talking. Why didn't u go dance with Miah fine ass Keisha asks me. Cuz I don't like his ass he just drives me to a point where I wana fucking kill him and strangle his ass I say. Aw well if that was me he wudnt be able to control this big ass country booty she says I laughed.
I was chugging I had to drink all this beer while Romelle poured it down my throat while I layed on the table. Goooooooo twin people were saying. Some people were saying CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG they cheered me on. I kept gulping that shit down. I knew if twin came down here and saw me doin this she wud literally try and beat my ass, buhh shiii oh well YOLO. I finished and they was screaming Yay TWINNN TWINN TWINNN. I got up and D patted my shoulders and laughed. I hopped off of the table while staggering. Then D asked for a dance. I was jiggling my ass left and right. Once i was done I told my friends to come on the dance floor and we was dancing on each other. Sooo I see this is the turn down for wat clique Miah says I wana join he says smiling. I laughed and grabbed him. Try me by Dej Loaf came on and I start grinding on him. He was holding my hips and I felt him pull me close. Our chest were touching one another. Then I started rolling on him and twerkin my shit was jumping and jiggling everywhere. He pulled me close to where I was twerking in between his legs. Then the song switched over to Beyonc√© song I think its called in the air or some shit like that, ion kno shit I'm drunk. I started making my hips go up and down like how Shakira does. He started holding them trying to guide them. After the song went off me and Miah kissed and then we start tongue kissing. A moan then escaped my mouth he laughed I did too. # I'm drunk asf. We then saw Jassiah and Chynah come in and they looked then spotted us. I see y'all having a good time Nay says eyeing me. Jassiah was shaking his head then says yea a little bit too much fun.
