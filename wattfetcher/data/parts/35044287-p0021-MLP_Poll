I have to admit, I'm not surprise this one got out first. I had a feeling that it would either be this or Winter Wrap Up. But I'm still sad to see it go, because this was the first song in MLP that I listened to. But as always if you  voted it out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started.
And the nominees are:
WINTER WRAP UP
TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME
LET THE RAINBOW REMIND YOU
HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN
THIS IS OUR BIG NIGHT
BATS
CRYSTAL BALLAD
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
WELCOME TO THE SHOW
SHAKE YOUR TAIL
SHINE LIKE RAINBOWS
PERFECT DAY FOR FUN
Good luck to the nominees!
