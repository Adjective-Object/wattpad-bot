I woke up just a few minutes before my alarm clock. I could've just laid there but I decided to get ready instead. Today was the first day back to school. But today is special. This is my last year of high school.
In a way I'm excited but then I remember I still have to do work this year so I guess I'm not as excited.
I went to my closet and pick out a white lace dress that ended just above my knees, with a little black belt. I also picked out a pair of black ballet flats. I don't wear this all the time but what can it hurt?
"Sara are you coming!" my mom yelled from down stairs. " I'm almost done" I replied. I finished getting ready, grabbed my stuff and went down the stairs.
When I walked into the kitchen my mom nearly dropped the dishes that she was washing. "Oh, look at you all dressed up!" she said with the biggest smile that I've ever seen.
"It's nothing much, I just figured 'why not'" I said picking up a pop tart and shoving it in my mouth.
"Bye mom."
"Bye sweetheart have a good last, first day!" And then I was out the door. I got in the car and and started the engine.
Soon I was driving down the road and I was thinking about what my mom said. And then it hit me. No I mean it really hit me! I just hit someone's car. I am so dead.
I rushed out of my car to make the person that I just hit was okay. As soon as I put my foot on the ground, and pain struck through me.
I looked down and sure enough there was a gash in my left leg, but I didn't let it stop me to get to the other person. When I got there the door flew open. A short man that looked to be about in his 20's came out.
He rushed over to me to make sure I was okay. "I'm fine. Just a little scratch." I say. He looked down and saw my leg. "That is not just a scratch!" he said pointing to my leg. "Let me take you to the hospital."
Before I could argue my leg gave out and I smacked my head off of the road.
Then there was darkness.
