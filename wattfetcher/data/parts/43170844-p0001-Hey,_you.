The last time I'd seen Amelia, she was cowering in fear with tears streaming down her face as I stood over her. My friends stood back, watching with fear and amusement in their eyes. But I hadn't really intended to hurt her.
The bell rung, and my "posse" scurried off to their next class. As I watched them go, Amelia stood up and tried to shimmy past me, but I planted myself in front of her. Her headgear was slighted tilted, and her glasses were foggy with tears. I had though nothing of her at the time.
As I itched to get to math before the teacher called me out, I stepped aside and said "go." She ran away without hesitation. I felt a little guilty, but it wore off soon.
Now I was staring at someone who I wouldn't have thought I would ever see again after high school. I had spotted her from where I stood in the elegant backyard of my best friends, a married couple. Her thick black hair that used to be held back in cornrows was now free and snaked down her back, stopping at her butt. I quickly looked away from that area. I didn't want to be caught staring at her hind quarters.
When she turned her head, I saw a face that was in an expression that looked like she was about to burst out laughing. She had a wide smile with a perfect row of white teeth set within. Her eyes were a light blue, and her dark brown skin was dotted with freckles. God, she was stunning. But I couldn't bring myself to talk to her.
She leaned over to a tall, handsome man standing beside her, whispered something in his ear, then headed off towards the sliding back doors, probably to refill the empty glass in her hand. Before I knew what I was doing, I turned on my heel and followed her at a safe distance.
The long, black dress she was wearing twirled in the wind, revealing slender ankles clad in gladiator sandals. I so wanted to call out her name, but I just couldn't. She would recognize me as Johann, the boy who somewhat bullied her through all of middle school.
I had wanted to impress my friends, the popular group. I had the looks: Tall, brown hair, grey eyes, chiseled jaw, muscles, and what not. But I couldn't play the part. They wanted me to be mean, cocky, think I was better than everyone else. I wanted friends who I could sit with at lunch and play soccer with on the field. It was a win/win situation. Sort of.
I didn't really want to hurt her, but she was an easy target, so I pretended to be rude. It was all non-physical though. Teasing, name calling, that sort of thing. I felt guilty, but learned to live with it.
As I stared at the beautiful creature ahead of me, the guilt came rushing back, but I shrugged it off. I'll deal with that later, I told myself.
I busied myself, pretending to head to the bathroom, which was right by the kitchen. Instead I hid by the door, turned around, and pretended to walk by the kitchen. I gave her a sidelong glance, then pretended to just realize who she was.
"Amelia?" I said, startling her.
She looked at me for a moment, trying to remember who I was.
"I'm sorry, who are you?" Her voice was melodious, very calm and relaxing.
"It's Johann? Johann Parker? I went to Wickland Middle School?"
Her eyes widened with realization. "Oh my god, Johann? Is that you?"
She didn't get up and give me hug, like I expected her too. Hug me like everything was alright between us. She just stood there, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. The glass she was holding slipped from her hand, shattering on the floor and sending punch everywhere. She didn't seem to notice, or care for that matter.
"I can't believe this. It's really you. I never thought I'd see you again."
I smiled a little. "What a small world."
She then realized that there was broken glass all over the floor. "Oh, no. I have to get this cleaned up. Ah, um."
I moved to the storage closet down the hall and grabbed a broom. Sheila, the owner of the house, came running in.
"Wow. Okay, don't worry, we'll get the house keeper in here, you two just make your way back outside. We'll take care of this."
Amelia speed walked out of the house and disappeared into the crowd. I tried to follow her, but she seemed to have vanished. I retreated to the back table where I wallowed in my own guilt. She still remembered, and she still hated me.
