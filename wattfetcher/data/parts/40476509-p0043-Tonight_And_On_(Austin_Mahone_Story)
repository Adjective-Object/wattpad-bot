Amanda: Yeah, but I don't want to tell you.
Austin: Tell me, you need to tell me!
Amanda: Ok fine, I'll tell you...
She took a deep breath in and then breathed out.
Amanda: It was....... Zach.
I gasped and put one hand over my mouth, Sam stood in shock with his mouth wide open. Austin wrapped his arms around her waist and put his face in her lap. She tangled her hand in his hair.
Austin: No! No, no, no, no, no!!
Amanda: I tried to fight back but then he tied my wrist to the bed and then he........
Austin: Was it just him or was there more people?
Amanda: It was just him.
*3 Â½ hours later*
We hung out but we didn't crack jokes or anything. All we talked about was how Amanda got raped. To be honest I kind of had a feeling that it was Zach, I mean like he tried to ruin their relationship so he could be with her.
He's a true major douche bag. I don't think we'll ever forgive him for everything that has done. Amanda and Austin are in love, you could see it the minute you see them together and how they look into each others eye. They're ment to be and nothing or anyone can change that. The only person that could change that is God, and I don't think he would ever do that to them.
If he does do that, there is a specific reason. He always has reason for everything.We left and I was still in shock a bout everything, I just didn't know what to say, do, think about the situation.
