The horse galloped in circles around her, daring anyone to attack her... Or, in the matter of speaking, him.
I stumbled to a stop when I realized that I had been edging away from the horse without actually realizing that I had been.
The horse neighed as he spoke in my head, Yo, whazzup, dude? Imma gonna take milady to Poseidon's castle now. See ya sucka!
Well, hope you guys liked the chapter!!! <3
