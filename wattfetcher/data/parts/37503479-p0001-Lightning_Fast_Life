There are rumors that friends will never stay with you after you leave behind high school door. In reality, that rumor could be true but my friends and me will never split up until the death of us all. At least that is what I thought, but now I was wrong to think that was true... It was senior year, my boyfriend and I were always truthful to each other until the football after party. This party had everything drinks, drugs, you name anything illegal it and it was there. Many better looking girls than I was; if I dare say a lot better looking than I was. I was just your average "5/3" American girl who was really regretting to go to this after party. I only went because my boyfriend thought it would be nice to have the two of us go, together. Now I regret coming because I never thought it would come to this... There Nico was having kissing my best friend, Claire. I thought to myself, "after all these years I would find my boyfriend and my best friend kissing each other. Them probably thinking that I wouldn't know or even see what was going on between them. As soon as I was done thinking those words I would never have to think about I ran outside. While I was crumbling on the inside, I ran into Nico's truck and started driving. He obviously stopped his little todo and saw his car being stolen. He ran after his prized possession, after his beauty. I looked back to see if he was still chasing me, but didn't see him. Maybe I got away I thought, continuously. As I suddenly crashed into an large oak tree. The last thing I heard was "Everyone or anyone help and call 911", but those words soon faded after seconds.
