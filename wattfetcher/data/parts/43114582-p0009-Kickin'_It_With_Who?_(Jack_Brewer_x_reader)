"Why did you get me this shirt" you ask. "I don't know thought it was funny. Your funny. Boom You now have a spongebob shirt." You started laughing again. Then Jerry walked up to you and said "Y/n im sorry I shouldn't have gotten jealous in the first place I guess im not used to getting turned down." You could tell he was being serious. "I forgive you." You said as you hugg him. "Wanna spar ive gotten better." "Is that a joke cause if I can beat Jack you cant beat me." "Right. KIM! GET OUT HERE! " you laugh as Kim beats Jerry. But he was right he has gotten better. It was time to leave but you and Jack stayed for a bit longer. You we're practicing new moves. But when you went to drink your water Jack spilt some on you. You was in shock at first then darted to the back room. You groan as a f/c fish tail appears beginning at your waste. But you forgot to close the door before your tail appeared so Jack ran in saying "Y/n it was just water why did you ru- oh my god." He was in shock." Please dont tell anyone please dont please." He just walks closer to you and huggs you the says "if I told any one then I would lose you. Im not taking the chance of losing you." He kisses you gently. Then Bobby walks in the room and begins "y/n where are yo-" he stops as he sees your tail and Jack kissing you. "Uhhhhh" Bobby says in shock. "Hehe um yeah im a mermaid and Jack is my boyfriend hehe. Umm he." "Well ok then get rid of that tail so we can go and I trust Jack with you and im glad it isnt Jerry." He says as he leaves the room. Then the tail disappears and your legs come back.
