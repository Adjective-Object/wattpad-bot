Ryan's Pov:
As Toy Story finish, I look over at Hannah and Kayla. Thwy both fell asleep, but Kayla fell asleep with an oreo in her mouth. I laugh and shake my head. I go upstairs and open the guest bedroom soor, and rhwn i go back down grab Kayla and put her in the room. Then i do the same for Hannah but in another room. I grab their food and put it up.My phone started vibrating in my pocket, i pull it out and turns out to be Tessa.
Tessa: hey!☺
Ryan: hey Tessa😕
Tessa: whats wrong?😐😯
Ryan: Jenna broke up qith me.😢😢😶
Tessa: 😦😦😦😦😦Address. Now.
Ryan: No, youre not killing her!😱😨
Tessa: i aint killing anyone dummy.😣😣
Ryan; oh mine. Its 490 South 21st street red house on corner.😛
Tessa:Kk, be there in 5 minutes.🚗🚓🚓🚓
I put my phone on the table and start getting ready for Tessa. I get an Avengers mug for her and get out the food. I put on some Supernatural and go out on the porch and wait for her. Its a bit cold, so i go back inside and grab my hoodie.I got bored so I started playing Subway Surfers.
A flash of her headlights diverted my attention to her car pulling up the driveway. I stand up and put my phone back in my hoodie pocket. She walks out with McDonalds and bags of food. "So, Kaylas here too?" She said coming up the stairs. "Yup, and so is Hannah." I said opening the  door. She just nods and puts the bags in the dining room table. I turn my back away from, her so i can hang up my hoodie, and as soon as i turn around again she hugs me. Im surprised but i dont care i need someone to hug. We hug for like minutes, when we finally losen our hold on each other. "Tell me what happended." She aaid grabbing the McDonalds and sits down.
"Well, we were here and she said thay we need to talk. And she said that she was unhappy, and then she said that she was dating another guy, and that we should not even be friends and how shes moving to Billings, montana with the guy." I say tearing up. "Ryan, im so sorry. Youll be okay sooner or later." She said hugging me again. "Yeah well after he said that the guy came over to pick her up she said that she was never gonna see me again, and that she never loved me it was for my money." I said sobbing now. Tessa was now holding me so close, that I could smell her perfume, Pure Seduction from Victoria's Secret."Hey, Ryan. Itll be okay, i promise." She says grabbing my face with her 2 hands. "I know, but it hurts too much." I say pulling out of her gaze."I know, i know, but you can do this. Youre Batman." Tessa says. I laugh and sigh. She wipes away my tears and then starts eating again. "Supernatural. Classic man. " she says happily.
