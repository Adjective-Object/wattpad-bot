The awake is kind of fading. Idk. My chest feels really heavy this morning. I had another nightmare but I don't want to bother Jordan with it. He died. Yeah. He does that a lot in my dreams. Just this time I was there. I had the choice to save him and I didn't even move. I could've pushed him out of the way. It told me to stay still and watch. I wanted to move but I was frozen in place. Just. Statue. When I finally could move I walked over to what I assumed to be his corpse. I sat down by it and when I reached out to touch him he grabbed my wrist and said "you did this. You could've saved me. You could've been there." and then he went limp. I don't know what to make of it. I really don't. I'm just. Idk. Frazzled. I hate watching my friends die. Jordan is ridiculously important to me and seeing him die and then him telling me I could've stopped it just. Idk. I feel bad.
When I woke up I kind of freaked out. Just a bunch of crying and shaking and rocking back and forth. I wanted to kik him but I was scared to. I guess I'm back where I started.
