Alright, guys, when you read this, you'll notice that it isn't good. That's okay. Your novel is not supposed to be good.
NaNoWriMo is supposed to teach you to stop caring about your mistakes, to stop thinking about your flaws and bad characters and everything that will stop you from writing. You're supposed to learn not to care about others' opinions and your own misjudgment. In the end, you can edit and improve your work, but you can't improve what was never there.
Also, I'd really appreciate it if you read and comment on this work. It's kinda my child, you know? PS don't use font size 10 because it's tiny
