"I don't think I can.".
It was my last year of primary school, I knew I wouldn't start off were I left. Once I was their I was the freak of school all my friends had moved on quickly and I was alone. It was like I never escaped I still felt alone in this cruel world. Apart from a boy in year six called Brendon, he had dark black hair, strong features and large eyes but something felt off about him. It was probably the reason he was a social outcast. That's why we were friends.
And even though I tired to forget what happened, I would never tell anyone. I healed over time, using make up to conceal certain scars and using foundation to conceal my now permanently pale skin. I felt broken. I felt like I was broken a pieced together by a five year old. My parents, made my life difficult, luckily I was I only child so no one else heard them crying about me. But sometime for my parents sake I wish I wasn't they needed some one who was normal and not withdrawn.
But to be honest year seven was going to scare me because even with Brendon by my side, I was scared.
After all I was his favourite.
