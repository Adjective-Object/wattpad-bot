(Alexis Pov)
"Alexis wake up.School starts in an hour and you dont wanna be late for your first day at a new school".My mother says as i start getting ready for school.
I had just moved to Sydney, Australia With my mom and my new step dad about a week ago.I'm 16 and a very shy person i don't really socialize much unless I have to.I'm 5'2 and i have brown eyes and brown hair in my old school i wasn't populare but i wasnt a nerd either i just never wanted drama or anything like that.I have 2 bestfiends that were hard to leave back home but had no choice becuse my stepfather had a amazing job offering i mean im not complaining or anything because i need a new start with a new school and new friends.
"Bye mom Im leaving for school"I said walking out the door
As I started walking to my new school i see a tall blond haired person infront of me.He looked like he was my age mabey a year older im not sure thought.
