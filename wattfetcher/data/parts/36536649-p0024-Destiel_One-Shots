Cas was speechless.
"This silence isn't very encouraging," Dean said, slightly nervous.
"Oh! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, of course. I love you, Dean. I love you." Cas said finally.
"Oh, thank God," he said, "I was worried there for a se--!"
There wasn't a need for that sentence, because Castiel kissed off whatever else Dean was gonna say.
"Oh!" Cas said suddenly, his face lighting up with realization. "We're still on the air!"
"Oh, crap. Sorry folks." Dean hit a random button and music started playing.
It was a bad button.
Taylor Swift began to play on the all-classic-rock station. And it was an entire Taylor Swift playlist. It was 45 minutes in length.
Not that Dean or Cas noticed. You know, they were having engagement sex. Whoops.
Then Sam called.
"Dean!" he yelled as soon as Dean picked up.
"What?"
"What are you trying to do? First, a solid minute of you making out with your boyfriend, three minutes past the time your segment ends! NOW, FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN MINUTES, YOU'VE PLAYED TAYLOR FUCKING SWIFT."
"Okay, first of all, if you were actually listening, you'd know he's my fiance. And I'm not playing Taylor Swift. Duh.I'm not stupid."
"Are you sure? 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT TO ME."
Dean could tell Sam was bitchfacing him.
"I'm, like, ninety percent sure I'm not playing Taylor Swift."
"Okay, you know what? Take the day off. You and Cas. I'm coming in, with Charlie. Go. Now."
"Fine. Bye."
"Goodbye, Dean."
Called ended.
It really was a miracle that Dean could hold a conversation. Cas was trying to kiss(and suck) him the entire time.
"Hey, stop. Sam's gonna be here with Charlie any second now." Dean said seriously.
"Dean, we are both half naked."
"Then put on a shirt."
As soon as Sam and Charlie got there, Dean and Cas drove home. They only time Cas wasn't trying to get into Dean's pants was when he asked this:
"Hey, why'd Sam let us go anyway?"
"Oh, apparently, we were playing Taylor Swift." Dean replied.
Cas gasped. "Gabriel!"
"Your brother? What about him?" Dean asked.
"I let him come to the station yesterday. He's a bit of a trickster. I'm sorry."
"Hey, it's fine. Now we get to go home and have engagement sex!"
"I thought we already did that," Cas said with a smirk.
"There's never enough engagement sex, Cas. Never."

There's really nothing to say, except maybe...
"hnnnnnNNNNNNG"
"MY BEAUTIFUL GAY BOYS"
"*cries*"
Yeah maybe that
