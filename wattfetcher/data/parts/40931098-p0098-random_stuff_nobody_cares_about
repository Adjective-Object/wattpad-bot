I wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickCause I don't give a shitI wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickNo one would give a shitShort shorts, short skirtsFlower tops, denim shirtsIn the big city, nothing hurts, nothing hurts
When I was a little girl I wanted to be a citizen of the worldBeing busy with my job and my gay friendsLaughin' and drinkin' with my one night standsWhy are you looking as if I was abnormal?Oh yes, you're right, I've never tried to be normalI just wanna walk around free on my own paceI pay my bills with the money I make!
I wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickNo one would give a shitShort shorts, short skirtsFlower tops, denim shirtsIn the big city, nothing hurts, nothing hurts
I wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickNo one would give a shitShort shorts, short skirtsFlower tops, denim shirtsIn the big city, nothing hurts, nothing hurts
When I was 13, my brother moved to New York CityI dreamt so much about being there... and live the lifeI didn't have yet!Why are you looking as if I was abnormal?Oh yes, you're right, I've never tried to be normalI just wanna walk around free on my own paceI pay my bills with the money I make!
I wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickNo one would give a sh*tShort shorts, short skirtsFlower tops, denim shirtsIn the big city, nothing hurts, nothing hurts
I wish I would die my hair pinkPut on black lipstickNo one would give a sh*tShort shorts, short skirtsFlower tops, denim shirtsIn the big city, nothing hurts, nothing hurts
"Hey city grrrl... yeah, yeah you city grrrlHot on heels, don't how this tide will turnYou live your life to erase the lines of every lesson learnedSo put your lipstick on all over your teethCuz you're a natural disaster, no one's gonna cheatYou swear? Yeah, I swear. Just get in the groovy.
Don't live your life grrrl... unless it's just like a movie."

When I was 16, I finally moved to the big city!My dreams were screaming at my face:Heads up girl, you can rule this place!Can rule this place, can rule this placeHeads up girl, you can rule this place!Can rule this place, can rule this placeHeads up girl, you can rule this place!
