(listen to the song to set the mood)
Today was my last day of school. I watched guys walk 'their girls' home. I saw some people break down because they didn't get a boyfriend or girlfriend this year. It all made me kinda jealous and yes, I admit it. I feel jealous because people I know got relationships but I'm to ugly to get one. But things is... I don't complain. Some people think their ugly but they are FCUTE!!!! I'm serious when I say that I admit being ugly. I'm way too fat for my age and have pimples basically everywhere. I don't know what to say about anything else. But if you are beautiful and you don't admit it then I have some say to you. Look in the mirror and tell me what you see... I'm pretty sure that it's you. You are made to be beautiful and you better believe it. If someone tells you otherwise please punch them across the face for me okay? I've seen what ugly looks like and I bet that everyone reading this right now are the most beautiful people ever. I don't know how a beautiful person thinks their ugly. That's just crazy.
My dream is to get noticed. And no, not by my friends. I mean by a guy or someone else and I bet most of you guys agree with me. I love all of my readers to death. I assure you that the love of your life is right around the corner waiting to meet you. I'm staying single till the day I die but that doesn't mean you guys have to.
*hugs all readers* if I could give you your soulmate I would be like "SOULMATE!!! SELLING SOULMATES FOR FREE!!!!" but sadly I can't. Please don't give up on love. Just- just don't.
*Gives a bunch of ice cream and chocolates to readers* that's for you... and yes I'm sharing my ice cream with you.
Anyway that's all I wanted to say... BUH BAI!!! *waves everyone away*
