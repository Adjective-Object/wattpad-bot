The Terrible Experience
When we finally got at Georgia's house. Mya freaked out!She was so excited to see Georgia finally in a long time.As they were talking and catching up, I texted Jake and he didn't answer... I started to freak out! I didn't know what to do.So I asked Mya to come with me to his house.When I open the door(Because I had a key that he gave me just in case). I open the door, I went in all the rooms, and I saw him in his room...with some girl!I yelled,what is going on here!Jake answered,It's not what it looks like!ðŸ˜®I started crying,and left the room.Mya punched him, then went to see me.She asked if I was ok.I said,"obviously not!I thought we were a real couple...and not a fake one.I thought he loved me.I hate him!I wish I didn't spend any time with him!I wish I didn't waste my time!Why would he do it??!I need to text my family and tell them the weddings off."
