"Oi, Luffy. You did know what you just did?" Zoro asked.
"Yeah, I give Saki-chan meat because she's my friend!"
"We're your friend and you don't give us meat!"
"Really? I thought you didn't like meat." Luffy answered watching the crew as clueless as ever. Why were they making such a big fuss? All he did was give Saki-chan meat.
"Sakura-chan! I will give you meat for the rest of your life!" Sanji exclaimed, spinning over to Sakur then kneeling down and holding her hand.
"Really? Arigatou Sanji-san!" Sakura exclaimed cutely sparkling. In that moment,
"No way! I will give Saki-chan meat!" Luffy exclaimed. Robin chuckled at this sudden development and Nami was just left to wonder.
"What's going on here?" Aya asked as she and Haruka approached the seat.
"Luffy gave me meat and Sanji-san said that he'd give me meat for the rest of my life and I'm so happy~" Sakura explained, slowing swaying with the piece of meat in her hands.  Her eyes were so filled with happiness and wonder that one could barely recognize that is was her.
The Sea-Train started off and violently went down the Milky Road until it harshly impacted the sea. The Train then continued well on its way to the resort.
-------------------------
"Sugoi." Aya and Sakura sighed as they stood in the entrance of the train station facing the island. The island was lush in vegetation and was overflowing with various wildlife from different islands. The resort was clearly seen as the villas dotted the mountain side.  The island's beaches had pure white sand that almost looked like snow and clear, sparkling blue waters. There were plenty of fauna on the beach too as some students spotted rare crabs and the various fish, each having their own beauty to them. It was rumoured that some mermaids live here to take care of the beautiful corals and the aquatic wildlife. No one ever knew if that was true but to the minds of others.
"Of course, a mermaid must live in this Paradise! If a mermaid lives here then I have finally found my All Blue!" Sanji exclaimed.
"I've never seen a mermaid before but I have seen Fishmen. Are they really that beautiful?" Sakura asked Aya, the former resting on a wooden fence overlooking the sea and the latter standing next to her.
"Of course they are but there were two at the Maid Caf√© remember? They were Keimi and Shirahoshi."
"Really? I didn't see them. I was getting rid of the sake remember?" Sakura answered.
The students continued their walk to the resort's lobby. Along the way, they noticed zoos, aquariums, multiple restaurant, natural baths and even some adventures for thrill seekers.
"Why wasn't I told about this resort before?" Sakura asked as she awe at everything.
"Its quite popular, everyone knows about it."
"You have to be living under a rock to not know about it." Haruka added heartlessly. Unknowingly, he touched a very sensitive nerve in Sakura's being.
"That's right.Living under a rock."
"No matter. I'm gonna enjoy this fucking place!" Sakura exclaimed, fist pumping the air.
"Language." Aya said slapping her.

"Welcome students to Akane Resorts." Mihawk welcomed looking very unwelcoming,"These will be your supervisors. I expect you to be on your best behaviour. Now go have fun. You only have one day."
