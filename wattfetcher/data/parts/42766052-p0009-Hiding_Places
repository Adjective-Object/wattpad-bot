Damn I was pathetic.
Why was I so stupid as to go to her house?
I was so stupid.
So fucking stupid.
I felt my pocket.
I could feel the box in there.
The box of dreaded cigarettes.
She hated them.
So much.
I loved it.
Because she hated it.
I wasn't even running my own life.
She was.
She made my choices.
She was my commander.
With her on my mind I would always do what she wants.
Or the opposite.
It wasn't my hand that compelled me.
But it was her hand that compelled me to lay against the side of a building.
And take a long drag of a cigarette.
All because of her.
And her hate for these cigarette.
