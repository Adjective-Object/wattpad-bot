Since you guys probably didn't take the time to read the discription I'm going to put it in here. Hope you enjoy this story, I will update randomly, so it doesn't go with a scheldule.
Samantha, or Sam, was like any average 17 year old. She goes to school, is in some extra curricular activities, band and choir, and there is one thing that keeps her different. She is a total fangirl. She loves O2L, Connor Franta, Jennxpenn, Andrea Russet, thatssojack, well, just YouTube in general. She even makes her own videos, except for the fact that it has terrible quality because it is recorded on her phone. Her parents never really had much money but what will happen when one splurge that her parents do turns her world upside down?
