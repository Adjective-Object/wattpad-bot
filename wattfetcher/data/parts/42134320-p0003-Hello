"Just tell me, Mike." I sighed hungry and impatient, wondering how bad it could be.
"He got busted for smoking pot. Crownmin smelt it on him." He winced, thinking I would freak out.
In reality though I had about a second of self restraint before I burst out laughing. "That's it? That's all you're worried about?" I sighed and opened my door. I looked back and saw Mike's overly confused face. "While I would never do drugs I'm not going to judge someone solely on it. Stepping out into the cool drizzle I said what he needed to hear. "I'm not the same person I was before. You missed alot, and I don't think you know me as well as you used to anymore."
I closed the door and turned around. I couldn't look back at Mike's face. I knew it was heartbroken and confused. I knew it was trying to figure that last year of my life out. If I had it my way he'd never know.

A/N: So the way this will work will that their be a song that is relevent to each chapter hence chapter names. I'll leave a video above ^^^ (so used to saying 'to the side') The whole story on the other hand sparked from the song I Just Came to Say Hello. And ta da! You have this. Pic above is Tessa, otherwise known as Willa Holland.
