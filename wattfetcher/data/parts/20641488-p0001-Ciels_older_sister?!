Hi there!!! My name is Cielin Eve Phantomhive! I am 19. My parents died in the manor .The same exact manor  I lived in with my little brother, and on that day it was his birthday and I was planing to bring him something he always wanted, this little teddy bear that had bunny ears and a top hat! But when I came back to the manor I found out that there came a fire that burned the  whole manor. The only this that was found was ashes from my mom and dad. Yet to this day the whole story changed, I was told that Ciel went with my parents up in the sky but know I know other wise! Ciel, my little brother was still alive and now with a butler all dressed in black! So, I was thinking, and promise not to tell anyone, I was going to go to the manor on Ciels birthday ,which is 2 days away, tell him I'm his sister and give him the teddy bear I still had! I know he's like what? 14? But he never got that present when he was little so it's the least I could do! So, are u in?
