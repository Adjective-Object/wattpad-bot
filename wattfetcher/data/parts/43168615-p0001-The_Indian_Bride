We met, laughed, enjoyed being around one another, and most importantly, loved each other. We made many memories too.
Only for it to be taken away in a split second because of my father and his promises.
We made a promise too, we promised that we would always be together no matter what and that i would be his and he would be mine.
Will there promises get fulfilled?
