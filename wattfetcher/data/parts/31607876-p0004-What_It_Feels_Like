She paints a pretty picture But the story has a twistHer paint brush is a razorAnd her canvas is her wrist.
She paints her pretty pictureIn a color that's blood redWhile using her sharp paint brushShe ends up finally dead.
Her pretty pictures fadingQuite slowly on her armThe blood is not racing through herShe can no longer do harm.
She painted her pretty picture But her picture had a twist Her mind was her razorAnd her heart was her wrist.
