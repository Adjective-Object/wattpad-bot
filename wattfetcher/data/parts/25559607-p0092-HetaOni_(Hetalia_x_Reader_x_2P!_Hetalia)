Prussia gave a puzzled look. "The basement? Can't you just talk here?"
"It's really important, so... please. I feel I'll only be able to talk if we're there." Italy pleaded.
______ was about to speak up about something that the Italian said, but decided against it. Instead, she waited for them to continue their discussion.
Germany gave in, "Hmph. I see. Then let's all head down there. But before that, I also have somewhere I want to go."
"Where?" England asked.
"The cave with the burnt ropes. I saw something lying on the ground, but I couldn't pick it up at the time."
Japan nodded. "All right. Let's all go together, then."
Italy gave a smile. "Yeah! ... Thank you."

They headed for the tunnel in the basement with rope ladder.
"What's the matter, Germany?"
Germany shrugged. "Nothing... I mean, well...I just wanted to remove the obstacle that made me fall over yesterday."
Japan nodded. "I see. That's a good idea. Someone could trip over it and get hurt."
"Yes, exactly... but... it's odd.I can't find a single vine or stone." Germany told them while crouching down and searching the floor for anything.
Prussia cringed. "Whaat?!What the hell, it's like a horror movie! Stop saying those things!"
"Well, it's dark here. Did you look properly?" Russia asked.
"I'm sure it was right here. But there's nothing. No obstacle.
There is no stone, no vine, nothing. One could even think there was never anything to begin with." Germany reassured them.
Italy looked down and thought to himself, "(...... That's right.)
(Even if we try to find it where Germany didn't fall, we'll never find anything. But when he fell, there was something entwined around his foot that wouldn't let him move.)
(It's as if--)"
France gulped and started to shiver a bit. "Euh, it's like someone tripped you and wouldn't let you move."
Germany stood up and looked uneasy. "A-actually... I only assumed it was a vine, but now that I think about it... well...
It felt
...like someone had grabbed my ankle..."
America shrieked, "Eeeek!! Stop, stop!! Let's stop talking about this! There's nothing here! Can't we just leave it at that?!"
Russia tapped his chin and spoke in a playful manner. "Grabbed... It's like... a hand sprang up from the earth and grabbed your ankle~"
"And tried to drag you into the earth..." France added.
Germany shivered at the thought. "Aaaargh!! S-stop! It could have been just my imagination! Anyway!! There's nothing out of the ordinary here! Let's leave it at that!"
Japan nodded. "I-indeed! Now, let's go to the place where Italy will talk to us..."
"Hm? Oh, sorry! Um, the cell where Prussia and the others had got in. That's where I want us to go." Italy told them.
