We walked through the doors the experience was infront of us it was my favourite, "oh my god I want to go on that one," I said getting excited and pointing at the ride, "where is my aunt Jen I need my money for tokens," why did she have to leave with my bag?
"It's okay I'll buy you some," Mark said pulling me towards the line, "no, it's okay," I waved him off but he insisted, "fine," "thank you," he smiled, "2 bags of 50 please," he said to the woman at the counter, she batted her eyelashes at him, "sure sweet thang," I rolled my eyes at her, sweet thang really, I scoffed, "who's the other for?" She said ignoring me, "my finance," he said pulling me towards him wrapping his arm around my waist, I fake smiles at her and she gave me a dirty look, "here," she threw them on the counter "next," Mark put the money in the counter and grabbed the tokens, "here," he smiled and handed me my tokens, "lets get in the line," I nodded and followed him,
We gave the tokens and got in I took of my shoes and left all my stuff down that could fall out of my pockets on the floor, I walked to the rides seat and tried to pull myself onto the ride but failed, I huffed, mark chuckled and walked over to me, he lifted me up and put me in the seat, he laughed and clapped my hands,
The thing that holds you in went down and I held it against my stomach making sure it was in properly, the ride lifted and our feet dangled so we couldn't reach the floor, the arms extended out and the seats leaned forward, my adrenalin disappeared and was replaced with fear, this is this moment I regret going on the ride, "oh my god I want off," I heard Mark chuckle at my fear and the arms of the ride started to go round fast,
I grabbed onto marks hand that was holding on to the bars on the seat protected thing, i squeezed it tightly and that's when the ride turned our seats upside down, I screamed as the blood rushed to my head and then back down to my toes, it turned is upside down many more times, along with us going around in a circle very fast,
The seat turned upside down but didn't go back up it kept going round in a circle fast while we where upside down, I swear when I get off this going to be sick, we turned back over and it finally came to a stop, i let go of marks hand and rubbed the sweat of my hands on my trousers, I tried pushing myself out of the seat but the thing sticking out of the chair was to high for me to get past, I crossed my arms and pouted Mark looked at me and walked towards me, "I love the way your so small," he laughed and bent down his lips brushed my pouted ones and I pulled my head away, his eyes widened at the realisation at what he did he helped me down and left me standing like an idiot,
The worker was getting impatient so I slipped on my last shoe and grabbed everything quickly and ran out to catch up with him, "Mark wait, please," I shouted after him he stopped and turned, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to I didn't ask to love you," "Mark," I pulled his chin towards me so he would look at me, "look Mark, I hate loving you it hurts so much you don't understand the pain I have when I see you or when your name is mentioned, I didn't ask for it either," he looked at me with his sparkling blue eyes a mixture of sadness and lust, his pupils where diluted, "I wish we could be friends but we can't," he frowned and looked away but I pulled him back, "I will let you explain, tonight, maybe we can consider this as a, a date?" He smiled a little and pulled me into a hug, "I hate loving you too," he laughed and so did I,
"What's going on here," I turned my head and my aunt Jen was standing with Harley and Xander, mark slowly put me down and I blushed, "nothing," "okay, I'm taking Harley to the cars so where will I meet yous?" I turned and looked at Mark, "the hotel at?" "7 cause it's 2 now," Mark said, my aunt nodded and took Harley and the pram down to the other park, "so dodgems?" I smiled at marks request, and we went to the dreadful bumper cars.
