"Jeff, we've been doing this for hours, we have 2 hours until the roads become busy again." I tell him.
He pays no attention as he continues to flip through the files.
"Jeff we're not going to find anything." I say, again.
He continues to ignore me.
"Jeff! Will you stop!' I shout.
"Shut the fuck up, will you!? I'm doing this for you! We still have 130 files and 2 hours! So instead of sitting on your ass bitching at me, why don't you help!?" He snaps.
I'm taken a back by his outburst, and remain still and silent.
"I'm.." Jeff sighs. "I'm sorry, okay? Will you.. please help?" He asks.
I nod and help him look.
"What," I say quietly. "What about her?" I ask, showing him a file.
Jeff gives it a quick look. "No, you're 5"5. She's 5"6." He rejects it.
"Jeff she's the closest thing we have. My last doctor's visit was in 11th grade, they don't know if I've grown or not." I tell him. "Please? I'm tired and I just want this to be over." I ask, putting my hand on his.
Am I flirting?
Jeff swallows and takes his hand away. "Fine, let's go."

Jeff's POV
"Joana Isaac.. Areas of choice, South Side, Downtown, and Breck Town." She read off of the notepad. I told her she couldn't take the file. She has her white hair pulled into a bun that sits on top on her head. I like when its like this. All disheveled and messy, its really..cute.
"I know where she would be." I tell her. "The abandoned highway overpass a little way out of town? She should be there."
"How do you know?" She asks me.
"I'm a serial killer, dear." I laugh. "I know people. I know how to locate people, certain groups of people."
"You're very smart." She tells me.
"I know." I say smugly.
"What if I-" She stops and looks forward. "Is.. Is that her?" I point ahead of me. A black haired woman stood in front of a fire.
"Let's find out." I shrug. "Joana?" I ask her.
She turns to us confused. "Yes? What do you want?"
I walk up to her and smile. "Oh, nothing." I grab her head and slam it against the brick wall behind her. This doesn't phase Lena at all as I throw her body over my shoulder. "Lets go."
"Mommy?" We hear a small voice behind us. We turn to see a small boy looking up at us with wide eyes. "Who are you? Where are you taking mommy?" He asks us.
Shit. She has a kid.
I pull out my knife. "No witnesses." I say walking towards the boy. Lena pulls me back.
"Jeff are you serious? He's a child, no more than four or five years old." She says, looking at the child with pity.
"Lena you can't be sensitive to these kinds of things." I sigh. Why does she have to have fucking feelings?
"At least let him see the world before you take him from it." Lena crosses her arms.
"What do you want me to do? He saw us! Which means he can identify us Lena!" I whisper-yell.
