Start of story
One nice day at Shredder's beach, Austin and Dez are digging in the sand when Austin hit something
Austin: Huh? I think I hit something
Dez: let's find out
They both dig really quickly and when they finished digging, they found a old golden guitar
Dez/Austin: woah
Austin: a golden guitar
Dez: not just any golden guitar, its a guitar that was hidden for 100 years
Austin: awsome
Dez: and you have found it
Austin: yup, let me try it just to make sure (strums it) woah, it sounds perfect, im keeping this
Suddenly, the guitar mysteriously disappeared
Austin: huh?
Dez realized that the guitar disappeared from Austin's hands and that's a sign that a curse from a legend
Dez: Austin, you heard
Austin: what is it Dez
Dez: I heard that when the guitar disappeared, there has been a curse and who ever found the guitar will get bad luck for 2 weeks and you got the curse
Austin: oh Dez, stop making stories up, i don't think I got bad luck, I think I'm going to swim for a while
Dez: all right, if you say so
Few minutes later Austin went a little too far from the shore and nearly drowned. Few seconds later, a big wave dragged him a little farther away from the shore and starting to drown
Austin: uh oh (drowning) DEZ HELP ME, IM DROWNING
Dez didn't hear Austin yelling for help and keep on building a sandcastle
Austin: HEEELLLLLP, IM DROWNING
A lifeguard noticed that someone is drowning
Lifeguard: oh my god, someone's drowning (quickly grabbed a surfboard and quickly went to the ocean and save the kid from drowning)
When the lifeguard went to the ocean, Austin already had drowned and sunk to the bottom of the ocean
Lifeguard: oh dear, I got to find the kid who drowned (jumps into the ocean)
Few minutes later, the lifeguard found the drowned kid and dragged him back to shore and did some CPR. Few seconds later Austin was starting to cough water out of his lungs
Austin: (coughing) what happened
Lifeguard: you drowned and blacked out under water
Austin: oh (gets up) thanks for saving my life
Lifeguard: next time, don't go too far from the shore
Austin: ok, I won't (walks away)
Few minutes later Austin went to Dez's sandcastle and crushed it
Austin: Dez let's go back to sonic boom
Dez: awww, you crushed my sandcastle
Austin: come on, let's go
Dez: fine
At Sonic Boom Austin and Dez walked in the store and Austin tripped over himself and fell
Dez: told you got a bad luck
Austin: Dez, i told you that is not bad luck, it's just that I tripped over my legs
Dez: oh but if you fall down one more time, I swear it's bad luck
Austin: fine, whatever you say
Dez: hey Ally
Ally:
