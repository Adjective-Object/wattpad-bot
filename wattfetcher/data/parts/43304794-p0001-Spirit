On March 17, 2000, a young girl was born. She was a small baby with shock red/orange hair and bright green eyes. Her mother named her Scarlet. Scarlet grew up very strong but skinny, almost scrawny. She would be scrawny if it weren't for her strength and exercise. She loved meat, but would eat vegetables if she had to. Her hair was long, but thin and silky, so it was easy to brush. She always had it in a pigtail and sometimes would braid the pigtail. She loved sports, and she was the best runner on track team. She was also a big nerd, and had skipped a grade, and she was still in all advanced classes.
She lived in Florida and loved to go on early morning and afternoon runs on the beach. It was the end of the summer and Scarlet was extremely nervous about going into middle school since the middle school where she lived combined four different elementary schools. People from the other schools didn't know her, they weren't used to her and how she had skipped second grade.
The next day was the huge summer dance that she threw every year the day before the first day of school. Everyone from her grade was invited, and it was a whopping seven hours of fun on the beach. It started at noon and went until seven that night, lunch and dinner included. Everyone loved it, it was the big event of every year. She had just finished watching TV and doing some programming on her laptop when her mom told her to get some sleep before the big day. She smiled and nodded, "Night mom!" Her mom kissed her forehead and she ran up and quickly got ready for bed, then leaped into bed and fell asleep.
