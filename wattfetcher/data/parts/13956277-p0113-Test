I smiled, "Thank you" I tasted the coffee, "That's not coffee, that's strawberry juice" I frowned, "Yeah, just in case you were going to throw it over me again so I don't get burnt" He chuckled and I laughed, I looked at my cousins Who were absolutely shocked, "Hi there, here are your cakes and juices" Simon smiled at them, Amal pinched my arm as I was sitting on a chair beside Simon, "Hi, I'm Leena's boyfriend" Simon smiled and I punched his arm, Zainab and Amal gasped, "Shut up, they understand English better than both of us" I said and he laughed, "Sorry, just kidding, I'm Leena's friend, from America" He chuckled, "This handsome young man has been standing beside me and protected me since I went to America, if he was Muslim I might have married him long time ago" I laughed, Simon's eyed widened, "WHAT?" Zainab and Amal said loudly, "Sorry, I become way too honest after 2 am" I chuckled, "He's not Muslim ? And he's your friend ? And you brought him to your house too ! What's wrong with you?" Zainab said, "At least he cares more than both of you do" I took a sip from my juice, "Hey, Ladies,  don't fight over me, I know I'm hot but, seriously, don't ruin your friendship because of me" Simon combed his hair with his hand, "SHUT UP" Me and my cousins said in silence, "Okay ..." Simon stared at the three of us are he slowly put the cake in his mouth, suddenly the 4 of us exploaded in laughter, "Stop, don't make me laugh, my parents just died" and then, my laugh turned into tears, "The sad thing is all my relatives are waiting for me to  collapse so they take over everything, instead of standing beside me and wiping my tears, what are their hearts made off? I bet it's not blood and muscles" I sobbed, my cousins hugged me and gave me some tissues, Simon was just looking at me with his beautiful eyes, his eyes were sparkling because of the tears trying to get out, Simon's phone rang "It's Molly" He said then answered, "Hi, yeah I'm fine .... she's fine too, wait a second" Simon gave me the phone, "She wants to talk to you",  "Hi" I sniffed,  "I'm sorry for your loss" I sensed Suffocation in her voice, my voice started crashing, "SIMON" I heard Karam shout, "I have to hand up bye" I gave Simon his phone, "He's looking for me, what should I do ?" He started shaking, "Get out, jump" I said and he did, "Hide the cake" I told my cousins then I opened the door, I saw Karam on walking from a room to another, He told me he was looking for Simon, "Hi" Simon got in from the front door, "Where were you?" Karam asked, "I was walking around the house, why ? Anything wrong?" Simon was such a great actor, "No, I just woke up and didn't
Find you in your room" Karam yawned so did Simon, "You know, I'm not used to the time here, it's morning in America now" Simon explained.
*Day 2 of the funeral*
Zainab told me that breakfast was ready but I wasn't hungry, or should I say, I didn't want to eat ...
"Goodmorning" Simon got out of his room shirtless, "ARE YOU CRAZY ! HOW DARE YOU GET OUT LIKE THIS ? THIS ISN'T YOUR OWN HOUSE, GET INSIDE AND PUT SOMETHING OVER YOU. This is a funeral house, you should respect it, what if Karam comes out and sees you like this ?" I scolded him and he headed to his room silently. "He's good looking though" Amal was checking him out, "Can you not? It's not time for flirting and throwing yourself over guys" I said rudely, Amal got offended and walked out.
People started coming, Simon was standing beside Karam, helping him, offering coffee and dates, he was way more helpful than any of my male cousins and relatives, he didn't whimper about anything, he was doing it without being told to.
*Day 3*
My aunts were gathered around me, trying to convince me to eat something, but I refused, I didn't feel a need for food, neither for water, depression was controlling me. Two of my aunts kept insisting on staying with me for the night, though I didn't want them too, because I knew the true reason behind their request, it wasn't because they wanted to take care of me of because they were worried about me, but it was because the lawyer was coming the next day.
