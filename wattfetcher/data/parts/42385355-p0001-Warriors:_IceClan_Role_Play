Welcome to Iceclan rp!
Some basic rules are:NO SWEARING! Warrior terms are fine, but nothing other than that. These are cats, not humans.
Remember to tag the next person after you comment so they know it is their turn.
Also, if you have a leadership position(medicine cat/apprentice, leader, or deputy), make sure you are on at least once a week.Â  Otherwise, you might miss something important.
However, if you know ahead of time that you will be gone for a while, and you have a leadership position, pm me so I know you will be gone and so I can plan for what can happen while you are gone( like getting a replacement leader, or making the deputy lead for a time, making a replacement deputy, or saying the medicine cat/cats are collecting herbs).
Thanks! If you want to join, fill out the form in the next chapter.
