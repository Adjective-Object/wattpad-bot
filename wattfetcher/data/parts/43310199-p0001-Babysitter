"No! Please don't leave!!" I plead. "We have too sweetie! It's for mommy and daddy's job!" My father tells us. "Ally don't worry we found a spectacular baby sitter!" "I'm going to miss you." I say. "We're going to miss you too sweetie! We'll be ba-" my mother gets cut off by the sound of the doorbell. "That must be the babysitter!" My mother says with joy. How can she be so happy she leaving Lexi and I alone with a stranger for two weeks just so they can go to Paris! I begged and begged for them to stay but they won't budge! "Hello Mr and Mrs Apple!" She says. "Oh please! Call me Sarah!" My mother says. "And me John!" My father says. "Oh-haha! John. Like Johnny Appleseed!" She laughs."No! John Apple! My father says in a stern tone. He hates it when people do that. I look up and look at the babysitter. She's actually kind of pretty. Blonde hair and big green eyes. Her skin is perfect. Wow. Her pretty face starts coming towards me. "And what's your name little cutie?" She asks. "Umm, my name is Ally." I say. "Awe. Your so cute!" She says and touches my nose. "Stop!" I yell. "Oh, um. I'm sorry..." She says looking at my parents. My dad glares at me. I glare back. "Well!" My mother says. "I'm sure you two will get along just well." She says with a fake smile. "Why don't we go wake up Lexi and say bye." My father suggest. "Oh splendid!" My mother exclaims. "Who's Lexi?" The babysitter whispers. "My sister..." I say. "Wait...there's two of you." "Umm, yea. What did you expect. Did you read the 7 page essay my mom sent you?" I ask. "Well, umm, no..." She replies. "Well Lexi is my 2 year old baby sister. Dirty blonde hair-like me-and brown eyes." I state. "Do you guys look alike? You sound alike. Both have brown hair, brown eyes." "Yea, now that I think about it we kind of do look alike. But I'm 9 and she's 2. Big difference!" "Hey, I have a 12 year old brother named Zac. Both 7 years apart.""So I'm Ally and Lexi, and your... Umm- wait what's your name?""Regan.""Regan?""Yep!""Regan and Zac" I say. I hear my little sister crying from her room. "She's up!" I exclaim.  My parents come running out of the room. "We're late! We got to go!!" My father shouts. My mother hands Lexi to Regan. "I love you Ally, see you later Lexi!! I love you!" My parents say as they rush out the door. "And then there were three..." Regan says. "How about we go get ice cream?" Regan suggest. "Really! Mommy never lets me get ice cream! She says its 'unhealthy'." "Well I think ice cream is very healthy!" Regan says. I'm starting to like her. "Hey Lexi," she whispers. "Want to go get ice cream?""I ceam!!" Lexi yells.
After we got ice cream we all headed back home. It was pretty late Lexi fell asleep in the car, and I watched the moon follow us home. Why does the moon do that? It's like a secret spy the follows you everywhere and watches you in your sleep. It's weird. But I like it. When we get home I get into my bed and huddle all my stuffed animals next to me. Regan comes in. "Hey I put your sis to bed. She was tired." Regan whispers. I just smile. I lay down and close my eyes. I hear her faintly sigh and then whisper "Goodnight Ally." And before she leaves I whisper. "Goodnight."
