"W-What..?"
"Im going to have to punish you Shea" he whispers in my ear before softly kissing the hickey he had left on me.
"Haha stop it" I giggle as I push him away rolling my eyes, a smirk on his face. "Damnnn looks like Seth Morbin's starting to act himself!" She jokes before sticking her tongue out at him. He shakes his head with a smirk and runs towards me, making my eyes widen and run away from him.
Im laughing and giggling loudly and Seth catches up, picking me up and throwing me over his shoulder. "S-Seth! Haha put me down!" I giggle loudly, next thing I know he slaps my ass and I scream, a deep blush on my cheeks.
Seth makes that weird clicking noise with his tongue and shakes his head with a smirk. "Bad girl! No screaming in tue house" He tells me before throwing me down on the couch. Hes quickly ontop of me and before I can say a word, his fingers are at it and tickling me.
"S-Seth!! Bahah no!!! Please! Stop!" I laugh loudly, squirming and wiggling around. "B-Baby please! Hahaha stahhhhhp!" I laugh loudly and try to push him off. My fingers start to tickle his sides and her jerks.
"Oh no you dont!" He laughs. I softly blush because of his laughing, his smile, he's so friken handsome..
My laughs get louder and so do his as I keep going. His tickles stop and he grabs my hands quickly pinning them above my head.
"Bad bad girl" He chuckles softly.
