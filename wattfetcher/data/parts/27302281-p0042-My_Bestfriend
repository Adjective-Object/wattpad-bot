I  waited till he finished and he stared at me awaiting my approval
" did you write that " I said suprised that my best friend had kept this from me ...that he has a unbearable talent that could blow millions away like he did me  I'm sooo shocked that I never knew....that he never told me I snapped out of my thoughts  by justin
" Kylie  " justin said snapping his fingers  in front of my face obviously annoyed because I zoned out
" sorry  so did you  write that" I asked apologizing
" yeah " he said slyly
" oh so who's it about " I said curiously
"   you"  he answered
Then his mom walked in with dessert  before I could say anything not that I could cause he wrote a song about me I wonder when he wrote it   I thought to myself
Justin POV
" sorry  so did you  write that"  kylie asked apologizing
" yeah " I  said slyly
" oh so who's it about " she asked  obviously curious
"   you"  I answered
Then I stopped awaiting her response but my monwalked in with deserts
Perfect timing mom
I thought sarcastically
" sorry guys did I interrupt"  my mom said politely
" yes " I said rudely
" justin " Kylie yelled me then added "  that's  rude "
" sorry mom I love you " I said getting up to give her an apologetic hug
" good boy"my mom said
" I love you too" my mom added smiling at me
" how about this movie" I added restarting the movie and joining Kylie on the opposite couch  and pulled her close to me as  my mom handed her  dessert  then my mom turned the lights and  sat on the opposite couch
Kylie POV
I cuddled into justin as the movie started and he played with my hair and sang softly in my ear  so his mom couldn't hear
"Cause baby when you're with me
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)
Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better"
And. I just smiled like an idiot for a few seconds then looked up at justin and smiled
" I love you" he said kissing
my forehead softly
" love you too " I smiled then returned my view to  the TV
