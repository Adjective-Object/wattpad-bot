Victorias POV
"Victoria wake up" I heard my best friend Crystal say while shaking me. " Victoria please wake up " Crystal said. " VICTORIA WAKE UP YOU LAZY ASS " Crystal screamed making me groan while sitting up.
" Gosh what do you want Crystal ? "I asked my best friend.
" Get up we are going shopping!! "I rolled my eyes at her .
" You woke me up to go shopping ? "" Couldn't you wait until later ? " I asked her . Now it was her turn to roll her eyes.
" No , now wake up and get dressed."Crystal said with a smile on her face.
" Fine " I pushed the duvet off of me and I got up from my bed . " Get out so I can get dressed " I said . Crystal got off of my bed and headed towards the door . Before she left she turned around and looked at me before she spoked.
" Hurry up " Crystal told me but I flicked her off. When she got out of my room I went to my closet and picked out an outfit to wear . Then i went to get underwear. When I got all my clothes set out I looked for my towel and headed towards the bathroom thats down the hall . I got in the bathroom and locked the door , I put the towel on the toilet and started to strip out of my pijamas.
I turned the shower on so that the water was a little warm . I scrubed my body with soap then I washed my hair and I rinsed it off . I got out of the shower and wrapped the towel around my body . I walked over to the sink so i can brush my teeth . I looked at myself in the mirror .
Im 18 , I have long brown hair which is wavy that reaches just below my breasts, light brown eyes and my skin tone was a little pale, I am skinny. I picked up my toothbrush and the toothpaste and started to brush my teeth .
When I was done I put on my clothes . It was a tight white shirt that stopped on top of my bellybutton that was pierced , with a ripped blue skinny jean and my white converse . As I finished putting on my clothes I unlocked the bathroom door and headed towards my room.
I hanged my towel on the door of my room and went to the mirror and started to apply makeup . It was just a little bit of eye liner on the top and on my water line to make my blue eyes pop out more . I also added mascara and shinny lipstick . Then I brushed my hair and let it air dry .
I finnished and went to my nightstand to get my phone . I put it in my back pocket and I went towards my door .When I was about to open it , someone pushed it opened and hit me in the face which caused me to fall to the floor.
" OUCH ! " I said . It was Crystal who hit me with the door . When she realized she hit me , she started to laugh like a crazy women ." It's not funny " I said and pouted .
" I'm sorry but it is funny " she said in between her laughs . I got up and rolled my eyes and headed outside my room . I went down the stairs to the front door while Crystal followed me . We headed outside mine and Crystal's appartment . It was so hot outside , well what did I expect it's Summer and were in California .
" Katy is gunna meet us at Starbucks " Crystal informed me , I nodded .
" Should we walk or take the car ? " I asked Crystal . She pointed to the car so I guess we are taking the car . I got in the passenger seat because Crystal wanted to drive so I let her . She started to drive to the mall which only took like 7 minutes to get there . I got out of the car and Crystal did the same . We headed inside the mall and started to walk towards Starbucks . When we got there we started to look for Katy .
Katy is mines and Crystal's friend . As soon as we spotted her we walked towards her .
" Hey Guys " Katy said smiling .
