it was looking at the models in the pictures
and throwing up after
it was wanting to be someone new
and loosing herself along the way
it was an ending friendship
sooner than expected
it was memories
that ate her away
it was the sorrow
that left her empty
it was the deterioration of a once promising girl, into a heartless fiend
