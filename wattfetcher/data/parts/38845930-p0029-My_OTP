Jordan's POV
"Put on the movie!" Boo begged.
"Okay, I'm comin'." I said.
About half way through the movie, I noticed Erin fell asleep.
"Babe?" I asked. Nope, fast asleep.
"Mommy?" Boo asked.
"I think she's asleep." I whispered.
"Oh." She said.
After the movie ended she was still fast asleep leaning on my shoulder.
"You can go play with your toys in your room if you want." I told Boo.
"Thanks, Jordan!" She screamed before I shushed her.
"Erin?" I whipsered.
"No." She said with a really annoyed face. I tickled her to get her to wake up.
"You up now?" I asked.
"Stop!" She yelled with an annoyed face that turned into a smile.
"Well, good morning." I said.
"Oh, morning. Sorry" Erin said before kissing me.
"Is mommy awake?" Boo asked.
"I'm awake." Erin responded. Boo ran over and jumped onto the couch in between me and Erin, we all snuggled for a while.
"This is nice, the three of us snuggling. I haven't snuggled like a family in a while, not since I was a kid." I said.
"I haven't for a while either." Erin said.
"Are you gonna be my new daddy?" Boo asked.
"Boo!?" Erin exclaimed.
"I -- maybe, in a long time I -- it could happen." I said.
"Really?" Both of them asked.
"Yeah, it could happen." I said.
"Yay!" Boo screamed.
"Really?" Erin asked again.
Instead of a yes, I kissed her making Boo disgusted and run away.
"I love you." She said.
"I love you too." I replied.
"I have to take shower and I want to go out and get some stuff afterwards, can you watch Boo?" She asked.
"Sure, no problem." I said.
"Thanks. Thank you, Jordan." She said before kissing me. I sat in the living room in case Boo needed anything, but no, not untill after Erin left.
"Jordan?" Boo said sweetly.
"Yeah?" I asked.
