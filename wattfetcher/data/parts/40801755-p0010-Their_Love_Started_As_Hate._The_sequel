"Your crazy," he said after telling him the whole story of us breaking up the school fire, I wouldn't be surprised if his face stood like this the whole day, I laughed at my thoughts and he turned to look at me,
The bus came to a stop so we all turned to see if we where at the hotel, "yes we're here," I fist pumped the air with a giggle, and we both jumped up of the seat, "I can't wait to go to Barry's and the beach," "the beach, on February, brad get your head out of your arse,"
"Hey, you gotta love the beach," he smiled, "you are a bigger ass than Mark," I laughed and so did he, "well that's not what you where saying last night in our bedroom," we both froze and i looked at brad, our eyes where both wide, i turned on my heels "what are you doing here," "I could ask you the same question," he smirked.
