I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But your perfect me.
I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
Because it's you! Oh it's you!
It's you! They add up to
And i'm in love with you and
All these little things.
