I just want to let you know that this was inspired by the Quarantined series :) though Sam and David are most definitely not gay for each other. And this is going to be NOTHING like the quarantined series. I just kinda copied three names, and certain events from the book(s).
Also, WARNINGS:
1) This book will contain swear words, since it is: 1) (on average) normal for teenage males to swear, and 2) I tend to swear a lot as well, so.
2) This book will contain explicit (sexual) scenes, and if you're too young (I was probably eleven when I first read smut O.O) or aren't comfortable with it, then I'm sorry. This isn't the book for you :/
3) If you haven't noticed yet, this book will contain gay shit (not literal  speaking). If you don't agree with homosexual ways or are uncomfortable with it, then again, I am sorry, but this is not the book for you.
If you are for whatever reason(s) okay with all of these, then please! Give my book a try!
Whelp....
Hope you enjoy the story!
Side note: This is my second attempt at writing a boyxboy story that doesn't have any correlation with one direction what so ever. I deleted the other one because I wasn't feeling it, but I hate deleting stories so for this story I will NOT GIVE UP.
