"Well that's reassuring. Minor technical problem indeed! Why can't they just say it broke down?" Phil muttered.  "Anyway, what were you saying, Dan?"
"I was going to ask, why is that girl staring at us?" he replied, pointing to the glass panel in the door at the end of the carriage. "She's really creeping me out."
Phil leaned across Dan to get a better look at the spot Dan was pointing at.
"There's no-one there, Dan."
"Yes there is, a little girl, about ten years old, wearing a Victorian maid's costume, staring right at us," Dan insisted, pointing straight at the door.
"Dan, there's nothing there."
Dan got up and strode the length of the aisle. He couldn't understand why Phil was denying her existence. He would just go and talk to the girl and ask her to stop staring. When he reached the intersection, however, he found it completely empty. Where had the girl gone? They were in the end carriage, and he definitely hadn't passed her in the aisle, and yet she had completely vanished. Slightly unnerved, he returned to his seat.
"Are you alright Dan? You look very pale," Phil asked as he sat down. Concern was written all over Phil's face.
"I'm fine," Dan replied. He must have imagined the girl. He tried to put the image of the child out of his mind as he slid his headphones back on and leaned back into his chair for the remainder of the journey.
