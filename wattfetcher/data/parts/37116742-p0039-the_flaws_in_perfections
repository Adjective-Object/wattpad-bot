There is no comfort in the truth, I should have known better, I should have changed.
Time will never mend, the careless rejections of a friend, it's easy to pretend, please stay.
So break me down if it keeps you alright, I'm the one you can always trust What a waste of my time
I'm so much more, than every lie.
Did you ever think to ask, if I'm okay?
If you want me hold me back, I don't need a friend I need to end, so far away
I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
Today's the day I'm fading away
