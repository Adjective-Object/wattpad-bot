That evening, the campfire was warm and bright. The sticks we held with meat on the ends glowed, heat running through our arms.
"Man," Teddy said, a big grin plastered on his ridiculous face. "That was the all time train dodge! Too cool." He then laughed, turning to Vern who sat down beside him. "Vern, you were so scared, you looked like that fat guy in Abbott and Costello when he saw the mummy."
The boy scowled. "I wasn't that scared."
"Vern," we chorused.
"No really," he protested. "I wasn't, sincerely."
Gordie looked smug. "Okay, then you won't mind if we check the seat of your Jockeys for Hershey squirts, will you?"
We burst into laughter.
"Hey Vern," Chris said, eyeing the boy's hamburger. "You better turn your's over."
But the stubborn boy shook his head. "No, this is the way I like it."
"Fine."
His burger suddenly plopped down into the fire. We all laughed once more as Vern complained, "Aw no man! No man! You got anymore Gordie?"
Lachance's laugh strengthened. "Sorry Vern."
"It's not funny! What am I supposed to eat?" Vern cried.
"Your feet?" I suggested, bringing back Teddy's joke, and we laughed some more.
Teddy rolled his eyes. "Why don't you cook your dick?"
"It'd be a small meal." Chris joked and that did it, we were laughing too hard and my stomach started hurting.
Vern's scowl suddenly turned to glee. "Aha! Screw you guys," he said, showing us his hamburger that was set back on his stick. "Hahaha."
