Lauren what is your opinion on this?" My dad says and my mom smirks." I don't think they should go alone I think me and Camz should go with them." She says and smirks."Ok it is Camz and I, Second oh hell no." Taylor smiles and says " I agree with Lauren." " Me too." My parents say and smile. "Ugh ok I'll tell Bae."
