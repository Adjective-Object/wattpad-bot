It's a cycle. A bloody fucking cycle.
You have emotions. Terrible, horrible emotions. Emotions that are quite literally killing you.
So what do you do?
You shut them off. You stop feeling them. You can't survive with them.
But you also can't survive without emotions either. So you do anything you can to get them back. Because feeling nothing feels the worse.
So you get them back.
And now you can't live with them. And the cycle begins anew.
