I know."Hey you guys, can I talk to Bella alone?" Asked Hayes.Oh gosh... What did he do this time..?"Sure." Cash said and they stepped outside the room. Hayes sat next to me and I poked his side because he's taking up my space. .-.He laughed and looked at me nervously.."Hayes, what's wrong?""Nothing's wrong.. I just have something really important to tell you.."Oh no.."Which is?""Bella, I really, REALLY like you. I know this isn't the BEST way to tell you but I had to tell you before I exploded. I'm sorry that this might ruin our friendship but you're just so beautiful, your personality is AMAZING, you're so kind, funny, and would never hurt a soul. I just-"I cut him off. "Hayes I really like you too.""I knew you wouldn't like me- wait seriously??""Yes, Hayes. Seriously." "OH my gosh I'm so hap- I mean, cool. That's cool."I just laughed. "Will you go on a date with me tonight, Ara? Around 7?""Of course I will, Hayes." I said smiling. "Sweet." He said and he smiled really big, which made his eyes look even more gorgeous."I'll see you then, babe." he said winking then walked out. I fell asleep. really happy.
