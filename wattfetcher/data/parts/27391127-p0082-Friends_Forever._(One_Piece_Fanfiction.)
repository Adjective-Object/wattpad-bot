The supervisors for the trip were: Boa Hancock, Shanks, Ace, Marco and Law.
"Alright now students. You should put your stuff in your rooms. The list is up there. Since there are about 30 of you, there are 5 villas. 6 in a villa however the boys cannot sleep in the same room as the girls. Do you understand-yoi?" Marco explained then asked. The students replied yes immediately and went to check the list.
"Villa 4 room 2. Interesting." Sakura noted.
"I'm the same villa too!" Aya exclaimed.
"So are us!" Robin and Namie exclaimed.
"I'm the same villa too." Haruka answered spoiling their fun.
"Zoro is in the same villa as us." Nami noted, "And the supervisor is Shanks and Ace is the vice."
"Interesting. Let's go there now. This bag is too heavy~" Aya complained.
----------------------------
"C'est belle. Cette villa est vraiment magnifique." Sakura sighed as she stepped inside the villa. The villa comprised of two floors. Upstairs for the girls and downstairs for the boys.
Upstairs, the walls were a pure white and seemed to glow in the radiant sunlight. The living room had simple but elegant decorating, simple couches around a coffee table. They were two rooms. One for Aya and Sakura which had two beds and a window facing the sea. The other, for Robin and Nami was facing the Island.
Although the boy's one was highly similar except for the fact that there was one bedroom.
"Le lit est doux~." Sakura sang rolling all over the bed.
"Its softer than the one in our dorms." Aya added, jumping on her bed.
"What are you? Children? We have to go." Nami scolded.
"Okay!" Aya and Sakura sang in unison. They sipped out of the room and the girls joined the boys who were already outside waiting for them.
"Geez, what were you doing? Shopping."
No, Mr.Baruka." Sakura teased, passing her hand through his hair, an action he did not favour.
"Getting your fucking hands out of my hair."
"Si doux~" Sakura sighed.
"Get away from me!"
Sakura eventually listen until she looked at Zoro. She just looked at him. The she started pulling his hair.
"Why does the moss feel like hair?" Sakura asked, looking at the moss he called, 'hair'.
"ITS NOT MOSS! IT'S HAIR!" Zoro screamed.
"What's all that noise for?" Shanks asked walking up to them.
"Nothing, sir." Nami said nervously.
"This resort is really amazing! Its filled with things I've never seen before!" Sakura spoke, her eyes rapidly filling up with wonder.
"Really?"
"Then I hope you enjoy this resort."
"Arigatou, Shanks-sensei."

The students were all having fun in their own ways, whilst being careful not too bring too much property damage. The trip was all expense paid since the school knew that some of the students had 'strange' habits.
