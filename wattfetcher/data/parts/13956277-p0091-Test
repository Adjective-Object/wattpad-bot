The teams were like: Me and Simon, William and Diana, Damon and Hannah , Peter and Tom were with some girls I didn't know, Connor and Miley, and Jake came with a girl, its gonna be dirty ... We were 7 couples. "You said you can't play" Damon told Simon, "You aint Leena dude!" Simon said and I chuckled, "LET'S GO".
The game started, I took the ball from Peter, gave it to Simon and he jumped high in the sky and BAMMM, two points for us, "Oh YEAH" I screamed, "Don't dream high, we gonna beat ya" Miley bumped into me, "Keep calm Leena, we got this" Simon said, we continued playing, Connor kept trying to make me trip, "Stop it Connor" Simom threatened him, "GOAL" I heard Damon and Hannah scream, "Come on! We gotta win this" I pulled simon away from Connor and we continued playing, Simon took the ball, gave it to me and "BAAAM, 3-POINTS SHOT" Simon did a little stuoid dance. The score was, Damon and Hannah: 2 points, Me and Simon : 5 points.
"Good shot" Jake said and touched my but, I did my best to control myself, Simon was surrounded by William, Diana, Peter and Tom, he threw the ball to me then ran to the baskit, I threw tha balk forcefully at Jake's face and it reflected and tumped into Simon's hands, and he scored. Jake fell and everybody burst out in laughter, "Coach! She's not allowed to do this" The girl with thin voice that came with jake said, the coach was too busy with laughing while rollin on the floor, "Wanna play dirty ha?" I raised an eyebrow at him, "Yiu broke my nose" Jake ran to the bathroom. "WE WOOOOON ! HUG ME GURL" Simom ran toward me with hid arms wide open, "No way man ! I didn't touch you when you were clean, I aint gonna hug you when you're sweaty and stinky" I said and everybody laughed. "You were good" Simom said as we were walking to the changing rooms, I was about to say something but I tripped and fell, by Connors leg, I stood up and looked hum right in the eye, "AAAH" I punched his face with my clenched fist, his head slammed the wall, "I was about to do the same" Simon said, "Thank you, I can take care of my self, I removed the imaginary dust of my shoulders and fixed my hijab then left.
