Erin's POV
My breathing was really heavy and I wasn't sure if I could say anything anymore.
"Ohh, Erin. Breathe, stop crying it's fine, you're fine" He said as a tear fell from his cheek onto the back of my hand.
"Oh, Jor -- Jordan." I said.
Trying to calm myself down made me even more upset.
Jordan held me in his arms for almost an hour as we both cried, him crying over me, and me crying over the fact everyone knew we were together.
"You got me crying, now were both upset and that's not fun." He said.
"I ca -- can't sto -- stop cryi -- ing!" I screamed into his shoulder as we walked inside.
"You've never cried this much, at least not in front of me. I wish you could just be able to stop crying when you wanted to." He said adorably.
"Well, it -- it doesn't hel -- help that I'm on my p -- period I gue -- guess." I chuckled while trying to calm myself down. I finally stopped crying for the most part, and then I sobbed into Jordan again right after.
"Erin, it's gonna work out, people will know and then if we slip up it won't matter, right?" He said before wiping a tear from his face and taking a deep breath.
"I don't -- no it wont!" I said as he tried to kiss me. "Jordan, please!" I said while standing up and leaning on the wall.
"What? I can't kiss you? I love you, and you love me, right? Please say yes. Right?" He asked. He noticed my hand was shaking and he grabbed it to try and make it stop but it only made his hand shake too.
"Yes, Jordan! Of course I love you, I just can't -- I don't know what I can't, I won't -- I don't even care anym -- " I said just before we kissed eachother.
"Yes! Just don't cry anymore, please?" He asked.
"Oh, Jordan." I said quietly as he ran his fingers through my hair and looked in my bloodshot eyes.
"Jesus." He said shaking his head and laughing.
"What?" I asked while sniffling.
"We just cried for an hour, Erin." He said. He hugged me, rested his chin on my head and kissed it.
"I love you, Jordan." I said.
"I love you, Erin." He said.
