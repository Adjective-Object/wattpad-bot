Erin's POV
WHY DID I KISS HIM?
"Jordan!" I screamed as he ran to the bathroom.
what would I do that for? I didn't know I did that or was going to till I was up in his face and had my lips on his... his soft kissable cute pink - OH MY GOD! I'm falling for Jordan.
Jordan's POV
She kissed me. my heart dropped and she screamed my name as I ran to the bathroom to think before doing something I might regret. "Erin? come here." I said through the closed locked door as I leaned on the sink.
"What?" she asked while trying turn the knob of the locked door.
"What did we just do? did I do that or did you do that?" I asked while I looked in the mirror rethinking the way I should live "I did that." she said before asking herself why she did in a whisper in hopes that I wouldn't hear her.
