Heh, scared 'em.
"Am I seriously a reincarnation?"
They glanced at each other, then back at me.
"Yes, (F/N). That's why you run into demons, angels, and reapers so often."
"Reapers?"
"Grell was one."

"We can't."
I rolled my eyes. "Then how are you so sure?"
No answer.
"Fine then..."
I walked out of the room feeling slightly betrayed.
Damn that demon.
