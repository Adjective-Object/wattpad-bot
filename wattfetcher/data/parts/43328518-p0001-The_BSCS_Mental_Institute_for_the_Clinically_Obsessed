Once you enter The BSCS Mental Institute, there's no coming back. You're in for life. And I was in now. My name was Ross, but when you're new they give you a new one, just in case you don't want the other inmates to know who you are. So my name round here is Kristoff, and at the beginning, that's all anyone ever called me. Let's start at the beginning.
My first day. I had always loved Disney, but it was becoming an obsession now. My girlfriend had decided that I needed to be with people like me, so she shipped me of to BSCS. When I arrived, I was met at the door by someone called Big Six Comic Strip. She told me that she was the founder of the institute, and she was the one who kept everything together. I quickly found out her real name was Lexi, and that she belonged in the institute just as much as we did.She took me to a room with a few other people. We were introduced to each other, only by our new names in the beginning. Anna, Elsa, Astrid, Merida, Pitch Black, Kiara, Rapunzel, Hiccup, Jack Frost and Eugene. There were ten of us, not including Lexi. It was fun, but we didn't know each other at all, and we didn't talk often, but it was enough, and after a few days, we all became very close. Lexi wrote our story, and we lived it, within the institute. Over time, people started to reveal their real names. Eugene became Brandon, Astrid became Scorps, Merida was Hannah, and so on. Almost too many to remember. We all knew each other, then more people started to join.
