-We talked yesterday Brett, I have a problem
-Yeah? I'm kinda busy with my other patient's problems right now- come back another time
-Brett I'm serious- look I don't know how I'm gonna afford my apartment, I barely managed last year.
I hear him sigh and I know the answer
-Look Lil, I'm sorry. I can't afford to give you any more money, I need to save up for school.
Unlike me, Brett couldn't earn a scholarship and he's trying to earn his masters.
-I guess your tutoring isn't exactly paying the bills.
-Nope not at the moment.
We stay silent for a few minutes brainstorming
-Hey! I got it- why don't you rent out half of your apartment
-What?
-You know like get a roommate, someone who could pay half of the rent for you.
-But I can barely fit into my apartment!!
-Lil if your having trouble with money your going to have to sacrifice certain luxuries
-Look I have to go- sleep on it, it actually could be fun
Before I could protest he hung up.
Love you too Brett
What was he thinking- a roommate.
Seriously.
You'd think my brother would give better advise. I think I give him more credit than he deserves.
I take a good look around my cramped apartment. I wouldn't call it luxurious, more like cozy. They would have to sleep on the pull out couch and share a bathroom with me.
Let's just say I'm not exactly the easiest person to live with- I've heard that multiple times from Brett.
I sit cross legged on my bed sipping my lukewarm coffee. A roommate would be a major change in my life.
But change is good isn't it?
It better be because change is unfortunately the only option.

Thank you so much to anyone who reads my story.
Just to let you know this is my first fanfiction.
I'll try to update at least every week because I have sports.
I am a huge fan of the boys and I guess with ZAYN leaving and all I've been more involved.
I made some fan accounts on Instagram with my friends so why not a fanfiction?

Oh yeah I'm super bad at being creative when it comes to names, hence the characters name.
