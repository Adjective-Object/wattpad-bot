Kei's POV
It was 7:00am in the morning and I had to get ready for my practices.
When I was done preparing I took out my phone while I moved out the room.
While I was scrolling things on my phone, my eyes widen when I saw......
.....
....
....
"V!!!!!"I said as I ran downstairs.
Once I got to the living room, V was just chilling out with the TV.
He noticed I was there but completely ignored me.
"Yah! V, What is this?!"I said as I showed him my phone.
He lazily looked at my phone and then looked at me.
"So, What? I'm dating Sujeong..."He said and continued watching the TV.
"V you didn't even tell me you we're dating her!"I pouted.
"Do I have too even?"He boringly said.
*Sighs* "Make sure to take care of sujeong!"I commanded him, because me and sujeong are bestfriends.
He didn't seem to listen so I standed infront of him.
"Yah! Your blocking the way!"He glared.
"Promise me first you'll take care of sujeong!"I said as I held out my pinky.
He ruffled his hair then took my pinky.
I smiled then said."Congrats!"I happily said in Joy.
I was about to leave but at the corner of my eye, V bit his lip.
"You don't care don't you."He said out of a sudden.
"Huh? What do you mean, of course I care, your my brother right?"I smiled.
"Oh! Look at the time, I have to get going!"I said as I gave a fast kiss on V's Forehead.

"Ok! That's about it!"Our dance choreographer said.
When Our choreographer left, I drank a bottle of water then went near Sujeong.
"Sujeong."I called out.
She turned around and smiled.
"Oh! Unnie."Sujeong said as she hugged me.
"I heard your dating V."I smiled.
She happily smiled. "Yeah, we are!"
I was talking to sujeong about she should becareful of V because he has a big temper and stuff.
But out of no where a guy grabbed my hand, pulling me out of the room.
"Kei!"Sujeong and the others shouted in shock.
"Ah!!!"I shouted.
I couldn't see the guy who grabbed me because he placed a mask on.
"Who are you?!"I nervously said.
The guy stopped and turned around with a smirked.
"You don't remember me?"He said while taking out his mask.
............
"Jimin?!"I looked shocked.
"Shouldn't you be happy?"He asked.
