Tell your story with the eloquence of poetry,
Make your life be a work of art.
Never stop chasing the stars,
I promise one day it'll pay off.
Do something with your life.
Life is a beautiful gift,
Blossoming with philosophy,
People, cultures, dreams,
Words, books, poetry,
Nature. Life is full to its
Brim with life.
Everything is alive with energy,
From the stars lighting up the midnight
Sky to the sea creatures at the bottom of the ocean.
You have a choice to look at life in one of two ways;
You can recognize the beauty of life
Or you can be blinded by the lies of society
And believe that life is about being at a "higher rank"
Than everyone- everything else.
And let me tell you, I've never met someone
Who chose the first option and hated it.
We are all people, and as much as you try
To deny it, we are just people.
I think that we should treat the world-
Not just the people- equally. The sun,
The grass, the trees, the animals
Are just as much a part of our world
As we are.
Life is beautiful.
Recognize that.
Life is art.
