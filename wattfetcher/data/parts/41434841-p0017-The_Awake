Idk. I made a 94 on my biology exam. I could've done better. All of this sucks. I'm out of cigarettes. I have no blades, lighters, or anything that I could use to harm myself. I don't know what to do. I kinda feel like shit. Dysphoria is hell. Either way I'm awake. I don't like it as much as I did when it first happened but at least I'm here.
