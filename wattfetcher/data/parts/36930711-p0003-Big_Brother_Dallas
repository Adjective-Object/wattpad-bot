ARABELLA'S POV
When we got to his house i stared in awe. "this.. This is your house?" i asked a little surprised. "our house." he said, smiling.I just kept staring at it while slowly walking towards the front door. "i will take you to your room" cam said and i just followed him. We went up two flights of stairs and we stopped infront of a white door. We entered the room and i stood there. It was amazing!I absolutely loved it.
I turned towards cam and hugged him saying,"thank you thank you thank you!" He said "you're welcome. Dinner will be ready soon!"That's good cause I was STARVING. I set my bag of not a lot things on the bed to start putting my few clothes items in the dressers and closet when they were both filled with clothes and shoes. I stared in awe. "Dinners ready!" Shouted cam. "Okay I'll be down in a few!" I yelled back. *after dinner*"That was amazing! Thank you cam!" I said and hugged him."Cam! I forgot to do something at the orphanage. Can you pretty please drive me there??" I asked with pleading eyes. "Sure!" He said with a smile.
Once we got there I told cam to video tape this. I went inside and yelled, "hey Stacy where are you!?!!"And she looked at me with disgust. "What do you want you slut?" She asks. "Can you do me a favor and tell the Devil I said hi when you go to hell? Thanks!" I said/shouted and walked out. While I was walking out I flipped her off and told cam to stop recording. "That. Was. Awesome!" He said and high-fived me. We both laughed and drove home. "So can I ask you why you own this expensive car?" I asked and he said,"well. My friends and I are kind of famous on... Let's say.... The Internet." I stared at him. "Awesome!" I yelled maybe a little too loud?
