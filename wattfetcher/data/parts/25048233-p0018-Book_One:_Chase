“Mel, who’s that guy? He looks familiar.” I asked while looking at the guy petting our dogs through the windows.
“That’s your boyfriend. I told you!”
Sigh. I opened the door fully to see who the mysterious guest was. To my dismay, it was freaking Ice. I faced Mel with a questioning look.
“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Mel! Why is that person here?!”
“I told you! He’s your boy - Oh… right.”
“What?” I got confused with the sudden change of Mel’s tone. “Am I missing something? Is there something you’re hiding from me?”
Mel looked as if being questioned in the court or something. “I-I… Ah! He said he-he w-was your… right! He said he was your bestfriend. That’s why I let him enter. You happy now?”
“What?! You can’t be serious Mel. You’re saying you let him enter because he told you he’s my bestfriend? What if he’s a murderer? We could’ve been chopped meat right now!”
“I-I’m sorry! But I’m pretty sure h-he’s not!”
“How can you be so sure? You haven’t even met him yet! He’s basically a stranger to you.”
“But y-you… you do know him, do you?”
“Yes. But that’s not the point Mel!” I’m not really sure if I’m mad because he let strangers enter our house easily or because he let Ice inside.
“I’m sure he has good intentions! I just know.”
“I’m telling you this again – you can’t be so sure all the freaking time! You’re acting as if you know him already.” There’s something suspicious going on here. I can smell it. “And besides, why are the dogs not barking as usual? It’s as if this guy has been living with us every day.”
“B-because… I ordered them to!”
“What a lame excuse…”
“Oh Chase. You’re here!”
“…” I got startled by Ice’s voice that I wasn’t able to say anything.
“Have you already taken your breakfast? Mel told me you like bacon so I cooked them for you.”
“N-no. I don’t eat bacon. I hate bacon. Mel, I’m eating fastfood. Tell Ma, I’m gonna’ be out for some time.” I lied. I really really love bacon!
“Wait wait!” Ice tried to stop me.
“What? I mean… Thanks for preparing food for me. But I, I don’t eat bacon. Sorry.”
He started chuckling. This guy really thinks everythings funny eh?
“What? Wh-what’s funny?”
“Nothing. Hehe.” He still continued laughing.
“WHAT?! Just tell me already!”
“Hahaha. I just find it funny that you’re going outside with only your sando and boxers on. Haha.” He looked downwards and laughed again.
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I’m still in my freaking boxer shorts! I hurriedly covered my “thing” with my hands and hurriedly went upstairs to change. Damn this Ice! But yeah, he’s right. Who goes outside with only boxers on? Pervs?
