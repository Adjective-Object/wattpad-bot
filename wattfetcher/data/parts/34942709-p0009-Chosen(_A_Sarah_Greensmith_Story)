Sarah's POVIn the morning,I got to sleep in,because it was a Friday. No classes,and three days I get to enjoy. Except I have training,and Ren won't stop yelling.I got ready, putting Pip on a leash and putting Ren in his sheath, and headed down today the gym.When I got in there Logan wasn't there,so I decided to use the practice dummy. About 10 minutes later Logan came in,looking exhausted and not his normal person."What's wrong?" I asked, not sure what I was supposed to do."Oh, nothing that concerns you." He said grimacing at me."Whatever, no reason to get your panties in a wad." I said"Well there's no reason for your head to be up your ass, because there's a world around you." Logan said angrily, really making me ticked."Really, my heads not in my ass, I see the world as it is every day." I said, swinging my fist at him, hitting his jaw. I have to say, we were both surprised.    Logan stared, his hand on his jaw, and I was holding my hand against my chest, it really hurt. Logan's anger went away, and he pulled me into a hug, and man I was so surprised. Logan apparently was to because he pulled back, and tried to shrug it off.  "Nice hit." He said, then cleared his throat."Thanks, I think," I said, looking at him funny," it hurt, what's your face made off, steel."   "No,but people usually don't get a hit on me." Logan said,smiling."Sorry you were being an ass, you deserved it." I said, and I heard Ren agree.  "Yeah, well I'm trying to do my best to get back to my old self," Logan gave me wink," the one who was a bully and wanted to get in your pants."  I shook my head, laughing. I knew then there that Logan and I were going to be more than friends.
