"Here we are" Damon stopped in front of the orphanage, we got out of the car holding tens of plastic bags amd Elina rang the bell, the door opened slowly and a scary woman appeared, I'm not the kind of people who judge people by their appearance but ... She looked like one of those witches in movies, about 40 years old, thin, angry, hands crossed over chest, tons of makeup, plucked eyebrows.
"What ?" She frowned when she saw us, "Uh umm we actually came to uhh" Even Damon looked scared and couldn't talk properly, "We bought some things for the girls" I gave her the fakest smile I could draw on my face, "Hmmm, let me see" She snapped two plastic baga from my hamd and scanned carefully, "Hmm, you can leave these things here" She turned a sigar on, "I'm sorry, but are you allowed to smoke ? Since it's bad for the girls especially the little ones", "I'm sorry, but its none of your buiseness, now hand me those things because I should get back inside and lock the door before it's 12", "I'm sorro but either we get in, see the girls, hand then what we beought, or we'll go back home with all these expensive things back, plus, I have a crystan bracelet you might like" And here goes one of ny best fake smiles, "Get in" She opened the door widely for us and guided us in, "GIRLS COME DOWN YOU HAVE SOME VISITORS AND GIFTS" Only three seconds passed before we heard fast footsteps running down the stairs and stopped in front of us, I saw girls aged from 3-17 , "Hi, My name is Leena and these two are Elina and Damon, I know it's late but we got some things to give you" Then, the cutest little girl I've ever seen grabbed my leg "Did you get me anything ?" She looked at me with those big innocent beautiful pair of eyes, I carried her and smiled widely, "Of course I did but ... ", " But what ?" She frowned, "I should know your name first and get a big kiss on my cheek from you", "I'll give you the biggest kiss if you want me to" Damon winked at me, the little girl chuckled "Ignore him, he's so annoying, now tell me your name", " My name is Nina" She squeezed my head and kissed my cheek with all the force the had, I laughed " Well Nina, from now on you're going to be my little friend, Okay ? Now go to Uncle Damon to take your gift" I put her down and she ran and grabbed Damon's leg, "Hi uncle Damon" she poked his leg three times until he noticed her, "Hey sweety" Damon carried her and threw her in the air three times, Nina laughed out loud "Now here is your gift" I stared at Damon while he was playing with the little girls and laughing, I never thought that Damon had a soft spot for little kids neither a kind sweet soft side, our gazes met more than once but I was too busy looking at a Damon I've never seen before neither imagined, little girls were jumping on him and hugging him, he was laughing uncontrollably "Heeeeelp" He screamed but he was cut off by a little girl with fizzy hair shutting his mouth and another girl closing his eyes.
Me and Elina took the clothes and gave them to the older girls, they were so sweet and thankful, but then my eyes lied on three girls sitting in the corner and eying me, I smiled at them and held some blouses and perfumes then walked to them, "Hey, I guess these will look great on you",Â  "We don't need anything from you, especially pitty" One of them said, "Excuse me ?" I felt offended, "We know what you're after, stay away from us and especially Nina, she's still young, we know people like you", "Leena, we have to go" Damon tapped my shoulder and I pushed his hand away, "I'm coming" Damon said goodbye to the little girls and winked at the big ones, you know damon ...
"I still believe that these will look good on you" I gave them the blouses then put my shoese on, I heard somebody clear his throat so I turned my face and saw the woman who's responsible for the girls "Here's your bracelet" I gave her what I promised her with and her face lightened up, looks like she only smiles at money.
"Leena" Nina ran toward me and hugged me, "Please come tomorrow", I looked at her older sister who gave me a deadly glare, "I'll try my best, now give me a goodbye kiss".
