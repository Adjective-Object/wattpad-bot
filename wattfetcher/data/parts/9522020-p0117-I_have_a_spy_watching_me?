"You haven't seen him that long?  I thought you saw him for four whole months after that?"
"I did, but I haven't seen him since the last time I drank which was the stop of the four months and I never drank after that.  I don't drink anymore nor will I drink underage from that moment on."
"You know, getting to know you is getting stranger and stranger yet, I think I am not disliking it."  Chase said just before his phone rang.  "Hello?  Do I have to?  Ughh, I am kind of busy sir...  No, no okay, I get it.  I'll be there soon."
He hung up and looked at me with an apologetic face.
"It's fine.  Just go."  I said encouragingly.
"Alright, bye Jaycie."  He said kissing my cheek.  "Oh, and I want to know who you dated before me, because we all believe I am your first or second boyfriend."
"I'll tell you my ex's if you tell me yours!"  I yelled after him and I heard him laugh out an ok.
"You had ex's?"  Talon said.
That's when I knew I should probably explain to them later.
