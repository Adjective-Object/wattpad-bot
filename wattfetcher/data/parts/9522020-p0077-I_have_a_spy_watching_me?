"You showed him your back?"  Skull asked and we both nodded.
I brought her chair closer to me even though she was sitting next to me already.  I put my arm around her and she cuddled close to me.
"Yeah.  Some were recent wounds some weren't, but that was mainly.."
"Don't continue and tell me the rest of what happened!  Did you two do anything else?"  She asked as if knowing we did.
"Come on Chase.  You and I know you just can't keep your hands off of her."  Skull said giving me a smirk.
I glared at him as I was turning a bit redder.
"Knock it off Skull."  Tania said while laughing.
"You want to know then?  I kissed Jaycie."  I said looking at her red face and she laughed.
"Yeah."  She said biting her lip.
"AWEEEEEE!!!!  That's cute!  You two should be a couple!"  Tania said.
"I'd agree, but Jaycie can do so much better than Chase."  We heard an over exaggerate voice say and I knew it was Clara.
"Oh come on, Clara.  I am not that bad.  If anything I am better than Skull."  I said.
"Puh-lease in another universe."  Skull said.
"No in this universe, because this is my universe."  I said with a smirk.
The girls started to laugh as Clara put our appetizers on the table along with a few plates.
__________________________
*Jaycie's POV*
The date was great!  I guess things did get better.  Apparently Chase and Skull wanted to take us some where else.  When I noticed that it was the forest I was a bit hesitant, but I went anyway.  We were laying close by each other and looked at stars.  Soon we separated when we started to walk.  Jaycie said that Chase was taking me the other way to the cabin that we were all going to stay in.  They apparently got permission to let us stay in the cabin for the night.
As we were walking he stopped us as the cabin came into view.
"What's wrong, Chase?"  I asked.
He smiled and brought me close to him.
"Nothing.  I just wanted to hold you and I couldn't wait."  He said making me blush.
"Oh."  I say while smiling.
I looked up a bit shyly and he moved my curls back.  Touching my cheek he smiled.
"You alright?"  He asked only he was smirking as I was fidgeting.
"I'm fine."  I said with the blush ever so present on my face.
He got near my ear and whispered.
"You really are."
I shivered from his warm breathe hitting my neck.  I saw him smile.  I pouted and whacked his arm softly.
"Stop it."  I pouted and he laughed.
"Okay, okay."  He said.  "Lets go."
He held onto my hand and brought me to the cabin.  We entered and what we saw made me laugh.  Tania and Skull were kissing and I couldn't help it I just burst out laughing.
"You guys couldn't even wait until you got to your room?"  Chase asked chuckling at them.
