You could say
That I write.
And that would be true.
But the minute you say
That I write too much
Is when it becomes a lie.
For there is no such thing
As writing too much.
The same way you breathe
All the time, constantly,
I am always writing.
The most beautiful thing
Is to see the way
These words roll off your tongue.
The way the words come out
Too fast but it's never imperfect.
Write about the way
You feel the air on your skin.
Write about everything.
For there is no such thing
As writing too much.
