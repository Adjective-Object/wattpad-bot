Hi, My name is Rae Lyric Morgan, I am 22 years of age and I live in Katoomba, NSW, Australia. I have plans to move to Ireland, Japan or Korea, but nothing definite. I shall tell you a bit about myself: My favourite bands are EXO and All Time Low, I love pavlova, I have a gigantic sweet tooth but still eat healthily and I'm pretty sure if we all ate like L from Death Note or Honey Senpai from Ouran HSHC We would get lots of cavities. Anyways I aspire to be an author, and have an obsession with books.I'm very sarcastic, so don't mess with me or I will...sarcasm you to death, so yeah. BOOM! And family and friends come first no matter what.
Appearance: Black hair, big grey eyes, pale but a little tanned, scar on her left cheek from dog attack, medium full eyebrows, plump heart shaped lips, round face etc.
~Author's note~Hi people of the interwebs, sorry I haven't updated in a while been kind of busy with exams and stuff. I hope this is alright, like I said I'm not good with punctuation but I'm working on it and the first chapter will be up soon! :)
