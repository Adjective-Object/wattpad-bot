They told me you were nothing but trouble.
Yet I couldn't resist- not when you sat
In your little corner of darkness and I knew that you and I
Could be like fireworks.
Your pale fingertips traced paths of magic across my body,
As you were tangled in the light soaked sheets.
I loved you.
I loved you so bad it killed me, and
Without me
There is no us.
I suppose you realized I was destined for a path of sadness.
It's the truth.
I just hoped that somebody would see me as something worthwhile.
Yet I was stupid enough to believe you would.
I was as dark as night
And you loved the daylight.
