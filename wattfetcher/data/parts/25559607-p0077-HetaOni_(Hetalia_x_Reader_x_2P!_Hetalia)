"Oh!! Germa--" I tried to call out to stop him, but he was already out of earshot.
(There's no time left. I can't call out to him, nor can I physically stop him. I'm sure our enemy is stronger, too.)
(... Hm?)
(Wait a minute. Our enemy is definitely stronger. Whenever I glimpsed a memory,its strength and speed had increased greatly.)
(But it wasn't... just the enemy...)
"Aaargh!!" We heard Germany shout.
Italy's face suddenly turned pale. He quickly dashed to where his friend was. "Germany!! What happened? Did you fall over?"
"Let's go." Prussia said as he motioned me to follow them.
(Maybe what Prussia was trying to say is that?)
Germany's Torture level went up.Italy learned a new skill.Prussia learned a new skill.Japan learned a new skill.
"D-Did I just see something flash in front of me just now?" I suddenly said out loud.

When we got there, the grey monster stood in front of the now-burnt ladder.
"...There it is." I managed to say.

Italy looked at us and spoke, "All together! That's it! If we run, we can still make it!!"
Germany nodded. "Y-yes."
(Our enemy may be tough, but I'm still faster. I can't do this alone. However...)
"Japan!!" Prussia called after me.
(Now...)
We all ran towards the door.
"Prussia! Wait! Germany tripped over a rock!" I yelled.

"Shit! Not in this place--Go!! I can't get this vine off!!" Germany shouted at us.
"...Hh! Germany!" Italy cried.
Prussia looked back at me. "Japan!! Have you got your answer yet?!"
