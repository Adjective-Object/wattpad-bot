My gaze tore away from my book and I looked over at the McKinnon's. I wondered what Jack was thinking about or if he's thinking about me at all. But the sight of white hair in Jack's room made my breath hitch in my throat. Paxton stood in Jack's room and Jack stood in front of him. Paxton stood firm with his arms crossed against his chest while Jack spoke. Jack was livid while Paxton remained calm.
I closed my curtains and got into bed, ready to fall asleep. It was barely ten minutes when my phone rang on my bedside table. I leaned over the other side of my bed, looking down at the lit up screen.
Jack's name flashed across the screen for only a few seconds before my phone went dim.
My phone vibrated again, Jack's name displayed on the screen.
I hesitated, but answered it this time.

You guys are the best! :)
Song: Wildest Dreams by Taylor Swift (I can't link it because it's not on youtube, but listen to the cover by  Madilyn Bailey, because it's absolutely beautiful.) But if you have it on your phone, that's great. :)
