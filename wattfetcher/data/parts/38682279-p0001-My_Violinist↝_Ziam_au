Zayn Malik.
The name everyone knows around school, he's pretty much known as the classical freak.
Why?
Well he's a prodigy, ever since he picked up the violin at the age of 5, he's been a pro at it. Zayn was pretty much the dork too, y'know the shy guy, with glasses, big sweaters over his small frame, straight A's etc. Zayn isn't really normal, then again his side kick Harry Styles isn't either, but both boys try to take on junior year trying to be punching bag free.
Liam Payne.
Now he was a different story. He's known as the badass guy you don't wanna mess with. He's pretty nice to everyone, sometimes. He hated when people throw themselves at him, he thinks it's majorly pathetic but he noticed someone who hasn't. The fair skinned boy with the old violin.
Liam decided that he wants, no he needs Zayn. He wants to know more about this quiet musician.
Maybe Zayn will break out of his shell and let himself get to know Liam, maybe he could help him learn new things, would his strict father approve of this relationship though? Will he think the badboy is interfering with his perfect prodigy son?
