"Was that too much? Are you alright?" I didn't answer him and tugged on Robert's pants. He bent down next to me and looked at me.
"Are you okay, what's wrong?" They asked as if I was just scared from the acting. Little did they know it was much, much more.
"My leg," I barely whispered.
"Your what?"
"My leg!" My voice cracked and the tears fell even faster. I looked at my leg to see blood pouring out of it and pooling around.
"Oh my God..." Tom started.
"Medic! We need a medic!" Robert screamed. All attention was turned to me as a medic rushed over. She came over and asked me what was wrong.
"My leg." She turned her focus to my leg and immediately wrapped it up.
"We need to take you to the hospital, you need stitches." No shit, Sherlock.
I was carried over to the ambulance that had arrived moments before. They laid me on a stretcher and tried to stop the bleeding from my leg. I felt it getting harder to breathe and I started to hyperventilate. The last thing I remember was a breathing mask being put on me before I passed out.
Okay so my one story is finished and my other one is almost done. Since this story will be the only one I have going, I'm thinking of publishing a new one. It won't have a story line or anything. I was thinking of doing a get to know the author type of book. It would give me more to write and for you guys to get to know me. If you want this to happen, please comment some questions who have about me. They can be about my favourite things or my opinions on topics. So let me know if you would like to have this happen and give me some questions. I'll write it if I get 10 questions, so just let me know.
There's something really, really important in this chapter. Do you know what it is?
This is one of my favourite chapters and is something I've had planned for a long time now. Like since I started this story almost a year ago. And I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I will see you next week :)
