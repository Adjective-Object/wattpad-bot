-Flashback 10 Years Old-
I woke up to being slapped in the face by my so called mother.
"Wake up slut." My mother growls
"Oh shut the hell up." I reply to her.
"Alright I had enough. Why don't you shut the hell up and go get a damn life instead of being such a female dog." She snaps.
I instantly regretted saying it. I just had to open my big mouth.
"HENRY!!!!" In came a grumpy old man that's suppose to be my father.
"What?" He says angrily obviously not wanting to be annoyed.
All I heard was my mom tell him what I said then before I knew it my 'dad' was on top of me. I struggled to get out of his tight grasp as he beat me in my already injured areas.
"HELP!!!!!" I shouted hoping one of the neighbors would hear me and call the police.
Then my father slapped me leaving a stinging feeling on my face as a tear fell down my face. Then he climbed off of me and my 'mother' handed him something and he was back on top of me. Then before I knew it a knife was being jammed into my leg causing me to let out a piercing scream. Then after about 2 minutes a world of black consumed me and that was all I remembered.
