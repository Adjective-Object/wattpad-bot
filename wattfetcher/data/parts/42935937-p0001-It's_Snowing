I was relaxing by the side of the pool after swimming with my best friend Melissa . It was the last week of school and our whole grade had gone down to the pool. I heard a pricing screech from beside me after Melissa had just come back from the concession stand. "OMG OMG OMG!!! May I am dieing!!!" Screeched Melissa. " Quentin just asked me out!!!!" "What!!! Omg tell me everything!!!" I responded. While we relaxed in the sun Melissa told me all about how Quentin came up to her in the water and they started talking and swimming around and he said that he had a crush on Melissa since grade 3 and he asked her out!!!! "Omg that's so perfect!" I yelled after Melissa finished "when are you going out??" I said as I noticed people had started staring at us but I didn't care! My best friend had just got a date with her biggest crush of all time!! As our class was leaving I noticed Quentin and Melissa exchange looks and Quentin even winked at Melissa!
