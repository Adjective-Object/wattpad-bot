Meet Sky Dalton. She's got brown hair, blue eyes, bit tanned, quite tall, and she has a perfect body. She grew up in a little wooden house in the forest with her step-dad, Keith, who raised her up  because her parents died when she was a baby. Sky isn't so innocent as people think she is. She owed everything to Keith as he looked after her, so when she found out he had an enemy, she would stop at nothing till that guy was no longer breathing.
What will happen when Sky finds out where Keith's enemy lives and moves into the city?
Sometimes things are not what they seem to be..
Keep reading to find out :)
