"Well, then, I'll go back for now. It seems I have to attend to something. If anything comes up, call me." Austria told them over the phone before ending the call.


Prussia nodded and spoke, "Okay. Be careful."


"Well, now... er, well... Where should I start? What do you want to hear?" Italy asked nervously after placing his phone back in his pocket.


Japan cupped his chin and thought for a moment, "Well, um


... this isn't the first time we...came here, is it?"


"Ah, I was also wondering about that. America said that we've gone through this several times..." Russia said, raising an eyebrow.


Italy nodded. "......Yeah. We've gone through this several times, ever since we came here from the world meeting."


America's eyes widened as his theory was confirmed. "I knew it...


... So, what happened the very first time?"


"How this started. Okay." Italy took a deep breath before continuing,


"Before the world meeting, I sneaked away from Germany's training and arrived at an unknown city somewhere.


When I was there, I happened to hear rumours about this place. I thought it sounded interesting, and I told America about it."


"Yeah, no difference so far." America said, nodding.


Italy looked over to the others, "Yeah. Oh, but


... the very first time, I came here with nine of you."


"Which is everyone except me and Spain. This really is the first time we both are here." Romano told them.


(Name) slowly raised her hand and spoke softly, "And me. This is the first time I've been in this mansion, too."
