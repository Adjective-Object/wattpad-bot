Roc won't talk to me or at least he won't answer my calls he's been on his instagram and stuff but he just ignores me I don't know what I did wrong but I'm sad and freaking out
Next day
So I stoped trying to call and text him I feel so sad but I'm a go to the 99cent store
So I'm at the 99cent store and I look really sad like I've been crying atlest that's what my friend told me but the worst thing happened while I was walking out I see him and his other friends and his little hoe right in front of me and they just stop and stare so I just push through them roc looked a little bit sad but I didn't care if he wants to ignore me he can but just a I was getting in my car he came towards me and called my name I really don't want him to see me like this but whatever
Roc: melody
Melody:what
Roc:listen I know you like me more than a friend and I know that ignoring you wasn't the best but I don't feel the same way about you and (gets cut off )
Melody:just leave me alone have a good life cuz I don't wanna be friends bye roc
