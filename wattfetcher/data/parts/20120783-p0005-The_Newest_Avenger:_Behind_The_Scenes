My mom and I landed in New York a day before the read through. I wanted to make sure I didn't have jet lag when I had to act in front of professionals. The main reason though was that I wanted to do some sightseeing.

"So, what do you think?" The hotel manager asked us.
"It's beautiful" my mom and I both replied.
The room really was gorgeous and the view showed all of New York's finest. The next couple of days were going to be amazing.

My mom and I unpacked as quickly as possible and were both exhausted afterwards. We were about to head out the door to do some sightseeing when I got a skype call. I didn't recognize the caller, but I answered it anyway. When the picture loaded, Robert Downey Jr. was on my computer screen.
"Hello" I answered.
"Oh thank God"
"I'm sorry, did I miss something?"
"Sorry about that. Joss never told me who he casted as Summer and made me skype them to see who it was. I was hoping you would get cast considering you were the only one who could read the lines properly"
"Oh, it's okay. I'm glad you think that"
"Sorry, but what' your name again?"
"My name is Alexis Little"
"Nice to see you again, Alexis. I'm sure you remember me"
"Who wouldn't remember you?"
And just like that, I was talking to one of Hollywood's finest like we were long time friends. He told me what would happen at the read through and he even offered to give me a ride to and from. Of course, I accepted and we said our goodbyes. Now I was off sightseeing with my mom.
