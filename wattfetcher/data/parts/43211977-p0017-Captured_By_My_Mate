As I arrive to see Katlyn once again I see him standing next to me. Katlyn says "hey girl!" she continues "and friends?" Ethan takes his hand and shakes it and says "boyfriend" Katlyn replies while smiling "oohh, I-I-I never knew about him. He is one sexy man." I lowly growl and she says "I know him." I reply "wh-wha-what? Sex buddies?" She says "no" "how then"i ask as she replies "wolf friends" I say "your a fucking wolf too and I didn't know" she says "sorry I-I did..." I stop her and say "it's ok" and he grabs me by the ass and once again. Plants his lips on mine I groan in pleasure as I murmur with my little bit of breath "Ethan." While I pull away Katlyn says "Yall look like damn mates" and I reply "beacause we are" he smirks at me. we then go into the club as I get drunk.
