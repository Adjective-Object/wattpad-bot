Erin's POV
Boo was at her dad's house and Jordan and I were pulled over far from it.
"Are you ok?" Jordan asked.
"No!" I screamed.
"Hey, come here." He said reaching his arms out for me. I leaned into his arms and he squeezed me and kissed my head.
"He doesn't stop." I said.
"I noticed." He said to me making me get the feeling of "finally someone understands".
"What do I have to do to make him stop?" I asked.
"In my opinion you shouldn't have to do anything."
"Yeah, your the only one who gets it." I said still crying.
"Oh, I'm glad someone gets it at least." He said.
"I don't know why I got dizzy." I said.
"Okay, you could have told me that." He said.
"I had a beer, would that have done anything?" I asked.
"If you chugged it, yes." He chuckled.
I sigh, stop crying and kiss his shoulder, but I'm still upset. Is it bad to bury your feelings?
"What would you have done differently if you knew I got dizzy?" I asked.
"Baby, aww. I don't know, carry you to the car." He said.
"You almost did that anyway." I said.
"I would have gone through with it if I knew, please tell me things when it comes down to health or just anything, really. I love you, I care about you, and I definitely don't want you hurt. Emotionally or phisically, tell me if you're hurt. Did you chug the beer?" He said and asked.
"I will tell you, and no I didn't chug the beer, it took me about fifteen minutes -- ten minutes to drink."
"That's still kinda fast for alcohol, hon." He said.
"I -- just drive, please." I said.
"Alright." He said rubbing my thigh and pulling into the street.
We didn't talk the rest of the way back, we just looked at each other, held hands and felt awkward.
"Hey!" I said when I saw someone staring at Jordan with the most disgusted face I have ever seen someone make.
"You got a problem!?" I yelled.
"Erin, stop." Jordan said pushing my shoulders back so I would stop walking twards them.
"What? What's wrong with him?" I asked.
"Erin!" He said trying to get me into the house.
"What's your pro -- " I started crying and couldn't finish my sentence.
"Erin, What the hell?" He asked tucking the hair from in front of my face behind my ear.
"They were looking at you like you killed someone." I cried.
"I don't care. What's the matter with you." He said softly.
"They -- you didn't even -- whats wrong with them?" I asked pointing to my neghbor who I soon realized was a friend of my ex.
"How do you know Jordan? Huh? He didn't do anything to you." I asked
