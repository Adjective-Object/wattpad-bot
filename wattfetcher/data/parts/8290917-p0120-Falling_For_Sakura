"I think it should be strapless," Hayden said. All the brothers noticed Sakura had very nice shoulders and thought they were better bare.
"I want straps, thank you very much," Sakura said. "And it's my dress, so I do have a say in it." She eyed Hayden, telling him she meant what she'd said.
He chuckled. "Of course."
It was two hours later when the final design was done, mostly by Tristan, and by then it was nearly dinnertime.
The brothers went off down to the dining room with Mary and Katherine while Sakura went to change. The brothers were expecting her to join them, but she never turned up.
"Where is she?" Conrad muttered under his breath.
"Who?" Mary asked.
"Sakura," he said, agitated.
"If you're waiting for her, she's not coming," Mary said. "She said she's been slacking around for a couple of days now, and she needed to get back on with it."
The brothers weren't happy with the sound of that and wondered what she was doing.
