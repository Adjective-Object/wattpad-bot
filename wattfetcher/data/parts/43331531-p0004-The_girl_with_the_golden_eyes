"Ughh....." I wake up (For real now) to find Hazel and a boy with blond hair looking at me from above. Hazel smirked. "Where am I?""Well where in L.A. I called Will and my brother for back up because carrying you from Elysium to the Overworld took awhile. Both of us were exasusted and badly injured so I called Will cuz hes a doctor.""Hazel, both camps sent at least 10 search parties for you. Frank was devistated. You where gone for 2 weeks." Hazels bother said. What? "Actully, they where unconsious for half a week." Will chimed in."How are we gunna get back? I don't want to ride Arion again. I almost lost my breakfast.""Shadow travel?" Nico asked"Fine. But you'll have to take extra medication." Will told Nico.Hazel to my hand and Will's while Nico took Will's. Hazel told us to run then we dissapered into the shadow.
We reappered in the streets of New York. Will, Nico and Hazel left me to go home. At the House, I was welcomed back by getting a huge group hug, and a personal hug from Zia. I huged her back and quietly sobed in her sholder. She held my head and reasured me. I missed her.Walt did fine taking care of the House and I silently, everynight fall and morning, I take a few mintues on my balcony, over looking New York, hopeing to meet Hazel, Will and her mysterious brother one more time.
And that is the end of my story, The Girl with the Golden eyes.
