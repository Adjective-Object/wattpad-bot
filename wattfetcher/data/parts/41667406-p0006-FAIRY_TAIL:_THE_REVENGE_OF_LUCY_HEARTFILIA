(Brielle's forms part one/ five)Brielle's pov: I put on a plaid crop top with a knot at the end above my belly button showing off my Dragon belly pirece leaving the first three buttons open showing off most of my cleavage, faded denim ripped short shorts, putting my hair in a french plait, putting on my real diamond limiter, black knee high heeled boots  grabbing an apple and waking up Niamh giving her a fish and Pantherlily too we were about to leave when two arms wrapped around my waist "mornin' baby why did you wake up so early" I said trying to get out of his grip but he had to tighten it so using my mind I summond my most powerful armour ever "requip SEDUCTION ARMOUR" a black with metal chained thong, a black with metal chains and iron studs, a maid hat that had chains , fishnet tights with black studded stilettos and hand cuffs "is this what you want Gajeel-Kun" I said seductivly "fuck bunny you always know my weakness" he said grabbing the blondes waist but she had a trick she requiped her outfit  back to her origanal outfit "you - will - get - sex - later baby we have to go to the guild now get dressed" she smirked leaving the aroused Iron dragon slayer standing there shocked but watching her swing her hips. At the guild (Brielle's pov): "Ohyao minna" "Ohyao Lucy" they all said "LISTEN UP MY NAME AIN'T LUCY ITS BRIELLE GET IT RIGHT" the blonde said scarier than Erza and Mira togethet " Listen up brats we are goinb to participate in the GMG so Team A consists of Princess Brielle,Lady Minerva, Titana Erza, Demon Mirajane and Sky Maiden Wendy, Team B consists of Black Steel Gajeel, Rufus, Jellal, Freed and Romeo now you will all be training for one and a half month and telax for the rest we will be going to Akane Resort and the winning team will get a mystery prize now go to the A team hotel (Pretty little liars season six is on netflix) They will be giving you you'r rooms andthe pairs are Brielle and Gajeel, Minerva and Rufus, Erza and Jellal, Mira and Freed, Wendy and Romeo now go brats before I change my mind" Makrov said until he felt a really really scary aura scarier than the scariest horror movie ever " WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT CALLING US BRATS GRAMPS" I said causing everyone to cower even Gajeel cowered "Hehe not to call any of you brats and if I did I had to pay 1thosand jewel to you" Master Makrov said giving her the money "Now go before I kill one of you" the Angry mage said pushing both teams out the door.At the hotel. Gajeel's pov: After watching bunny girl tease me like that she is going to get it hard so hard she wont be able to walk but training is important we went to a training ground outside the hotel "OPEN!
