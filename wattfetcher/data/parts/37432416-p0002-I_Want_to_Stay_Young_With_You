Luke POV
After Mary and I finished a gazillion rounds of Pok√®mon battles, we both went back to our own homes. It was SO FUN! I love going up to the treehouse and being around Mary. I really love her. As a friend of course. I mean I think I love her as a friend only... When I first came to America in Kindergarten, everyone would tease me. They'd laugh at me because of my Aussie accent. But Mary stood up for me. She always does. Sometimes I feel bad because I think she does too much for me. That's why I love her, and not just as a friend. I think I have a crush on Marian Elise Farrows.
