After biology, I went to my English and French classes. Lunch is very early in the morning. Its starts at 10:15 and ends an hour later. Luckily, it doesn't count as a period because it's too long.
I went into the cafeteria and spotted Max waiting in line. I passed a few people to catch up to her.
"Hey, Max." I said as I reached her.
"Hello, Red." Max called back. She sometimes calls me by my last name.
"Where's Alex?" I asked.
"She's up in the front of the line." She said. "You know how she comes before us."
"Yeah." I agreed.
"Bro. Why is he always here?" Max whined.
"Who?" I questioned as I turned around.
"Hey, Jesse." Max and I said in unison.
"Hello, tomboys." He replied.
"Hey, can you do me a favor?" I asked.
"Sure. Anything for you." Jesse replied. I saw Max smirking at the corner of my eye.
"Ok. Can you go away?" Jesse turned around and looked at his group of friends motioning him to go their way.
"Fine." He agreed. He left and went to his group of dumb athletes.
"I'm sorry." I apologized.
"It's ok. It's not your fault he can't get enough of you." Max responded. The line moved up and we got our lunch. We found Alex sitting at a table. We walked over to her and sat down.
"Maxine. Charlotte. Welcome." Alex greeted.
"Alexandria." Max and I exclaimed. We all started to laugh.
"What kind of food is this?" Max asked.
"Looks like mashed potatoes." I informed.
"For real? Are you sure?" Max continued to question.
"It is, Max! If you actually tried it." Alex blurted out.
"Fine. I'll try this garbage." said Max as she stuffed the food into her mouth. I tried the potatoes, too.
"It's ok." Max managed to say.
"I guess so." I agreed.
"You guys are so picky." Alex came in.
"Not my fault." I responded.
"It would taste better with gravy, though." Max admitted. Alex and I nodded in agreement.
"Oh, Charlie. Max and I are gonna go to the movies this weekend. You wanna come?" Alex asked.
"Sorry. I can't." I rejected. "I have to go to my dad's house for the weekend."
"That's sad. Well, at least you're going to be staying in a mansion. That's good." Max said.
"You might say so." I replied. My dad, Robin Red, owns a huge company that makes him a billionaire. He lives in a huge mansion with his new family. My parents got divorced when I was 4 and when Logan was about to be born. My dad cheated on my mom for 2 years before they separated.
We finished our lunch right before the bell rang. For the rest of the day, I went to my algebra, P.E., and history classes. After the school bell rang, I started walking to my bus until someone stopped me.
"Hi, Charlie!" Lily shouted.
"Hey, Lily." I waved.
"You're going on the bus?" She asked.
