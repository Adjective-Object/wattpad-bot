Man. A lot of you guys votes this ship out in the last chapter. I personally don't know much about this ship. I think it's cute but I think Twilight belongs to either Flash or Rainbow. Also I'm starting a new way to do this poll book. Instead of doing all the votes in total from all the chapters in the category, it will only be the votes from the latest chapter. So that means the first one to get five votes on the latest chapter will be out. Also this means the whole thing about having to wait for the one you voted for to be out to vote again doesn't exist anymore. Hope this makes things easier and more fun. So Let's Get Started.

And the nominees are:
CHEESEPIE
PINKIEFAVOR
POKEYPIE
DISCOPIE
PINKIESPIKE
FLUTTERMAC
FLUTTERBURN
BULKSHY
FLUTTERSPIKE
FLASHLIGHT

Good luck to the nominees!
