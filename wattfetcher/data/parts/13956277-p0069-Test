"I hit my head not my eyebrow, I can raise it as much as I want" She started wiggling her eyebrows.
"HAHHAAAHAHA you- HAHAHAH" I teared a bit
"You're an idiot" She chuckled.
"I also got you this" I pulled the roses I was hiding behind my back, Leena gasped.
"Y-You, Uhh, thank you but I can't take it"
"I knew it, that's why I'm gonna put it in this vase and leave it here" I stood up and brought a vase.
"I won't water them" She crossed her arms over ger chest.
"Don't worry, I'll pass by" I chuckled.
"Oh Allah, what did I do to be punished and be forced to put up with this idiot" She rubbed her face, I laughed loudly.
"I need to do wadu'" Leena stood up and walked to the bathroom but I felt her losing her balance, I ran and caugh her.
"Are you Okay" I asked worriedly.
"Yes Yes put me down"
"No, I'll take you to the bathroom to make sure you don't fall or lose your balance again" I winked at her. Wait, that wasn't proper.
"You pervert" She slapped me, Okay I deserved that one, I let her and she got in the bathroom and closed the door.
"I want you out of my room when I get out" She said.
"Okay Okay" I whimpered and walked out.
I waited for her nervously, I was scared that she might fall again.
I heard the bathroom door.
I watched her from the little space that's for the key. She stood up, raised her hands to her ears.
"Allaho Akbar" What ? then she started whispering some words I understood none of, so I walked in and stood beside her.
"Allaho Akbar" She said and bent down, I did the same ,she must've felt my appearence beside her.
Leena started whispering some words and I did the same and said " Sobn ralathim sobn ralathim sobn ralathim" I said .
"Allaho akbar" Leena said then knelt and put her forehead on the floor and whispered some words so I did the same and said "Sobralala sobralala sobralala" We repeated all what we did 4 times then she looked at her right shoulder then left one and whispered some thing and I repeated.
"What were you doing" She raised an eyebrow.
"I was about to ask you the same question"
"I think I yold you to get out" Why is she being so cruel ? I'm just trying to get closer to her and she keeps pushing me.
"What does sobralala mean ?" I wanted to know.
"What ?" She stared at me.
"Sobralala! you said it when your forehead was on the floor" And she bursted out in laughter.
"HAHAHA- Yo-HAAHAHAHA ... I said subhana rabbeya ala'laa" She continued laughing.
"Get out, NOW" She said agressively.
"Why do you keep doing this ! I'm being nice to you"
"I told you to get out, we shouldnt be together alone"
"I won't bite *wink* not much" Why do I keep ruining things with my perverted tongue ?
"You better get out before I get angry ... and you know what I can do when-"
