My friend and me were thinking of a plan and he's like
"We'll since you're pretty-"
*cue my insane laughter*
Everyone stared at me, I started crying that's how hard I was laughing
And he's like
"Pretty freaking ugly"
I just kinda smiled meanwhile hating myself at the same time because I was laughing because it was one of the first compliments someone gave in a long time
But at least I got a good laugh out if it
