Hi guys - here's a little story that i wrote about a year or so back but never got round to publishing it. I came across it again when i was clearing up some storage and memory space on my computer and thought i'd refine it and share it with you guys.
I hope you enjoy this. I know it's not one of my best fanfictions tbh but here ya go anyway.
