Save me, save me
From myself,
All these emotions,
These thoughts,
Save me
Save me, save me
From society's mind,
It's a dark cloud of suicide,
Save me
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Save me, save me, save me
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
I'm stuck in this place
This lost mind has fell from its grace
Stab me, stab me
This is what I want
Fuck it, just grab the god damn gun
Don't save me, don't save me
I'm already dead
Don't save me, don't save me
There is so much red that I've bled
Don't save me, don't save me
Enslave me
I'm already dead
I'm already dead
I'm already dead
Don't save me
