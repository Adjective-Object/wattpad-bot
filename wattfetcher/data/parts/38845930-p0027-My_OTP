Erin's POV
Boo had some trouble sleeping last night so I lied down with her 'till she fell asleep.
"Hi." I said as I entered her room.
"Lay here." She said when she pointed to part of the bed next to her.
"Okay, you sleepy?" I asked.
"Mmm hmm." She nodded as she snuggled her little body up into my arm.
"Good night." I said.
"Night, mommy." She said.
"I love you." I said.
"I love you, mommy." She mumbled.
at around 4 am, I realized I was still in Boo's room. I carefully slipped out of her room and into mine without making noises. I got into my bedroom and started to change into more comfortable clothes when I heard breathing. Jordan was sleeping there. It completely slipped my mind that he had a key. I snuck under the covers, kissed Jordan's head and fell asleep.
"Good morning." Jordan said when I woke up.
"Hi!" I said enthusiastically.
"Did you know I was coming?" He asked.
"No, but when I heard breathing in my room last night I was hoping it was you." I said. He laughed.
He sat up and took my hand.
"Hey." He said.
"Hey, Jordan." I replied.
He chuckled and looked at our hands.
"The first thing I thought when I heard you breathing was "I am about to die", but then I realized it was you sleeping. It was still weird cause I didn't know you were gonna be there." I said.
"Yeah, I didn't indicate I was coming at all, did I?" He asked.
"Not at all." I said.
"When I got here I came to the bedroom thinking you'd be there and you weren't, so I went to Boo's room, kissed your heads and went to bed." He said.
"Boo's head too? Aww." I said.
"Oh yeah, of course." He said.
"Aww, you're so sweet." I said.
"Thank you." He said. I sat up and kissed him instead of a "You're welcome".
"Thank you again." He said.
"Any time." I said.
"Ooh, any time?" He asked.
"Yeah." I said.
"When I kissed Boo's head, she breathed in really heavily and I thought she woke up, then you moved your head and I thought you woke up." He said.
"I remember her breathing really heavy and then I moved to make sure I was still holding her, I guess you were there." I said.
"That seems creepy." He said with a face of "oops". --doesThat make sense?--
"Yeah." I said.
