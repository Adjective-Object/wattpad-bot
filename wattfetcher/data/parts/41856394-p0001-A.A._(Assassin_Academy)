As part of AA (Assassin Academy) my life has changed. Life is different. I now know that myths, legends, hoaxes are real and AA "preserves the peace", between them. Everything and everyone knows their boundaries, and not to act aggressively towards one another otherwise AA will intercede. AA calls the aggressive acts "X" events. An "X" is what we call the non-humans as an identification. AA involves a group of special individuals that will kill at any cost. My team involves a group of 8, class 1. (the deadliest class)
