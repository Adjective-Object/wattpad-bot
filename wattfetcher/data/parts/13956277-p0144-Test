It's now or never ...I'd either wake up or never do.
I stood in front of my mirror, stared at myself, "What have I done to myself?" A tear rolled down my cheek."I can stay like this and make more mistakes, or I can stop makimg mistakes" I opened my closet and stared at my loose clothes.
"We shall never live this whole life and do whatever we want and forget about the second life after death" I didn't grab a maxi skirt, neither did I get a lose blouse.
I pulled a black loose Abaya.
I didn't want to get back the way I was before this whole thing happened, I wanted to be even better than I already was.
........
"Is it Halloween yet?" Simon chuckled as he opened the door for me, "Where is Molly ?" I asked while my gaze was on the floor,"What's all that shyness for?" Simon grabbed my chin but I slapped hus hand away."You can't fool me, once you become cheap and low you don't just get back to the top" He mocked. I tried my best to stop myself from slapping him, "Hi, how are you Leena, it's nice to see you again" Molly ran and hugged me.
.......
"WHAT?" Molly screamed, "Then I got pregnant" I teared, "How could you ! How could you leave your deen for some stupid guy like Simon, I'm going to kill him" Molly stood up but I grabbed her arm, "It's too late, you can't change anything" I sighed, "What are you going to do now?" She asked.
What am I going to do ?
"Obviously, I have ruined my first life, I don't have to ruin my second one. Screwing up in the life doesn't mean that I can't have a place in Jannah for my second permenant life" I said, "What are you going to do then?" She sighed.
"It's WE. I need your and Tom's help. Here's the plan ....."
Allah always forgives, but you have to ask for his forgiveness and work to get it.
"Fine, we'll start tomorrow morning, at 7" Molly smiled widely.
I lef the house with a smile, but then I saw Simon in the garden, he didn't look happy, I wished I could run and hug him to make him feel better, I wished I could laugh out loud and have a fight with him, I wished I could draw a cat on his face again, but I will NEVER do the same mistake twice.
