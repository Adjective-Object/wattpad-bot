The grass silently dies, as your heavy booth crushes it
Destroying, chlorophyll
The window howls silently, traveling through your hair
Swiftly, endlessly
The sky above is hopelessly careful, to cradle you
Widely, vastly
Creaking groans of each step echoes loudly
Through the house, the small corridors
Each one placed with such dignity
Losing the respect, of the foundation
You stop right there, silently watching
Eyes fall to my hands, resting, scared
They were cut deep by you through me
Damn you.
Leave your ammunition at the doorway, for it is not needed here
Do not come across the threshold, if you mean to stay
Tears won't stop themselves from ripping apart my face
As you do so anyways, always disrupting my life
The life I wanted so badly you to want, to crave
I only wanted you to see me, as I really was
The young girl swept up in the lust of the storm which yearned
I only asked you to be with friend, lover, or me
Whichever it was I matters naught, it's been ruined, stained
Take my hand, press me tight
To your sturdy chest, kiss my fingertips
Lie and say that it's always been alright, that I
Was the one you wanted, needed
How could you have lied to that young girl
She was so stupid, careless
How could you have led me to believe
That we were something more
How was it that your touch was poison
Yet it was so sweet, it killed me
Your curse, my burden, scars and burns Left a numb, broken, mechanical drone Drenched in oil and blood by your narcissistic, revolting Smile, ignorant of the destruction left in the air
Together we endured each blow to our respective side
I can still feel what your touch is capable of doing to my body
Yet without your hands around me, the past still comes through
Reminding me of the reasons we put ourselves through this hell
It was what they call,
Love.
