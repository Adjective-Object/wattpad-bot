//Third Person PoV//
They all went back to where the rest were and gave them the "good news".
"Oh, you found an exit?" Russia asked.
England breathed a sigh of relief and motioned them to follow him. "Yeah! We can finally escape! Come on, let's get out of here."
"Shouldn't we hurry?" Italy told them nervously.
America shook his head and grinned. "We already have an exit secured! I want to explore a little! All I've seen was the basement; I want to go upstairs, too!"
"Germany, you go ahead with the others. When America is like this, nothing can stop him." Canada sighed and rolled his eyes over to his brother.
_____ walked over to the Canadian and tapped his shoulder.
"Hey, uhm, Canada.. Thanks for carrying my bag for me. I'll be taking it now."
"Oh..you're welcome, ______. Are you sure it's not too heavy for you?" he asked, worried about the girl's condition.
She flung the bag over her shoulders and gave a thumbs up. "Nah. It's fine~ Thanks."
"Well, we have to make sure that that rope isn't rotten. We'll go ahead and see if there isn't any problem." Germany announced.
China spoke up, " I'm splitting up for a while! I found some Chinese medicine that I wanted; I'll go get it!"
Everyone agreed to go about the house for a while before going home. As they were exiting the room one by one, Prussia called out, " Japan! Stay back; I want to have a word with you. The others can wait in the other room."
This made the Japanese man turn around with a puzzled expression on his face. He was silent for a while, but decided to give in. "Very well."
Prussia was about to say something else, when he saw ____ from the corner of his eye and made his way over to the girl talking to Canada.
Canada faced the girl and spoke in a serious tone, "By the way, _____. I want to ask you about somethi--"
"Ah, sorry to cut in your conversation, but I need to talk to the frau." Prussia said, apologising to them for disturbing.
"B-But..uhm...fine... I'll just ask her later, eh? See you later." Canada waved before walking out of the room.
France suddenly raised an eyebrow and called out to his friend in a loud voice. "Hold on! I wanted to get to know about the petite fleur!"
Prussia could only stick out his tongue to his French buddy. "Too bad, frau and I are gonna exchange e-mails. You go along with the others!"
France gave a small pout before huffing out, " Fine, then. I'll see you later~"
With that, everyone left the room except the three.

"So, what's eating you two?" Prussia asked us after making sure the others were out of earshot.
I raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"
Prussia gave a skeptical look before speaking, " I'll start with you, Japan. I haven't been through it yet, but... you see things, don't you? When we break the clocks. C'mon, spit it out."
"... I'm sorry. I was trying not to show it." I admitted.
