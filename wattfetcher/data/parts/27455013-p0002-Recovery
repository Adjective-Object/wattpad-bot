"This is my...old friend..." He trails off, I'm guessing he didn't want to introduce me as his ex girlfriend to his new hot girlfriend who looked so much better. "Hi I'm Selena, it's very nice to meet you! You're so pretty!" Selena smiles towards me and all I could do was smile back, she's like one of the most gorgeous girls on the planet. "Thank you, but you're far more gorgeous" I smile towards her and she smiles back towards Justin, who was just looking down.
"I like her, maybe we could hang out together, like girl time." She giggles, well damn. I dont think if she knew I was Justin's ex girlfriend, she would be inviting me out to hang. "Well, I'm working on a new album, so it might not be a good time.." I try to say, hoping she'd get the message. "Oh that's great! What record label?" She asks, out of the corner of my eye I saw Justin shift uncomfortable I could tell he was uncomfortable with this. I couldn't blame him either. "Interscope Records." I smile and she gasp. "No way! I just signed on to there! " she giggles and I mentally face palm myself. Before I could respond I felt a pair of arms grab my waist.
"Hey baby, who are these people." Well it was pretty obviously who they were. "Shaun, this is Justin and his girlfriend Selena, Justin and I went to high school together." I introduce them, and I saw Justin's facial expression tense up. "Hi. I'm Shaun , Brooklyn's boyfriend." He smiled and shook Justin's hand. "Well it was nice meeting you, I'm gonna get going and I hope to see a lot of you!" Selena drags Justin and I sigh.
"So that's the Justin you were talkin about?" Shaun says turning towards me. "Yes, that's my ex boyfriend." I sigh. "We he isn't as good looking as me." Shaun scoffs and I laugh. "Come on let's eat I'm starving" I pull Shaun towards the pizza place.
