The Living Dead stood before the block with a crowd of townsfolk watching from a safe distance. Around these doomed prisoners were posted four Imperial Guardsmen clad in studded leather armor, swords hung from their hips and their steel helmets gleamed as if specially polished for this occasion; and perhaps they were, after all there was no task that an Imperial soldier delighted in more than the killing of a Stormcloak dog. The first man was called to the block and he came forwards stoically, his grimy face set in a look of stern concentration as he was pushed to his knees, his neck resting on the chopping block; no rites were read to this doomed soul and silence pervaded the village air, not even broken by the birds. The sound of an axe whistling through the air broke the tense silence around the block and then there was a muffled thump as the prisoner's severed head fell into the basket below the chopping block. Without hesitation the executioner's assistant dragged the body onto the growing heap of corpses to the left of the block as the Commander of the Guard read the next name off of his scroll."Albreich War-heart." He called in a gravelly voice. The man that stepped forwards was tall, broad of shoulder with shoulder length hair held back by a hurried looking braid, he was dressed as the other prisoners in a rough-spun tunic and breeches, his shoes and the clothes he had been interred in were gone, no doubt split between the soldiers who had arrested him for treason. He cast his eyes briefly towards the group of spectators, his eyes full of despair. But the look vanished as he turned towards his fate, jutting his chin upwards proudly as he walked onwards through the other prisoners and not going away when the commanding officer shoved him roughly to his knees and then planted her foot between his shoulders, forcing his head to the block. He lay with his eyes on the cloudless sky and as the executioner swung his axe up he said a silent prayer for his family. There was the whistle of the blade in the clear air and then-
Frieda sobbed openly, her hands pressing her eight-year-old daughter's face into her skirt though the child tried to look upon her father. Her husband was dragged off to the side and thrown carelessly onto the pile of other Empire deemed traitors. And what had they betrayed? Had it not been the Emperor who betrayed them to the vile Aldmeri? Her beloved Albreich had simply been fighting for his beliefs, fighting to gain his family freedom in their own homeland.The distraught widow could scarce pull her eyes off of the still form that was once so full of love and life, and so great was her anguish that she was not aware of the approaching soldiers until they had ripped the child away from her and seized her by both arms. The leader of the Imperials had been watching them with great interest and in her sorrow Frieda had not seen the gestures and speaking behind gauntleted hands. The girl began to scream as they hauled her backwards, her legs flailing wildly as she tried to escape her captors. Frieda felt the rough hank of rope binding her hands roughly behind her and then she was being dragged away from her child."Katya!" she screamed her daughter's name and the girl began to fight ever harder; as if they were not expecting this the guards lost their grip on the child and she stumbled towards her mother who was sobbing so violently that she was nearly blinded by her tears. But she was not so sightless that she could not see the Thalmor agent catch her child by the hair."Mama!" Her child's screams were the last thing that she heard as a hot bolt of pain was driven into her heart and all went dark.

"Clear the table girl." The sharp commanding voice of the Thalmor emissary to Skyrim 'Lady' Elenwyn filled Katya with hatred, she glared up at her Thalmor mistress as she started towards the breakfast table. When she had been taken from her home in Skyrim she was placed in the service of a high Aldmeri House, here she was a slave under the guise of a serving girl. She spent her days serving meals and cleaning up after the nobles who frequented her master's halls. And Elenwyn was the worst of all, when she came on her infrequent visits she was treated as if she were entirely stupid. For example, how was she to know that the Altmer were finished with their meal when the two of them were still picking at their plates and drinking their brandy? She was neither allowed to speak to them nor approach without their permission."I've told you and told you, time and again Loxias, these Nord servants aren't worth anything." Elenwyn sounded patronizing as Katya moved to fill her cart with dirtied plates and bowls and half-filled serving dishes. "They're spiteful and quite dim-witted. You ought to invest in some Argonian or Khajiiti help."Her master snorted, "And have them getting hooked on Skooma and moon-sugar while they're in my halls? I'd prefer not to. And besides, Katya is the only Nord in my staff, the rest are Dunmer refugees, and they are quite proficient.""But how do you deal with the creature's surliness? Surely you don't let such an unattractive being serve at your feasts?" Loxias chortled, "Oh Elenwyn, you of all Mer should know how to get what you want out of a Nord. Mere reasoning after all is no good." Here he whistled, a sharp quick sound. "Look here Katya."The girl looked up and immediately turned away again as Loxias drew out his light-whip and flicked it in her direction. She evaded the worst of the blow, catching the cat-o-nine tendrils across her cheek in an arching, fiery pain. But she did not cry out; nay she was well used to such sporadic beatings and in her short span of years had built up a tolerance to petty pains such as this. Instead she swiped at her cheek with the sleeve of her ragged gown, wincing as the rough fabric abraded the fresh wound. Hot blood seeped down her cheek, but she ignored it as well, hurrying to finish her cleaning and then hurrying out of the chamber, ignoring the turn in conversation as Elenwyn began to detail her most recent witch-hunt of Talos worshipping Nords.
