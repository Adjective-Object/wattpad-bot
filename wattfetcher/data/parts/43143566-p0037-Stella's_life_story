i woke up it was the same as any morning.i got up late and got ready so i could go to school and be late,get torchered and picked on,laughed at,and worse forgetting all about what happened in my parents room.
it was the same when i got home.me and alex hung out until she left.we listened to a song and ate.i got told to kill myself from bry and again mother was nieve to ask
,"why are you so upset."i got mad more and alex seemed to notice this.so she brought me outside so i could let my anger out.
after a half an hour she left with her father and i headed upstairs to my selfconsious cage where i listened to music and wrote messed up books.
i shook my head as i remebered my dream again.where exactly was a looking anyways?....wait..i never did..look..and check in THAT ROOM!!
i raced to the room in a hurry dropping my computer on my bed in the process.as i searched the room i saw nothing bad was there..i dont know why but a part of me was kind of dissapointed nothing happened.have could i have been so foolish,of course it was just a stupid dream..
