So, peeps, I wrote a thing. It's completed and everything. It's called Dear Diary. Dean gets Cas a diary after he becomes human, and fun ensues. Told through Cas' diary entries.
I'm so sorry if you thought this was an update, but you know... you could... go read... Dear Diary... (*WINK, WINK, NUDGE, NUDGE, HINT HINT*)
