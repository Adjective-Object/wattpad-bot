Stopping when he heard what Italy said, Germany spoke, "What?"
"...Feliciano and...Ludwig...?" America asked back, squinting his eyes.
Taking a breath of relief, Germany stepped closer, as well. " I-I see! So it's you!!"
"Aaaaah!! What the hell, you guys wound up here, too?! You scared-mmpf!" America exclaimed, but was made to stop when Italy covered his mouth with his hand.
Italy hushed him. "Quiet! They're upstairs!"
"Sorry, sorry! But I'm so relieved! I thought I was all alone here and felt pretty helpless. So, why is Germany crying?" America asked in a softer voice.
Germany facepalmed in embarrassment. "Why did he have to have such a sharp eye now of all times...?!"
"Oh, um...It's 'cause I died in this world. He just came back from saluting me." Italy answered.
America's eyes widened. "...I see. Then this really is the second time-"
"You were right, America...I died in the second time loop. But that isn't how I remember it..." Italy said with a troubled expression.
Shaking his head, America smiled. "I don't doubt your memories. Some thing must be going on...Thank you for trying so hard to help us, Italy."
"What? Oh...Oh, you mean the me from this world? Um...thanks to you, too." Italy said, smiling back.
Looking around, America spoke, "So, what are we going to do?! I wound up here because of the journal, so I figured that if I found it, I'd be able to go back-"
"We think so, too. But we don't have it, so..." Germany trailed off.
Italy sighed. "We can't take this world's journal, either. What are we going to do? I guess we'll just have to keep looking for it."
"You know...I've also been thinking...if we got here because we were around that journal...wouldn't (Name) be here, too?" America asked.
Germany raised an eyebrow. "(Name)? But we haven't seen her around at all...Where could she be?"
"Oh no! What if she ended up in some other room? What if the the nations of this time loop find her? Or...Or..." Italy began to panic.
America suddenly pointed down the hall. "....Or maybe she's running towards us?"
The remaining two men turned to see a (h/c) haired girl who stopped when she was finally beside the countries she knew was from the current time loop.
"Guys...Haa...You're...here...." she panted.
America glomped the girl. "Yeaah! (Name), we're glad you're safe."
"Air...Air..." the girl choked out, almost feeling the life being squeezed out of her.
Laughing, America let go of the girl. "Oops! Sorry 'bout that, dudette!"
"Man, your 'hero hugs' sure are lethal." (Name) joked.
They all chuckled a bit, but then stopped when they felt the ground below and practically everything else, violently shake.
"Whoa! Wh-what was that?" Germany asked, standing up after the shaking stopped.
Italy looked left and right. "An earth tremor? But it feels kind of different-"
"...England...? England's doing...something...What the hell? I don't know what he's trying to do, but it must be something absurd!!" America told them.
