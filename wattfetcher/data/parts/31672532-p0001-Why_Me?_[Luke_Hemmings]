"Why me?" I huff under my breath as I lay in my bed still. It's 9:37 am here in North Carolina and a Saturday. "ALEX COME DOWN STAIRS RIGHT NOW!" My dad screams too loud. It scared me so much I almost fell of my bed. Ugh can I just lay here and just forget the world? Did I just quote Snow Patrol? Whatever. I hop out of bed and throw on my glasses and run down the hall to the stairs to see my mom giggling. "What's so funny mom?" "Your father scared me when he called for you and made drop the laundry basket down the stairs!" It's still too early for this but I let out a subtle chuckle. "Alex I have such grand news for all of us to hear!" "Cool. What is it?" I reply. Ugh just get on with my punishment already. Wait, what did I do? Hell I don't even know."IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW OKAY?!" "YES SIR! So tell me please?" "We. Are. MOVING!!!" Stunned. Shocked! Angry even and I don't know why! I knew that my dads job made us move around a lot but we finally settled here in NC for 4 years and I love it here. "Where." "Sydney, Australia! I know it's-" "WHAT THE HELL?! AUSTRALIA?!" I cut him off. I am furious! I'm excited to go to Australia but I DONT WANT TO MOVE THERE! "I know but the promotion is the greatest one I'll get for my degree! We'll have a bigger house and you'll have a car this year! No longer riding the bus, AND the school we chose has great reviews and is better than the one you're in now. Please Alex I know we have settled here and it feels like home but, I am not leaving you behind or leaving my job. Plus it'll be a great experience!" Dad debates. I could feel tightness in my chest and a lump in my throat. I could only say two words, "Why me?"
