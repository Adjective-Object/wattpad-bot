Two days.
She was in a coma for two days.
She came out with selective memory loss.
Her mind tried to fix her by getting rid of all the bad memories.
She never lost her intelligence. Or her family.
Her old friends are nothing but faded dreams.
But what she does remember is the two of us.
When we were still friends.
But those memories are still there. Buried under the new ones.
I love her. And she's happy. Not as much before her accident, but what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
They said it was best if she found her own memories. The rest listened, I didn't. She needed someone who could give her back her life and I did.
A perfect version.
I won't let them destroy what I've done.
I will not let them cut the strings on my puppet.
