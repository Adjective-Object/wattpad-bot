No, this is no good. I just have to try harder.


What was I supposed to say next, again? Whose life was going to be in danger next, again? What... do I have to do next?


How many more times will I be allowed to make mistakes?
How many more times will I have to tell the same lies?
How many more times will I have to watch my friends die?


I made them so many promises. But when we met next, they had forgotten all about them. We had finally learnt to get along, but when we met next, they were all back to normal.


I don't want them to forget, though. What can I do? What do I have to do? How can I get them all out of here?


Haaa... It's hopeless. It feels like my head is going to burst...


I want to try harder... and harder... but... I'm so very tired...

Wiping sweat off my forehead and brushing out my (h/c) locks from my face, I turned the knob and stepped outside of the bathroom.

Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I saw someone leaning on the wall beside me, his arms crossed.

"Ciao, ragazza."

I turned to the man who called out to me. Out of all the Italians that could have possibly said that...it just had to be the worst.

"Luciano..." I spoke softly.

His magenta coloured orbs hinted a glint of bloody murder looming over me. Though, his expression looked blank, which scared me more. For a while, he did not speak at all. It looked more like he was thinking of something deeply. Was he planning on how he's going to kill me...? I pray that that's not the case.

He suddenly gave a small chuckle and then spoke, "Heh. I've gotta hand it to you, ragazza... You've got some nerve trying to escape and head over to those First Player bastardos."

I looked down, the feeling of defeat was starting to sink in.

"Hmm? Does this mean that you've become heartless, after all? Mama and Papa not that important to you?~" he asked me, his tone almost playful, but gave me a stab of throbbing guilt.
