This
Is
Bad!!
I
Am
Having
Idiots
Block.
Yes
It's
A
Thing.
Idiots block is like writers block except for idiots.
I started school !! I have TWO friends!! OMG yayyyyyyy x)
I can't believe I have friends. Who don't call me emo.
You know how cool that is???
Anyway, I feel as if I owe you guys a chapter.
A rant or fangirling chapter, since you guys seem to like those.
Any ideas?
I can literally rant on anything.
Like that marshmallow I didn't eat, or that kid in your class you hate, or I can FANGIRL about my gym teacher who looks like Nico with short hair.
Those are some ideas.
Now I will do everything you guys want me to do. I am forever your loyal servant.
Yes, I am simply one hell of a butler.
~insert ideas here~
Okay! Bye!!!
Nico: *whispers* she's doing this ' cause she needs a life and hates school....
Me:..... It's true.... But also cuz I love seeing your comments xD
