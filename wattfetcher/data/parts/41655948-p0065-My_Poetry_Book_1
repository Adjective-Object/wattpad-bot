You tell me to meet you at midnight. 11:55 rolls around and I crawl into your window, tumbling onto your carpet. You see me and smile like you've been just waiting for me. You take my cold hands in yours and you promise me something. 'We are infinite' you said. I wanted to cry because nothing I've ever known at the time was infinite. I said 'Okay'. I lived off of our promise, not daring to think you'd break it. I let myself fall into the depths of your beautiful soul. You were all I thought about. And each night, I'd meet you at midnight, clambering in through your window of promise. We smoked and talked and I fell in love with you more and more each night. You were so beautiful.
Until you weren't.
You left me behind in the darkness today. You closed your window of promise, shattering our infinity. But it's not over for me. It never is. Every night, every word you spoke haunts my thoughts like a ghost.
It's been ahwile. I've forgotten what your voice sounds like. I don't remember what color your carpet is. I can't drink away the sadness consuming me. I want you back. I don't want to see the future if it doesn't include you. Somebody come help me.
I climb in through your window tonight, entering an empty room full of darkness and despair. You haven't been home in about a year but everything still smells like you. I climb into your bed and wrap myself in your sheets. The smell of stale cigarette smoke lingers in the air. I cry. I miss you.
