(Name) nudged the German man beside her and whispered. "...Just tell him the truth." This made Germany give her a confused look for a moment, but then nodded.

"...We're looking for the journal." Germany told Past England.

Italy tugged his friend's sleeve. "Germany!"
"We can't find it anywhere. Without it, we can't go back. That's why..." Germany explained.
Past England chuckled sarcastically. "Hah! Then fucking go back already. Always loitering around and making a racket, you lot..." he scolded, throwing the journal over to them. The girl was able to catch it just in the nick of time.
"The journal! It was with you, England?!" Italy said, completely dumbfounded.
Past England nodded weakly. "I found it on the first floor...Ugh!...What the hell?! You've got to run! They're feeding it!" he warned them frantically.

"Wh-what? What are you...talking about?" Italy asked.
With a loud slam of the door, a giant alien-like creature entered the piano room.

"It's here. You guys go back. Don't intervene anymore!" Past England shouted at them.

America's heart pounded from fear.Â  "W-wait! Are you going to fight alone?! You can't!"

"They're feeding it...Who? The enemy? My wounds..." Italy tried to think.

Just as he did, a memory began to flash before him. A memory that almost sank in the back of his mind, but resurfaced once more.

It was a memory of Past England warning him about...something.

"Sorry, we don't have much time. You're going to die very soon. Just listen to what I have to tell you." Past England said.
Italy gave him a puzzled look. "What? Wait...I don't understand..."
"Just listen to me! That's all you've got to do! Don't go to the second floor. That's all." Past England quickly stated.

The giant alien-like monster began edging closer over to Past England.
"Oh..." Italy muttered as he remembered and realised what was going on.
Past England clicked his tongue. "God, what a nuisance!" he shouted as he pointed his hands at the four.
A light suddenly glows around Italy, Germany, (Name), and America.
"I can't move!" America exclaimed, trying to get his feet up to walk over to Past England. Try as he might, he simply can't do it now. Neither of the four could.
Past England faced them and gave a weak smile. "Don't worry. I'll die before it can attack you I'll teleport you back with the journal using what little magic I've got left..."
Germany shook his head. "Wait! You're-"

"Please, cut it off." Past England told them, shaking his head. He didn't want to hear any more of their cries. It was too painful.
