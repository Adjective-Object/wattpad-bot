"Babe. Aw how cute." Tino said, "You two will be the death of me."
"Good."
"No, not good. I hear you two talk all the time and got its gross."
"What do you mean it's gross?" I asked, "We're never talking about anything gross."
"Its sick how cute you two are together. Like the fans are calling you guys cashby and man some of them are creative."
"You're just jealous. Aaron is the same way with Amanda and Phil is all cheesy and weird when he's talking to his wife." I said rolling my eyes. "We're not the only gross ones."
"Well at least they don't have fanfictions about them."
"Fanfiction?" Alan asked.
"Oh yeah fanfiction."
"That's weird." I said scrunching my nose.
"I can't believe there's fanfiction about me." Alan muttered, "That's so.... cool!"
"Cool? Its weird." I said, "It's like reading about yourself."
"Wait, have you read them?" He asked.
"No..."
"Oh my god, Austin! You have!"
"Have not!"
"You liar."
"I read one okay! I was curious." I admitted.
He laughed, "You're too cute."
"I know I am."
"I'm gonna read one. I wanna see how cute I'm portrayed."
"I wouldn't read them if I were you."
"And why not?"
"One word: smut." I told him, "Lot's of it too."
"Well that should be interesting."
"Yes it will." I said.
"Come on lets go read some." He said grabbing my hand and pulling me back to my bunk. He grabbed his computer. "What did they call us again?"
"Uh cashby." I said, "Babe do you really think we should be reading this together? It feels awkward already and we haven't even started."
"Oh calm down its fine." He said, "If you don't want to you can go."
"Fine I'll just stay."
He smiled and lean up kissing me, "You're great."
"I know I am." I said smiling, "Now find one to read."
He nodded and scrolled through a few and picked a random one.
"I can't believe we're reading this together." I muttered.
"Hey I told you that you can leave. I'm curious as to what kids are writing about my boyfriend and I."
"I know you did but now I'm curious."
"Just shut up and read it."
"You're bossy." I said and started reading.
"Shush."
"So bossy, Will you read it to me?" I asked him getting bored.
"Oh no, you can read this to yourself." He said blushing.
"Babe come on! Read it to me." I whined, "It would make the whole thing so much better."
"Then it has to be a different one I can't read this one it's too smutty to read aloud."
