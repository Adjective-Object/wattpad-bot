" he will be fine " she added I guess she saw the worry in my eyes
" I'm gonna go check on him"  I said walking out the door and looking around
" justin" I called out then I heard a clatter in the distance I followed the noise and saw justin punch a metal dumpster then he turned  around to face me
" leave me alone kylie " he sighed sitting in the grass
" never "  I said sitting beside him in the grass
" never say never" he joked
" what's wrong justin"  I asked
" my dad he's back  " he said softly
" shouldn't you be happy"  I asked confused
" he left us  he thinks he can just come back and pick up where he left off he missed alot its been 17 years " Justin sighed
" well give him a second chance "  I said
Justin POV
" well give him a second chance" she said
" ok  just for you " I said
I think I should tell her  like tonight.
Looks like someone's learning
Shut up
I looked over at kylie and crashed my lips into hers and at first she didn't kiss back but then she did  and I ran my hand  down her back and stopped her  hips and then she pulled away
" kylie" I whined
" sorry justin" she said biting her lip and walking off
Man I hate when she does that
Then as kylie walked in the house I received a text  and read to see who it was from  selena it read
J= justin s= selena
S= justin your gonna have to tell her  if you don't I will
J=  I'm not telling her
S=  well I guess.I'll tell her   and remember the deal
J= selena wait meet me in a few minutes I'll make something up ok
S= ok same place
J= yeah bye see you in a few
S= can't wait   ;-)
Then I put my phone away
I can't  believe your gonna meet her
Shut up
What about kylie
What she don't know won't hurt her
Your turning into your father justin
I'll never be him ever ok fucking get it
How do you live with yourself
