I've always had trouble finding love. Any kind of love I struggled with. My parents weren't too happy with me because I couldn't find a boyfriend as quick as my friends and siblings. Sometimes I think that maybe they don't love me either......
I always was bullied about not finding love when I was a teen. I know I was made fun of over something dumb right? They told me I would never find love. That I would be lonely forever.
Finally in college I found a boyfriend. Oh god I felt amazing! I was the happiest girl in the whole entire world. My mom was finally proud of me.
I had the whole amazing time. Yet after 4 months dating he broke up with me. Apparently it was all a joke. He only dated me because he felt bad. It's not like I'm fat or ugly. I am 5'5" and 120lbs. I had the perfect grades, perfect height, perfect body and I had the perfect everything else too. I've been told by many magazines that I should go for modeling because of my good looks and perfect body.
But that all changed when I signed up for the bachelorette. I never thought I would actually get chosen! I had 24 hours to get all packed up.
