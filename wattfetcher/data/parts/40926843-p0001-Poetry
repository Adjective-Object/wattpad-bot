there's one thing I see only one thing I seehis name is satanhe lives within me
he knows no lovehe has no fate he only knows hellthat place I hate
he know no goodhe has no soulhe only know hellthe fire in the bowl
he knows no evilhe hath done no wronghe knows only hellnever to sing his song
satan lives within me his eyes golden brownhis hand warn as fire he lips never frown he knows only hell the soul he once hadit's gone nowto fucking bad
but thou hast remember evil come from good even satan himself beside god he stood and now he hath fallen far from the skyhe now lives within me but I hast not died
