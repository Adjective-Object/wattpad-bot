Sam was sick and tired of it.
So damned done.
Basically, the story was simple.
Sam, Dean, and Cas were hunting a witch. She had been putting people under love spells, driving them away from their actual relationships, to be with a stranger that they had just met, in most cases.
But Sam didn't think anything would happen when THEY tried to hunt her.
But he was wrong.
So wrong.
Sure, truth be told, he wanted Dean and Cas to be together so bad, he wanted them to admit their love and be together forever and all that good stuff.
But this?
This was sickening.
The witch had hit Dean and Castiel with the most powerful spell he had ever seen. He had thought that she was trying to kill them.
Nope.
She wanted to kill Sam's desire to do anything except vomit when around Dean and Cas.
They never stopped making out.
Never.
And if they ever did, it was to be one of THOSE couples, the ones who call each other names like "schmoopy-bear" and "baby-cakes," except Cas was Dean's "honeybee" and Dean was Cas' "wind beneath my wings."
Major. Vomit.
And all of this was during the daytime.
At night...
Sam couldn't even attempt to think about it.
So, it stands to reason as to why he tracked the witch down.
But what she said.
That killed him.
"The spell only lasts 36 hours! I swear!"
"Really? Then why the hell is my brother still calling his best friend the love of his life when you cast the spell four days ago?!"
She gasped.
"What?" Sam asked, panicked.
"The spell. It-It only lasts 36 hours. But, if-if-if it's TRUE LOVE, th-the spell lasts 5 days, because it gives the couple time to realize their feelings."
Sam was astonished.
And repulsed.
"Are you telling me... That I'm going to have to deal with that ANOTHER ENTIRE DAY?"
