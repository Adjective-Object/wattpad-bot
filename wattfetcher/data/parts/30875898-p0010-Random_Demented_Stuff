So has anyone else realized this. There are so many different websites for self-harm and suicide. I mean the site that are meant to help you are awesome, their really cool. But I mean, that if you look up, 'How to tie a noose' on google, you would get at least five websites, disgrams, pictures, and even videos. Tell me that's not just a little bit messed up... I mean just a little bit, right?
