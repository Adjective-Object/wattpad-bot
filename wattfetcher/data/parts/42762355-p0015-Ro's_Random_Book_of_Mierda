//Finns are listening to the radio//
"During Juhannus three people drowned. Police wasn't extremely needed. Well, of course in East Finland and Ostrobothnia the forces were needed, but that isn't actually news..."
My family: //starts laughing like nasty perverts//
Why do we take pride in this...? XD Jesus fucking tulips... We are horrible.
South: //going on about how much better his people are//
East, North and West: //still drunk as fuck// :'DD Niggaaah
//In Finland people are just calling each other niggas .__. Why? Because apparently we can. But bitch we white tho D:< Get your shit together people...
We also keep on doing this racist thing with candy. Like we give them racist ass names like "Kiss of a nigger" and "Liqourice Pekka". (Laku Pekka comes from "Musta Pekka" (Black Pekka), who is the Spanish Santa's African helper .__. //We also made card games about him--//)
This is what I hate about Finns.//
But we got into the news tho XD Bahahaha, fahk ye South, we awesome.
