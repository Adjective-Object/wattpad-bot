Lots of you guys are leaving, and you have every right to. You do what's best for you, and I know I've though about deleting. The drama is overwhelming, but it's only gonna get worse if you fan the flames. sure, people make hate accounts, but they're a tiny match, don't be the kerosine. If someone makes a hate account block and ignore them, don't call them out on it and announce that you're reporting them. I've made so many great friends here, but if you want to go, go. We shouldn't stop you from making a decision that might better your life. Me, I've made my choices of staying, because I wouldn't leave the people I've come to befriend and love. Good luck with whatever decision you're making, and I wish you happiness.
