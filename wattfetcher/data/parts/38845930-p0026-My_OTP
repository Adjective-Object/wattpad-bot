Jordan's POV
A few days after Erin stayed the night, we did a building game, the theme was favorites.
"I wish I could write down you on my paper." Erin sent me in private Skype chat.
"I thought the same thing." I wrote back.
"Alright, I put it in the thing and it didn't say I did and it took my paper." Said Steve.
"Put another paper in." Erin said.
"I did that twice and it did the same thing." He said.
"Try throwing it on the other side." Blue said.
"Yeah, that works." He said.
About half way through the building game Erin private messages me.
"I tried to build "1d only you" and it made me think of you, only you." She said.
"I shouldn't know what you built." I answered.
"Oops. I needed to say something though." She said.
Erin's POV
Once the building game ended, Jordan stayed on skype.
"Now I remind you of one https://m.facebook.com/airingCPAP ?" He asked.
"No, the song and the lyrics." I answered.
"Oh, the lyrics... yeah, the ones you don't know?" He asked.
"I know some of them." I said.
"Yeah sure, only some of them." He said.
"I don't know all of them, if I did I would say I did." I said.
"I don't even know how it goes." He said sounding ashamed.
"Do you want to know?" I asked.
"Not nesasarily." He said.
"Mommy?" Boo said just before she walked in the room.
"Oh, why are you up?" I asked.
"I can't fall asleep." She said.
"Aww, should I lay with you untill you fall asleep?" I asked.
"Yeah." She said as she cried a bit.
"Oh, don't cry, it's okay, I'll be there in second." I said.
"So, you gotta go?" Jordan asked.
"Yeah, talk to you tomorrow, bye." I said.
"Alright, love you." He said as he puckered his lip.
"Jordan. I love you."
