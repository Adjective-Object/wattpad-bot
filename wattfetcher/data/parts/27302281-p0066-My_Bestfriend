" Kylie " I said as she pushed past me and pulled out what was her's in my room and turned to walk out
" kylie " I said once more grabbing her arm
" so that was your unfinished business" she finally spoke up not facing me saying it as calm as ever
" tell me that what I heard wasn't real that she was lying and that you only love me and no one else " she said with no emotion facing me
" Kylie " I said softly not knowing what to say cause I can't lie and say it didn't happen
" call her and end your arrangement" Kylie cried finally letting her emotions break through I nodded and texted her then put my phone away
" no call her I want to hear you say it " she said sternly not letting her voice crack
I pulled out my phone and did as I was told then pulled Kylie into a hug
" we " she said motioning to me then herself " are finished" she added walking downstairs leaving me in my room.
For the first time in a long time I fell to my knees and cried not a "I just lost my goldfish"cry... a" I just lost my best friend" cry

Kylie POV
" kylie " christian screamed chasing me around the swing s
" just give up you ain't gonna catch me " I screamed backdodging between the swings and running around the merry go round and running staright for the plastic walls and hiding behind them . I peeked around the corner looking for christian I didn't see him anywhere thank god I lost him I thought catching my breath I turned around and screamed into Christian's chest
" christian you scared me you idiot " I said punching his chest harshly
" you should have seen your face " christian laughed leaning against the wall he stared at me laughing then stopped laughing and leaned in kissing me slowly i wrapped my arms around his neck and deepened the kiss then he pulled away and my eyes were widened so were his
" I'm so sorry " he said backing away from me
" same " I said touching my lips
" let's not tell anyone including justin he would kill me " he said
" agreed " I said staring at him then I kissed him again and he deepened the kiss and I wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck then he sat me down and I pulled away
" I thought" he started to say but I cut him off
" I didn't say I wasn't OK with it but your Justin's bestfriend I dont want to ruin that" I said pecking him on the lips
" let's head back " he smirked and I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his car he opened the door and stopped me from getting in with a kiss which I allowed and replayed the previous events then climbed in the car . He walked around the car and climbed in the driver's seat then grabbed my hand and started driving .
