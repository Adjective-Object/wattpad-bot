I slowly opened my eyes to see Andy. I stared at him almost in a daze, and reached up to softly touch his cheek. My face quickly flushed crimson and I looked away.
"My apologies if i woke you." He smiled and stood up. I start to reach for his hand but caught myself, just looking at him.
"I saw you in my dreams, and then here you were." I smile, looking him up and down. He smiled and looked down at the ground. I cleared my throat quietly.
"um..lay with me..?" I ask hesitantly, blushing. He looked up at me.
"Sure." I held open the furs for him to lay beside me. He slowly got in the bed. He hesitantly slip an arm to my waist. I smiled and I opened my mouth to say something but I then shut, blushing a little. I rolled over to look at him. He leaned forward and softly place his lips on mine. They were as soft as clouds. He softly pulled me closer, lightly tangling his fingers in my hair. I pulled back slowly, shivering as I listened to his blood pumping in his veins. He kissed softly along my neck and then pull away, looking into my eyes. I smile back as he gently pulled my head to his chest, and wrapping his arm around me. I pulled the furs over us, and smile, sighing contentedly.
"Its so quiet..." I say. Andy chuckled quietly and wink at me.
"Just let me know if you want to make some noise"
"Is that an option?" I asked. He blushed a bit and smiled.
"It is if you want it to be."
"Maybe I do..." I said and bit my lip, looking Into his blue eyes.
"Maybe..?" He asked softly.
"Maybe." I whispered.
