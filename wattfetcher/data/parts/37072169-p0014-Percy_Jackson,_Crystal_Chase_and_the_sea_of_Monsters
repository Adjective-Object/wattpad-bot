Instead of getting angry, I put on a smile. Percy seemed to relax a bit. That's when I lunged. We rolled around in the water, kicking and squirming.
Percy seemed confused. I don't know why but he was really confused about something.
After about half an hour of squirming and kicking and punching, we let it go because our little fight was starting to draw attention. I was out of breathe but Percy seemed just fine. Actually, he seemed a little better than before.
I sat at the river line and started complaining. It was getting chilly and I was drenched in water. I didn't mind being wet, I minded being wet when it was cold out. Percy was still sitting in the water
"Percy, I'm cold," I murmured.
"Oh yeah sorry, I forgot," he chided. He raised his hand and my clothes began to dry off. Yeah like just like that. As though the water was evaporating off of me. I stared at my clothes in amazement. They were completely dry now. Percy's hand dropped and he grinned at me.
"How did you do that?" I asked, mystified.
He didn't reply for a while. He kept staring at the space above my head. His face scrunched up as though he were trying to figure something out.
Suddenly he said, "I'm Poseidon's son so I can control water and apparently i'm not the only one. Your my little sis."
