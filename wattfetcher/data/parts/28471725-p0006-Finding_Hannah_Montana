"Okay thats enough. I'm going to sleep." I yawn turning over on the couch and closing my eyes.
"What! But what happens to Elena?" Quintin ask.
"I thought this show was to girly for you." Payton says lying on the other end of the couch.
"Yeah well, that was before. Now Elena's car is on top of her and a strange figure is about to attack." Kyle snaps.
"Take it to your room. But if you scratch my disc, you die." I threaten before going out like light.
I wake up and look at the clock. Four pm. Payton is still asleep so I kick her. She glares at me and then we both burst out laughing.
"Your face!" She says in between breaths.
"Mine! Look at yours!"
We walk over to a bathroom to look in a mirror. "Does it wash off?" I ask.
"Yeah. Who ever did this was stupid enough to use a Crayola marker." She says.
We wash our faces and walk into the kitchen to find my Dad.
"Hey dad where were you yesterday?" I ask realizing I hadn't seen him or the kids.
"The little ones and I went to stay a night at your Aunt Rachel's house."
"Oh, is that the aunt with cancer?" Payton ask.
"Yeah. How's she doing?" I ask my dad.
"She's getting better. She, Uncle Tom, your mom and I are leaving for a small vaction in a few minutes."
"How long are you gonna be gone?"
"A week. So while we're gone, you're in charge."
"Got it."
"Okay, well I've gotta go. Bye Win, bye Mr. Jones! Have a nice vacation!" Payton says before leaving.
I turn back to my dad. "Do you know where Quintin is?"
"He and Kyle took the kids out for ice cream, but Josh is here if you want company."
"Um, I'm good."
Mom walks into the kitchen with her bags. "Ready to leave Joe?"
"Ready. Let me get those bags for you sweetie."
"Bye Winnie. Be responsible." she says before they leave and drive away.
"Sooo," A voice says behind me. "Seems we have the whole house to ourselves."
Joshua.
Ugh. Shoot me now.
