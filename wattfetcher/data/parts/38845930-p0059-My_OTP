"You are the sweetest thing that has ever been created... I am in love with it." He said before kissing me.
"Yes." I said.
"Yes what?" He asked.
"I don't even know, the word just came out of my mouth." I said.
"Really?" He laughed.
"I don't know what that was... I think I was happy you said you were in love with me, that would be something I would be happy about." I said.
"I would hope so, I wouldn't want you getting mad I said that." He said picking me up by the waist and spinning me.
"Jordan? Where did that come from?" I asked.
"I don't know, you're just so cute." He said.
"Thank you, Jordan." I said.
"This is fun." He said leaning on me.
"Let's do this more often." I said.
"Yeah." He said.
We stayed until Boo was so tired that she fell asleep in our arms. Jordan carried her to the car where just before he put her into her seat, she held onto him "for dear life".
"Oh, Boo." He said hugging her looking at me like "aww, she's so cute".
"Boo, you gotta let go, sweetie." I said prying her arms from Jordan's neck. We were finally home after sitting in traffic for an hour and a half.
"Jordan!" I screamed after plopping on the couch.
"Yeah!? He asked from another room .
"Come here!" I said.
"What? What happened?" He asked.
"Nothing I just really want a hug." I said.
"Okay, hug time it is." He said.
