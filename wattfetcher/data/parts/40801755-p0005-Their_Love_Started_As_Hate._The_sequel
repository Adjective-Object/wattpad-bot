"It would take time but you would be better, it may still hurt, but at least you have someone better and someone who cares for you, someone who had took the time to be with you and Cheer you up, to hold you at night, to take you on dates that are out of this world," I sighed and wiped away a few tears, so did a couple of other girls and even Mrs Miller, "but that's just my point of view," "may I go to the toilet," Mrs Miller nodded

"Do you really feel like that?," Mark asked his eyes were glossy and a little red, I pushed him of me, "I don't want to talk right now," i whispered, he didn't reply.
