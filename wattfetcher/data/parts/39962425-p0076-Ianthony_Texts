A/N: HEY GUYS OMG BEFORE I GET TO THE SMALL Q AND A GAY MARRIAGE IS NOW LEGAL IN ALL 50 STATES WOOOOOOOOOOO!!! #LOVEWINS!! ok now to get to the Q and A!
Who is your favorite youtuber?I honestly have more than one favorite, but it would have to be a tie between: Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, AmazingPhil, Danisnotonfire, and Smosh ^-^
How did you find Smosh?
I was at a friend's house and we were watching her youtube subscriptions. Smosh's video with Rob Dyrdek played and I watched the bts too and I was laughing so much, so I asked her who they were. She told me Smosh and then somehow I remembered it and when I got home, i looked them up and watched their ouiji board video. (idfk why but Ian with his beard scared the shit out of me so I just kinda floated away from Smosh then I floated back and now I have watched almost all of their videos. New and old.)
Why did you start watching them?
They seemed extremely funny and shit so I just went to their channel and hit dat subscribe button.
How old are you?
I am 13... Not much else to say about this.. xD
What's your favorite song?At the moment it would probably be Game Over by Falling In Reverse, or possibly Photograph by Ed Sheeran.
What's your favorite band?
I have many, but if I had to choose one, I would have to choose Fall Out Boy because Patrick Stump jfc he's just so beautiful.
What's your favorite color?Black like my sooooouuuuuuuuulllllllllllll xD just kidding! I like blue, green, and black.
