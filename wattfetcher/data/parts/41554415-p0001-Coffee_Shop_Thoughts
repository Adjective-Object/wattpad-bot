Dear first love
I realize now there is nothing from above that could have sent you to me
I realize now that if anything you arose from the ground and only wanted to tear my heart out.
I realize now that you only wanted me for my body
I realize now you were just like a zombie. Yet you never did like my brain.
From the broken girl
