dearest noel,
some days i can manage just fine. keep it together and smile. but other days i can't, noel.
on those days i can't smile or fake my laugh anymore or pretend that everything is okay because it is not.
i completely break down. it feels like my heart has been ripped out of my chest a million times and shoved back in, each time to feel the pain worse once again.
it's like i'm completely drowning in this sea of darkness and nobody can save me.
but it's okay.
i don't want to be saved.
the voices are so much louder each day.
i'm scared that i may be losing my mind noel.
