I went outside only to see Ice waiting for me. This dude is really annoying me. Why does he have to be everywhere? He’s even haunting me in my dreams! I can’t believe how persistent he is.
“Chase! Where d’you wanna’ go?”
“Somewhere you’re not supposed to be concerned of.” I started walking, leaving him behind.
“Eh. I thought you want fastfood?” He started following me.
“Yes, I’m eating outside because I want to. Just go home already. Why are you even here?”
“Why can’t I be here? And besides, I wanna’ spend my weekends hanging out with you. What’s wrong with that?” He fixes his glasses while still following me.
“Ugh… I told you I’m not gay! And I won’t ever be.”
“It’s not even about that. I just wanna’ spend time with you.”
“Okay, okay. I give up.” Sigh. I really can’t keep up with his persistence. So annoying.
“Yay! So where d’you wanna’ go?”
“…”
“Oh! I know a place that serves really good food! Let’s go there!” He grabbed my hand and started dragging me towards the main road.
“W-wait!”
“Hurry, hurry!” He nagged while still holding my hand.
“Okay! Okay! Can you please let go of my hand already? This is getting awkward, you know?”
“But there’s nothing wrong with it. Bestfriends do that.”
“What? Girl friends do that but guys don’t!”
“Eh. Okay.” He finally lets go of my hand. “Let’s wait here.”
“…” I stayed silent while waiting for a cab to arrive. I don’t really wanna’ start a conversation with him. It’s just gonna’ end up bad anyway. I looked at him and he seems so happy. He has this wide smile that can really soothe anyone’s problems. I can’t help but smile as well.
“Finally, a cab!” He raised his hand to alert the taxi driver.
==========================================================
After just 10 minutes, we arrived at this coffee shop. It was small but it looked so cozy. It’s definitely a place where you can study without the fear of being distracted and disturbed. The glass door was designed with a hand-drawn “Welcome” sign. As I was about to enter the coffee shop, I accidentally knocked down one of the display gnomes near the door. Suddenly, I spaced out and weird things kept flowing into my mind.
“You always knock these things down. Be careful!”
“…”
“I get it. The inside looks really distracting. But these gnomes are really cute! Kicking them will make them sad.”
“Chase? Chase? Get inside. I’ll take care of this.”
“Oh… Oh, sorry. I’m such a klutz.” I finally snapped out of my strange daydream.
“I know you are.” He followed it up with a smile. “Just get inside so we can order right away.”
“O-okay.” I left Ice to fix the gnomes up and decided to sit at the farthest corner of the shop.
While waiting for Ice to finish, I can’t help but notice this one guy staring at me. He looks like he is studying me or something. It’s as if he has these bionic eyes that scan me if I have something to hide. I can’t help but chuckle at the idea.
