Whale den
Anyway it's not my fault I didn't finish my homework my language arts teacher for some reason thought it would be smart to give me, the person who can't concentrate or stay still... Homework
I had to write a two paragraph summary
I believe in quality not quantity
Like I was so tired I wrote two paragraphs that all together meant nothing
And than she wanted two paragraphs of out reaction to the story
Now u see, my reactions are usually one worded like,"Idiot." "Wow" "meh"
Not,"Yes and this made me feel _____ because blah blah blah and this reminds me of when _____"
I was reading an article where someone got shot
OF COURSE I HAVE SOMETHING I RELATE TO I MEAN MY SON GETS SHOT EVERYDAY *note sarcasm*
I don't even have a kid
WOOOOO IM LIKE THAT 5% (just made that percentage up) THAT DOESNT HAVE KIDS AT 13
