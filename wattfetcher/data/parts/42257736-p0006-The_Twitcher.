"Have you seen anyone that you like yet" she winked and looked over at Tyler who noticed her sly wink and blushed.
"Uh um...." I stuttered.
*twitch*
"Come on!" Paul groaned.
He was another guy in the group.
"There is this one person" I said quietly.
*twitch*
Bec seemed to notice my discomfort and she looked up from her phone.
"Guys don't force her to answer if she doesn't want to" Bec said.
I looked at her and silently thanked her.
*twitch*
"Okayyyyyy" Amelia laughed
The bell went so I checked my schedule and it said I had woodwork.
"Um does anyone have woodwork next?" I asked shyly
*twitch*
"I do!" Amelia squealed.
"Me too" Bec stated.
We all walked to woodwork and Amelia asked me tons of questions.
Bec just observed.
*twitch*
We arrived at a door with a small white 5 painted on the green door that was almost not green because of other colours covering it.
Amelia and I talked more before I saw that girl again.
She was walking with a guy that looked alot like Tyler except his hair was in a messy quiff and his skin was a little more tanned.
*twitch*
This guy was also more buff.
They stopped close to our classroom and he gave her a quick peck and walked off.
That's when it registered that she was in my class.
Holey f*ck.
*twitch*
Woodwork passed by easily.
We are making some sort of box so I just watched Amelia flirt with some guy and Bec hammer the life out of different peices of wood.
The bell went and I went to my last lesson which was P.E.
*face palms*
I hate P.E.
*insert physical exercise scene here*
Once the final bell had gone I practically bolted out of that locker room
*twitch*
Judgy b*tches.
After book club I walked home and found that both my Mum and Dad were home.
I walked in the door and smelt fresh cookies.
"I'm home!" I yelled out into the large house.
*twitch*
My mother rushed into the green living room where I was standing looking like the most stereotypical 50's mother you could imagine.
"Hello darling you missed dinner so I made you cookies instead" she laughed.
She was holding a cookie tray.
"Mmm cookies" I laughed.
I took a few cookies and walked up into my massive bedroom.
