"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?! WHY DID YOU COME HERE?! WHY HERE? WHY TO WHERE I LIVE?! IM NOT MOVING AGAIN SO I SWEAR TO GOD KAMDEL IF YOU SAY ANYTHING I WILL POUND YOU SO FAR INTO THE GROUND YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN!!"
"Damn girl you still got it good for me" she replies sarcastically but I didn't notice it at first so my hand went across her face then she looked at me and said "Wow."
"Yeah wow. I hate you very much and I wanna punch you in the face and then slap you silly." And she just looks shocked and I never thought I could be this mad.
"Sky it was a dare" Kam said
"No Kam. Making the whole school see me as a gay idiot was not a dare. Kissing me was. Just leave me alone. Don't bother me. And I better not hear any apologies because I'm not going to accept it so save your breath" I said as I walk inside my house slamming the door behind me and I thought to myself When did Crystal go inside? But I went to go back to listening to music when I remember what Crystal did to my phone so I went into her room and took $200 from her secret bank and then she screamed at me how she was saving that her whole life and all that stuff but I honestly didn't care. I just ignored her and went to bed. But I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about Kamdel.
