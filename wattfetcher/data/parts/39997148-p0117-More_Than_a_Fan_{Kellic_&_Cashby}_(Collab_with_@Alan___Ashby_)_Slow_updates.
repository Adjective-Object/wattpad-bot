"Yes it is."
"Well it's nothing. We're perfectly okay."
"No we're not!" Alan shouted from the back.
Phil smirked, "Guess that answered it, Alan get in here."
"No, I'm busy." He said.
"Get in here Alan! We can't have you two being all pissy and dramatic when we're supposed to be concentrating on this tour." Aaron said.
"This is why we told you not to get with him." Tino said quietly and smacking the back of my head.
I sighed, "I know, I know."
"Now you two will fucking fix whatever is happening right now." Phil said getting up and leaving the room soon coming back dragging Alan with him.
"Can we do this later? I need to finish my school work." He muttered crossing his arms.
"Too bad. We'll leave you two alone." Aaron said before all the guys left the room.
"This is stupid." Alan mumbled and sat down across from me.
"What's stupid? Talking about stuff together?"
"Whatever, what do we even have to talk about?"
"I don't know- you're the one who told them we have a problem."
"I didn't tell anyone we had a problem."
"When I said that we're perfectly fine you told them that we aren't therefore making them think we have a problem."
"Because we do have a problem Austin!"
"Then let's just talk about it!" I yelled getting annoyed.
"How can I try and talk about anything when all you've been doing is ignore me! God I feel like I'm back with Roy!"
"Well let's talk now then! And don't you dare compare me to some abusive asshole!"
"I've wanted to talk about this shit for like three days but you pretend like I don't exist!"
"Okay I get it! Let's talk about it!"
"I don't know if this is working Aust."
My heart stopped, "W-what do you mean it's not working?"
"We never have time together and I-I don't know my feelings for you right now."
"We-we can figure this out Alan, I just know it."
"I don't know anymore Austin."
"So yo-you want to break up?" I asked slowly.
"I-I think we need to."
"O-okay I guess it's- I guess we're over then." I said softly, "I'm just- I'm just gonna go." I told him standing up.
"Austin. I-I'm just- I'm confused right now. We never have t-time for e-each other and I-I need someone w-who is there." He said going to take my hand but stopped.
"Fine whatever, I hope whoever it is makes you happy." I mumbled and opened the door to the bus, "Just don't get hurt."
"I-I'm so sorry."
I didn't say anything as I walked out of the bus slamming the door shut behind me.  I walked into the venue where Pierce was doing sound check.  I sighed and leaned against the wall sinking to the floor just listening.
I can't believe we broke up.  I didn't want this. I really liked him and now it was over.
