Harry's POV

This couldn't be happening right now. Brock didn't take her. No, he didn't. It's just a figure of my imagination. My thoughts are running wild thinking about what he's going to do to her.
Lennon had to be so damn selfish and go out into the city. I specifically told her not to. It's way too dangerous especially with Brock. We just had to get into another argument. And then, once again, Zayn couldn't keep his own mouth shut.
I followed Lennon from behind in the city. Once I finally caught up to her, she saw me and ran. She ran to the most dangerous place possible, an alleyway. That is where my own damn step father took her.
So here I am, standing outside an abandoned warehouse which just happens to be Brock's hideout.
I quietly walk inside careful not to make any noise. Once I step through the door, I immediately hear a faint scream. My first instinct is to run to Lennon, save her, and beat the shit out of Brock. On the other hand, I could compromise with the prick.
As I walk further into the warehouse, the more nervous I get. My heart's beating rapidly. Hearing Lennon's agonizing screams makes me tremble.
Then I see her, naked, lying on a couch as Brock hovers over her. The toxic bile rises in my throat. I cannot bare to hold my anger in any longer as I lunge towards the asshole.
Lennon's POV
Tears rush down my, now hot, cheeks. The thought of possibly being raped by a man twenty years older than me is sickening. I cried and cried until there were no tears left to use.
"Oh! Boo hoo! Too bad Harry isn't here to save you, huh? Poor Lennon," Brock smirked, looking down on me. I shivered.
I should've listened to him. Harry was right, it is dangerous. I was so selfish then. Who knew that the person I despise most is my only hope right now.
"He'll come and beat your ass," I spit at him with the strength I have left. His hands squeeze my wrists harder and I scream in agony praying that someone will hear.
Brock begins to slide his pants down making me wince. This is it. This will be the end of me. I rather die then be in this situation.
I scream once more just incase, but Brock just laughs at me. My eyes shut close as I begin process what's about to happen.
Every painful thrust made more tears and screams release. I was completely weak at the moment. Suddenly I wish Harry would be here for once.
Brock begins to move in and out of me faster and harder every time I scream. Suddenly, my screams die down and everything in sight turns to black.
Harry's POV
My fist collides with Brock's cheek. I try to ignore the fact that he's fully naked right now. Lennon has blacked out underneath him which makes me even more pissed off.
I repeatedly punch the bastard until I pretty much break his jaw. I really don't care what happens to the worthless man I call my stepfather.
Brock lays unconscious on the floor and I pull out my phone. I immediately dial 911.
"911 what's your emergency," the voice says through the phone almost right away.
"My.. girlfriend got raped and she blacked out. I don't know what to do," I had lied about the girlfriend thing. She's not mine, but I didn't know what else to call her.
"Okay, I'll send an ambulance right away, sir. Can you give me your location?" the lady asks and I give her the address.
Within minutes I can hear sirens outside of the warehouse. I just hope she'll be okay.
Hello Everyone! So it's been a long ass time since I've updated and I'm sorry about that. It was a short and crappy chapter. The school year is coming to an end and I'm focusing on maintaining my grades at the moment. I promise during summer, I'll be updating about once a week minimum. Though, while your waiting, you can always check out my other two books. Just saying.
Vote!
