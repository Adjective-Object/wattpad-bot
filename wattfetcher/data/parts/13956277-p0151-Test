Assalamu alaykum, Ramadan kareem everyone, I know I haven't updated for so long and it's my fault but I promise I'll finish this story before Ramadan ends in shaa allah :)

We had spent hours thinking and planning in Simon's house and came up with a full plan that begins with sharing the headline of the story on his personal accounts in social media because he is "Hot and everybody knows and loves me so they will read everything I write" as he said.
"Salam, see you guys tomorrow" I hugged the girls then headed to the door, "What about me ?" Simon opened his arms for me but I looked at him from head to toe and left.
As I reached my house, my phone rang, It was Simon, "What do you want?" I asked as I took my shoes off, "Woah ! that's not the right tune to use while talking to your baby's father" I hung up the phone and screamed as loud as I could, Alhamdu lillah Karam was out.
.....
Islam had become known better in my school, thanks to Tom, Molly and me, I hoped that would cover the many bad things I had done. We had succeeded in transforming more than 50 student and 10 teachers into decent Muslims, and I had even seen Miley breaking up with Conor and wearing clothes that actually covers.
"But that's not enough" I told Molly and Tom, "What should we do then?" Tom took a bite from his sandwich, "We need to expand the region of our activities, we should head to the streets, shops and malls" I said, "But it's almost final's time, we barely have time to study" Molly sighed, "An hour a day won't effect. Are you in or nah ?" I raised an eyebrow and they nodded.
After school, I had brought some posters and books then headed to the streets with Tom and Molly, "Let's split up so we can cover a larger area" Tom suggested and we agreed.
As I was walking, I saw a fight between a mother and her daughter going on the doorsteps of their house, which ended up by the girl being kicked out, the girl was in her early 20's, she sat on the pavement with her hands covering her face and tears, I walked toward her slowly and sat beside her, "Hi" I said with a warm smile, the girl looked at me then continued crying, "Uh, I'm sorry for what happened" I sighed, "I'm getting really used to it, every time she gets drunk she stars a fight and kicks me out, I have no idea what to do" She sobbed, I put my palm on her back, " I'm not much of a problem-solver but I guess that this will help" I handed her a book about the change that Islam makes in your lifestyle and personality, "Thanks" She smiled then I left.
I had spoken to many people and shared many books hoping that they would read them, I met homeless people, sick people in hospitals and many girls in clothes shops beside the many guys who flirted with me and took the books just to make conversations with me, but at least they would read the books because ... I lied and told them that they would find my number in one of the pages, Astaghferullah, but that was the only way to get them to read the books.
I sat in a coffee shop, ordered a doughnut and a large cup of coffee after I had finished my job, "Hi" I looked up with a mouth full of doughnuts, I swallowed as I was looking at him "Seriously, did you put a tracker or a GPS in my hijaab or something ?" Simon chuckled, I took a sip from my coffee and waited for him to speak, "My heart led me to you" He smiled and put his hand on the right side of his chest, "You idiot, your heart is in the left side" We both chuckled, "Who said I was good in romance?" He chuckled, "You clearly aren't" I whispered to myself, "What are you here for?" I raised an eyebrow, "Won't you at least offer a bite?" He pointed at my doughnut, "No, I am disgusted by sharing foods" I stood up and ordered him one large doughnut, "I want a milkshake too" He smiled, "Ha ha ha, NO!" I gave him his doughnut then sat in my chair, "You may speak now" I took a pen and a notebook from my bag and started doing my homework, "You DO know that it's rude to be busy doing something while someone is talking to you" He seemed angry, "Yes I actually do" I chuckled and continued writing, "LOOK AT ME" He slammed the table with his large hands and I shivered, "What?" slammed the pen on the notebook, "When I saw you walking and giving away books and posters, I came up with a better idea beside sharing the story on the internet" He said, "Tell me what you got brainy" I gave him a suspicious look as I took a sip from my coffee, "We can do the same! Print some posters with the headline and a short explanation about the story along with a website that has the full story and share these posters everywhere, in malls, shops and we can stick them on any wall in any street with the hashtag #Savethegirls" I stared at him silently, "You didn't see that coming from me, did you?" He smirked at me, "Um, No, I actually did not *pause* hmmm, not bad at all" I smiled.
