"Yeah. We're going to the beach, remember?"
"Oh!. I totally forgot, you guys can go on without me. But Riley stays here" I replied
"What's wrong" He asked taking my bands in his
"I think I have a headache and my throat hurts"
"Do you need anything or....." He trailed off
"It's OK, its not like I'm dying or anything. Is Riley awake?" I'm pretty sure I'm not dying but damn, this headache sure makes me feel like I am
"Nope" Ross replied. A knock was heard at the door and when Ross said "come in" Riker, Sammi and Rocky walked in wrapped in blankets and holding pillows in their hands. Really. I think they look like zombies who haven't been eating enough brains. They walked over to us and practically threw themselves down on the bed
"What are you guys doing?" Ross asked looking confused
"We feel sick" Sammi replied while rubbing her eyes that look slightly red and puffy, but non-the less she still looks adorable as always
"So?" Ross asked
"So..we're staying here with Ariana"  Riker said making it look like it was the most obvious thing ever
"Why?" I asked him
" 'Cause we love you" Rocky replied,  answering my question
"OK then??" These people are just straight up...weird. Just...weird.
"Goodnight" Riker said while snuggling up to his pillow
"Dude it's like..10 am" Ross said while standing up from the bed
"So what?. I'm going to bed" Riker replied
"Well then...um...in that case, I'll be going" Ross said as he walked out of the room and closed the door
