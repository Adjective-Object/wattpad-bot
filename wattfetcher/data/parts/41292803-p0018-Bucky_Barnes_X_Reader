So as I near the end of my story I have a question. I know the last two chapters seem a tad rushed and I apologize. Would you like me to go back and make it less rushed?

When the story is done would you prefer a sequel ASAP or I can touch up and add details to this story? I would like to do both eventually but what would you prefer? I really hate how rushed those chapters seem. I ill have to fix that later. Please comment.
