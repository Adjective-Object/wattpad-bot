Ah. Good, well, tell them to head to the second floor, the lower hallway. We'll be waiting there. You need to be present, too. Got it?

Oh? Why do I need to be there? Don't they want to talk this out themselves?



Ah, well I am a bit intrigued as to what really happened between them...so I guess it'd be good if I go with them, too. I just hope it doesn't end up in a fight.



Looking up from my phone, I faced the others and spoke, "Guys, they said that they're at the lower hallway of the second floor."




They exchanged glances and then nodded. One by one, they began walking out the door. I walked across the room to fetch my bag, after placing the straps over my shoulders, I saw that almost all of them went ahead. France was the last one to walk out, turning to face me, he spoke, "Alright. We'll be back soon, jeune fille."



"Whoa, wait! I need to be there, too!" I exclaimed, approaching him.




The Frenchman shook his head and raised a hand, as if telling me to stop-which made me confused, so I did. "Non. You'll be staying here." he told me.


"W-What?! I can't. I need to be there with you guys! They even said so!" I said, feeling a little outraged.



France kept his stance. "All the more reason for us to keep you away from them. You're staying here, it's what the others and I agreed on. (Name), it's dangerous."



"And WHAT is so DANGEROUS about TALKING?!" I snapped, clenching my fists tightly.



What is he trying to say?! That I can't take whatever the outcome of their discussion will be? Aw hell no. If they're going to sort it out, then good. If they suddenly end up fighting, then that's fine with me. I saw it coming. It's not like I'll allow myself to get hurt! I'm smart enough to know that. I can handle it. It's the 1Ps and 2Ps, after all. I understand.
