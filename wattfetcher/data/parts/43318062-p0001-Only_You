His cries for help are flooding my ears, but I can't reply,i just stare, captive by my fears from the arid ground, dragging uselessly holding the bowels of my stomach, as if that would stop the bleeding, how could I've been so careless .. . in the blink of an eye the bullets and the fire had consumed his deteriorated body, escaping from his lips screams of rage and pain ... He died because of me.
Strong webbed claws grabbed my thighs from side to side, demanding my full attention, I could not help but let out a small moan, I was very lost in that dream.
- Don't worry Dawn just been a bad dream-even if he couldn't answer with words, I knew that he understood, he's sounds, facial actions and he's amber eyes said it all.
I took the liberty of closing my eyes again and scratch he's head  just in the angle angle he likes it, neither slow nor lazy starts emitting small grunts and wag he's head on my chest.
How did I end up living with a lizard ... thing ... giant human living in my apartment, the thought bothers me a bit and i finally decide to  look at the clock.
-5: 35 a.m ..... Shit ... oh fuck fuck fuck fuck !!!! - I wave my arms euphorically on the big and scaly body sleeping peacefully on me, so who needs a blanket.
-Dawn, move your fat ass !, I'm late, nnnnggggg- annoyed he grunts and whip he's muzzle on my chest pulling out the air from my lungs.
-Uff, if you keep this up You'll leave me flatter than I already am.... Dawwwwn ....could you move, please? -I groan finally giving up.
The bastard,very triumphant stands up and pulls my leg until he to throw me out of bed, even with all the darkness that impregnate the room I can clearly see his twinkling eyes and feel his mocking look ... He'll see ,today I'm not buying snapper.
I start walking to the other end of the small room, feeling with every step, cold water covering the ground, turn on the switch and look at him, frowning, well aware that he know why.
-You are sooo cleaning this mess- doen't not move - Dawn ... get up-
-One- Settles a bit on the bed.-
-two- Lifts his head and looks at me.
Two and a half ... AAAND...- quickly jumps out of bed and stand on with he's two legs, hunched, it was a small apartment, so he was always hunched over, becoming more evident his great size and strength that he could perform; sometimes I feel guilty for having him like this. With a small pool and the bathtub to cool off ,and a welter of blankets with mud .... TV ... and chew toys ... I wonder when will be the day he decides to break the wall, a result of boredom, and "play" with Mr. Trumble.
But still, I had plenty of money to save before making the big trip with him. Take him to the field, far away from the city, yes ... with a lake, with all the fish he can eat and all the space he want to go and stand up completely; may look like a crocodile ... mostly ... but it has so much in common with a human being, (a mystery unsolved) and having him locked up was not an option.
- Hey, Dawn, is Tuesday,i'll be arriving late tonight, you know the routine, now is working in the factory, then in the sewer and finally at the restaurant. So you better give me my goodbye kiss - it may sound absurd, but he's definition of a "goodbye kiss"consisted on putting his forehead with mine and gently brush his webbed hands on my cheeks.
Just like the day we met. The day I rescued him and brought him here. That was his gesture of gratitude.
