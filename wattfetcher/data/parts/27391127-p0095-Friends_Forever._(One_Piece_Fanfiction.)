"I'm not mad."
"Then make me purr."
"Purr?"
"Yeah, purr." She answered pointing to her neck. Haruka eyebrow twitched but he gave in the girl's request and she started to purr.
"Meow!"

For some weird reason, it seems that Shanks figured that it would be best to check n the rowdy kids. That and the fact he said, "Those kids only live once YOLO!" He visited the various villas and fixed the following problems:
Food shortage in Villa One.
Violence in in Villa 2
The mistreatment and harassment of Marco in Villa 3
And a bomb threat in Villa Five.
Not really wanting to see the case of Villa 4, Shanks went in anyway. Much to his surprise the situation was quite controllable if by controllable, one means that..
There was an attempted murder on Zoro and Ace, Law nearly suffocated, Aya was passed out on the floor, animal abuse and he didn't even know what to say about the Sakura case.
"Ah~ Comfy cushion." Sakura sighed as she slept on Haruka's lap.
"Sexual Harassment." Haruka replied.
"Let's leave it at such." Shanks said. He ordered the boys to make the girls sleep then g to bed themselves. Two of them went successfully and the other two did not.
Sakura wanted to play a game and Haruka had to electrocute the consciousness out f her and Law ..... well, with the help of Shanks had to strap Hancock onto the bed and use his devil fruit to get them out of the room.
Later during the night.
Darkness, that's all there was. Sakura tried her best to run away from it but the light only seemed to get farther and farther away. Memories of her life started flashing before her. When she was captured and the screams and the crying.
The screaming just wouldn't stop and Sakura fell onto the dark ground. In trying to get back up, she felt that familiar pain on her back again. It was hot and it burned and the countless burning sensational lashes that would follow.
"You will never be wanted you shitty creature."
"Why the world want someone as useless as you?"
"Stop it!" She cried, covering her ears. The lashes continued until familiar voices started t say.
"Worthless lizard."
"She can't even walk without falling, that useless shit bag."
"I've seen better."
"Minna, somebody, please help me." She cried, trying t block out the sounds. It was then that a sharp pain shot through her back and seemed to spilt in half, with the iron smell f blood present. The pain was then replaced the pain, of being foreverly marked un-
"Stop!" Sakura yelled, jumping from her sleep. She had anther nightmare. The bed sheet was wet and her face was drenched in sweat. She traced her finger down the middle of her back where the scar remained and coming to a familiar spot.
She decided to take a shower and replace the bed sheets. It was at that moment, a particular bag seemed to glow in the moonlight.
The next morning.....
