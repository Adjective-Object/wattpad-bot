I showed him all places i knew.
He seemed very interested, and he let me talk while he stared at me while we walked.
Then, when i was done it was getting late, the clouds were getting orange and the sky was getting in a yellow-orange tone. It was a beautiful view. Then he asked me:
"do you like this place?"
That question took me by surprise, i hesitated, did i really liked it? I hated that place, i didnt know if i could tell him but... Why lie? There wasnt point on lying "no, not at all" i said
"Why not?" he asked "you got very pretty buildings, beautiful sunsets and people seem nice... Well, except that boy at the store".
"Oh, well youre right about the sunsets and buildings but people here are mean, they got no heart, theyll tear you apart if the have the chance, so, why have all this sunsets and amazing buildings if people are shit? I just want to leave." i said.
He replied "Well, youre right... But um... Maybe if there was a person that motivated you to stay, would you stay?"
That made me think
"Of course i would" i said "but... Who? Who would like me? Who would love me? I mean, look at me, im shit" i didnt even know why i told him all of that.
"No youre not" he said "you are a really good person, youre the only person that hasnt looked at me as if i was an alien or something".
"Its because you look like a good person, but ill say it, your dressing style is different" i said.
It was true, he used very tight black jeans, brown boots, and his shirt was a little open. It was attractive, in some way.
"Well, thank you, i work on it a lot" he said laughing.
