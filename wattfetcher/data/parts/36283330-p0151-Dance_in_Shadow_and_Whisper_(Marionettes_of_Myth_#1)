He continued, lifting his gaze to a vent at the other end of the room. "He demanded fresh air, so we pipe it into the room. He also demanded a window, but unfortunately we can't expose him to the outside world. He'd be much too easily found. He almost understands that now."
"Mazin. Really?"
"Really, really." He considered every detail in my face before he said, "Take him."
I stammered over a few inarticulate sounds before I managed, "Take-what? Just pick it up?"
"Yes. Let's see what happens."
I wrung my hands. I wasn't sure how I felt about picking up something that Mazin referred to as a 'he', and I wasn't sure how I felt about 'let's see what happens'.
The sweat collected in my palms and along my face as I studied the tiny gold sword. If this was truly Ra, if this was the gold that had pulsed through Amon's veins, then touching it would be like touching Amon himself. I would reach across two-thousand years, across a handful of demon lifetimes, across eras and worlds and places I would never know, and I would connect my fingers with his flesh and blood.
Conscious of Mazin's eyes on me, I hesitated. I was afraid of what he was looking for. I was afraid of what I'd find.
I was afraid of what I wouldn't find.
The ten-thousand pounds of my arm lifted, my knuckles knocking together with a tremble. The closer my fingertips came to the gold, the more my flesh burned, as if I was reaching into a fire. I braced myself, ready for the searing heat of the sun.
But when I closed my fingers around the trinket, I grabbed nothing.
My hand passed right through it.
