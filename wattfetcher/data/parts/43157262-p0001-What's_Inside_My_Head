A Thursday Night In AugustMom, Allyson, and I Go to the boardwalkTo watch fireworks in the sky
There's a couple of rides Right by the beachMy sister and my momBoth want to ride on each
There it is!Big and bright"The Himalaya"Lights up the night
They go togetherSo I go alonePensive and ObservingAnd thinking about home
The ride then commences Everyone screams and cheers Then I realize that I Am not the only lonely one here
Across the ride on the other sideThere sits a fair boy my height With long black hair to his shoulders Staring out into the night
He wears a black jacket and shorts And a blank expression on his face His eyes almost remind meOf our favorite Severus Snape
He sits there; solemn and somberI feel like I've seen him somewhere In a dream or even the citySomehow I know he's there
He's the only other one aloneIn the entire ride We're the only onesNot cheering with pride
The ride comes to a closePeople hop off with joyBut I'm still searching For the other one alone; the boy
