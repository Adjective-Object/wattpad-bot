"It's not gross. It's amazing."
"It's gross, chocolate is the best." I told him pulling out my wallet.
"Not it's really not."
"Yeah it really is, strawberry is for nerds."
"Well I'm a nerd."
"A sexy nerd."
"You know it."
I just smiled and paid as the girl gave us each our ice cream.
"I could have paid you know." Kellin said as we started walking back to the venue.
"I took you on the date so shush."
"Alright, sorry but you spent so much on me." He said and I rolled my eyes.
"It's fine babe. I wanted to."
"Well I don't force you to."
"Kells chill out and eat your ice cream," I told him.
"I am."
"Good."
He smiled and went on eating his ice cream.
"So did you have fun? Like would you want to go on another date with me again or did it just suck completely?" I asked nervously.
"I had an amazing time baby, it was absolutely perfect. I mean I was actually kind of scared that you were going to take me to do something lame and boring like just eat lunch or something because we do that all the time but this was actually really fun so thank you."
"Oh thank god you liked it. I was so scared you'd think it was stupid."
"I loved it, now all you have to worry about is making the next date even better than this."
"Right and it will be." I said smiling.
"Good, now we need to hurry so you don't get yelled at for being late again and I really don't want them to be mad at me for being the reason you're late."
I nodded, "That would be good. Come on now."
We walked the rest of the way to the venue talking about our favorite parts from the science museum and how much fun we had or well mainly I listened to Kellin tell me how great science is and that he is going to totally rub it in Alan's face that he got to go to the planetarium and see the stars and planets and got to learn all kinds of shit about astronomy.
We were almost to the venue when Austin and Alan walked off their bus. Alan looked to be practically begging Austin to pay attention to him. Austin basically seemed to be ignoring him before he turned around said something Alan and walked into the venue.
"I wonder what's up with those two," Kellin said watching the couple.
"I don't know."
"Well I'm gonna ask Alan when they're done."
"Babe don't worry about it, it's none of our business," I told him.
"He's my best friend and I know how he gets when he's irritated or sad or something. I'm gonna talk to him."
"Alright well I think they're done talking so let's go."
"Come on then." He said and started dragging me to where Alan was now leaning against a wall.
"I'm starting to think you really like dragging me around." I mumbled.
"Its fun."
