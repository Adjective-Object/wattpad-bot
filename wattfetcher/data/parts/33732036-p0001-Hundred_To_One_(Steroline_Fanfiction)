Okay so a Steroline fanfiction!!!
I've always wanted to right one, but haven't really had good ideas :/ this one probably isn't much better, but I got some ideas so yeah. I don't own any characters, the only one I own is Caroline and Stefan's child. :) if you have been caught up with The Vampire Diaries then you'll understand this Fanfiction, if not then this may be a spoiler, especially if you're not up to episode 14 of season 6. Speaking of season 6, episode 14, this is where the fanfiction starts so yeah :D
I just find Steroline perfect and yeah they are so cute and all :) also you'll get daddy Damon, he'll be a father figure to the child which I think is adorable, I mean Stefan will be there, but Damon is like the amazing uncle who is just always there. Anyways I hope you enjoy this story as much as I will enjoy writing it and always read the authors note because I'll be asking questions and I might need help on something and the authors note is where that will be :D
Also please comment and vote, because I'll probably update when the story has gotten a certain number of each :)
Love you all, enjoy xxx NR
