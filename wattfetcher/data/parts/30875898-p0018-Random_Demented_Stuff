A/N-I don't know who made this, but whoever they are, they are amazing. All rights to the amazing person who came up with it.
She sat alone
Alone and at home
Where her screams were oh so silent
Yet her mind oh so violent
Her insecurities hid deep inside
And they did indeed eat her alive
A tear rolled down her face
As her heart began to race
She took her blade and tore her skin
Where her depression lied deep within
This went on for days months and even years
Until she cried her very last tear
She decided that she had enough
The world around her was much to tough
She took a gun to her head

This girl is dead
