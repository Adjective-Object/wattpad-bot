I sighed. Ever since Ally happened, the manager had every staff member sign a contract that forbids them from having any sort of relationship with us.. other than co-worker to idol relationship. I don't blame Hobie or Ally, it's for our safety. Man, but Hyun-mi is so beautiful! What if I get her fired? Then I'll be able to date her!
Jin: She seems like a sweet chick.
Jungkook: Very sweet~
-_- this maknae better stay outta my way.
J-Hope: Anyways.. let's get started on the routine, Tae, you still can't get the hip roll right.
V: What does it matter? I'm V!
Suga: Yeah, and I'm Suga. Wassup?
Jungkook: Jungkook! (Raises arms)
Jin: And I'm Jin!
Jimin: And I'm the most charming member, Jimin~
"Oh my god. Just play the music." I groaned.

-Hyun-mi POV-
Man my heart was pounding too hard I barely spoke. They are so fucking hot! I'm gonna be working with BTS ^^
"Hyun-mi? Are you okay? You're smiling rather excessively." The manager said.
"Oh..hehe..I'm sorry, I'm just very excited I'll be working with BTS. Those boys are so awesome."
He chuckled. "Yeah well, I'll remind you that you signed a contract.."
"I know...I'm forbidden to have any sort of relationship with them other than co-workers. I got it." I slightly pouted.
I know I'm not allowed to date them. All thanks to that bitch Ally -_-. I don't like her. It sucks that she ruined everything. How am I not supposed to confess my feelings for Namjoon?! Like hello, I finally can fulfill my dream and work with my ultimate bias but...I can't even try and pull a move on him. I sighed. If I meet Ally, I'm not being nice. I don't care.

-Ally POV-
Okay, triplets are at daycare, now on my way to my interview.
-phone rings-
Wonder who that could be?
"Hello?" I said.
"Hey baby."
"Oh hey! Did you get there on time?"
He sighed. "No..I was late again, and I got yelled at and shit..whatever."
I pouted. "I'm sorry baby... I told you to head on out.."
"I know. But I refused. It's hard taking care of three, I didn't want you to struggle."
I smiled. "It's okay, I'll be alright. Tomorrow leave straight to work okay?"
He chuckled. "Okay. By the way, I met our new dancer. Her names Hyun-mi."
"Oh really? Wow. That was fast, I'm glad you guys got a new dancer and all. Sorry again for quitting my job. But it was too much, being your wife and your stylist... Has the manager found a replacement? "
He sighed. "It's okay, as long as you're by my side. And no, no luck yet, but we have Jane anyways. Heh."
I smiled. "Well, I have to go now, I got an interview."
"Oh yeah, tell me how that goes. Future nurse~ it's a great job. You'll do great."
