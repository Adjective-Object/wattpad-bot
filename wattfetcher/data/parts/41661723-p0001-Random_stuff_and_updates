Ok so I was about to go outside when my dad told me to get my mom.
I got her and they went to she shed in the back.
It ended up that my dad almost stepped on a garden snake (no poison) and it came into the shed.
At that time we had no idea if it had poison or not so I stayed far away from it but I still could see the shed and what was going on.
My dad tried to get it out of the shed without getting near it and it failed miserably so we just locked the snake in the shed to die.
Was that a happy ending or what XD
