I woke up to warm hands shaking me."Ugh... Hazel... Let me sleep..." "Carter the plane ride is over- It's me Zia" My eyes flew open as I heard her sweet voice again."Zia? Oh I missed you so much... I had this crazy dream that the plane crashed, and I ended up in a ship with a girl named Hazel in hell and and-"
"Carter! Burn te Hydra now before it rejereates its head!" Hazel yelled. My eyes flew open. That was a dream, I really did crash and I really was in hell. "Hurry Carter!" I snap back into reality and quickly burned the hydra neck into the last stump. It fell to the stairs, lost balance and fell of the stairs. I fell unconsious because of heat, tiredness, pain and because of what i've just experinced.
