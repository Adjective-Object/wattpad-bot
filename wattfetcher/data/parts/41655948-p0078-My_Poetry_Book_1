The rain falls down around us but we don't mind. We dance in the rain as the darkness nears. You're magnetic. You draw me into the labyrinth of your mind, letting me see the constellations known as your thoughts. You see me for me, and I see you for you. I couldn't even begin to ask for more here.
Two pale silhouettes dancing through the rain soaked night like ghosts. We live off of a love that's so electric, so alive, so dazzling. You know how when you're at a carnival, and you're on one of the higher, scarier rides, and you get that exhilarating, breathtaking feeling? That's exactly the feeling you give me. And that's how one should feel their whole life.
Let's get into trouble together and paint the city; let's live at night not at day. The city may never sleep, like the colors inside my mind. I ache to see the night with you, all of it, from the stars to the rain on the pavement, lit up by the streetlights. There's something about such a lifestyle that grabs my attention, making me feel jittery inside.
I want to write poetry with you on a roof at 3 a.m. I want to talk about life and how we've gotten so far but it's never enough to satisfy. I want to talk about everything that's been locked inside our minds aching to be said. I want to talk about how the sky looks "so Tumblr" or how the internet makes us feel at home.
