All Things About Cassandra:
Cass is a 19-year old Youtuber with about 50,000 subs. She vlogs everyday and sometimes post a minecraft video. Sometimes fans can easily spot her by her brown and purple hair, but it's not like she sees them everyday. Her best friend Alexandra is really the only person she talks to besides her younger brother Elijah. Her parents don't agree with the whole youtube thing and say it is dangerous. She doesn't care. Live life to the fullest is her answer for everything.
