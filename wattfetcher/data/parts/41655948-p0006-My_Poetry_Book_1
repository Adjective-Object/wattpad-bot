The darkness has fallen outside
Giving me places I can hide-
Away from the relentless tide
Away from the pain that won't subside.
You light a cigarette.
'One step closer to being dead'
They said
But you couldn't get it through your head.
Sure there are lots of different symbolic resonances to smoking
But choking
On society's lies,
And looking for a way to die
Is not how we end this fight.
We may be wrong, we may be right
But by the end of tonight,
It doesn't even matter
As we fall asleep to the soft pitter-patter
Of the rain.
And we wouldn't want to be anyone else, we'll stay insane.
In your wake of cigarette smoke,
You leave behind the words you spoke.
And it's honestly breathtaking to me
As blue and beautiful as the sea,
Cold and crashing relentlessly
But you're only beautiful tragically.
