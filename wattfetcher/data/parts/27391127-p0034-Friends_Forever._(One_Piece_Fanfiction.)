"I'll become your slave!"Millie yelled bravely. The whole crowd was shocked and the royal family was speechless.

"That's my daughter." King Leo muttered smiling to himself. Already knowing his daughter's intentions.

"Papa, I'm going to make sure that these people never come back, so don't try to stop me okay?" His child said to him in a cheerful voice.

But the although the King was proud his mind was unstable. "That child is so naive. No one can bargain with a Celestial Dragon."

"Well, now that you've made up you-"

"Wait a minute!" Millie shouted. "If I become your slave. You must swear to never, ever come back to my island! And hurt my people or my family."

"If you follow through on t- *sniff* the- *sniff* these terms. I'll become your slave for life!"

"Is she.."
"Negotiating.."
"With a World Noble?"

"Fine. Guards!"

Both of the suited men pinned Twilight on the ground and another had the branding iron, already steaming from the extreme temperature.

"I'm a Celestial Dragon, I don't do negotiations with worthless creatures like you!" St.Marie stated.

"That's not fair, you promised!"
"Promised what?"


Millie was scared now. A drop of the smelted iron came into contact with her skin and that made the poor girl scream bloody hell.

Twilight tried hard to free herself but the guard's grip was too strong. Then the branding iron came into contact with her skin.

The pain.

Pain.

That's the only thing she thought of.

The pain.

Twilight screamed probably the loudest bloody hell in history. The pain was so intense that the poor girl passed out.

St.Maire then motioned to her brother that it was now time to go and they both walked to St.Maire's newly acquired s;ave.

She kicked her in her stomach, "Get up you little piece of shit." But Twilight didn't answer.
