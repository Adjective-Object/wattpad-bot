Will you still care,
When it's three in the morning
And I'm so anxious that I can barely breathe?
Will you still care,
When I'm covered in blood
And there's tears pouring down my cheeks?
Will you still care,
When I'm shutting you out
And I never explain to you why I left you alone?
Will you still care,
When I'm done being strong
And I find the relief I always wanted in those sharp razors,
Instead of your arms?
Will you still care?
