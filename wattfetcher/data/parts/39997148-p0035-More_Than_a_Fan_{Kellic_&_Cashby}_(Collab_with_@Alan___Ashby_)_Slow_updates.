"I'll think about it."
"Okay, okay I'll let you think about it."
"Okay, now where's the marshmallows?" He asked looking around the aisle, "Found them!"
"Great, how much do you think we should get?" I asked looking at all the packages, "And what kind should we even get?"
"Like three bags and the normal ones. Plus a bag of the jumbo marshmallows. So I guess four."
I looked at him, "Why so much?"
"Because so everyone can at least have one and then some people will want more than one." He said, "And the jumbo ones are just fun to have there to throw at people."
I chuckled, "Well then how about we just get all jumbo ones?" I asked and grabbed four bags of the jumbos throwing them into the basket.
"Fine, fine."
"Now we need graham crackers, chocolate, and stuff for hot dogs." I said, "Oh and we can go to a liquor shop after this to get that shit."
"Sounds good."
"Perfect." I said and we went on grabbing all of the supplies talking about random things along with me trying to talk him into going to the campfire. Once we finished at the grocery store Kellins stomach growled.
"How about we go get lunch then the liquor store?"
"Please?" He asked, "I'm starving."
"Anywhere you want to go?"
"Anywhere is fine."
I looked around, "How about Taco Bell?" I asked, "It's just across the street."
"Sounds good."
"Good."
We walked across the street with all the groceries as best as we could before reaching it. We set them down and he sat down sighing.
"What do you want? I'll go get it."
"Just get me a couple of burritos and a Dr, Pepper please?"
"Alright."
I went and ordered our lunch which we ate quickly and went straight to the liquor shop buying a shit ton of alcohol which had Kellin convinced that everyone there thought we were major alcoholics or something. And now we were in a taxi on our way back to the buses.
"Well that was fun."
"Yeah it was." I told him and it actually really was fun, more fun than I anticipated at least.
He smiled. "Really?"
"Yeah it was fun."
"Well maybe we could hang out more or something."
I smiled, "Yeah maybe we could."
The rest of the cab ride was quiet from there until we got back to the buses. We grabbed out the groceries and came back for the liquor bringing them on to the bus.
"We're back!" I shouted.
"Cool." Mike said not looking away from the video game he was playing with Tony.
"Did you guys have fun?" Tony asked.
"Yeah." Kellin said, "It was great."
Jaime smirked, "Well that's good. Did you guys get everything we needed?"
"Mhm." I said glaring at him, "We got the campfire crap and liquor."
