Greta had to do dishes tonight. So I helped her. She was washing, I was drying. "So Colton what do you think about my family so far?" Greta asked. "I like your brothers, your mom seems pretty cool. Your sister is okay. Oh and loooove your grandma." I said half of it being sarcastic. She smiled "Yeah my grandma is cooler than most."
We we're finishing up when I said "Hey Greta, I'm sorry about..." "Don't sweat it Colton. I did it to you, you did it to me. Now we're even." she stated. "No, but it wasn't on purpose. I really didn't mean to." I replied. She looked at me with big brown eyes. "I'm still sorry for walking in on you. At least I had underpants on." She said glumly.
We finally got done with dishes and headed for are rooms. "Greta come on." I nudged her towards my room. "Alright, but if you get out of place I'll call my grandma." she smiled. I love when she smiles.
We walk towards the bed and she jumped on it. I hopped in next to her. "Come 'er kid." I reached my arms out. She snuggled up close to me. We talked threw the night about what to do tomorrow, but I didn't care. As long as with her I would go anywhere.
