CLARISSA'S P.O.V.
After telling me what happened, I decided to be stubborn as he was being. "Okay, well I'm gonna go grab something to eat downstairs at the cafe, do you want anything?" Shelby asked. "No, thanks though!" I smiled. She smiled back and went to the cafe. I got another knock on my door and saw it was Gavin. "What?" I asked rudely. "Clarissa, I'm sorry, I should've never said anything like that to you earlier," I nodded. "What can I do to make it up to you?" Gavin said, giving me puppy eyes then looking down at the ground. "Kiss me." I whispered. Gavin's frown turned into a smile and his face lit up. "I'll gladly do that." I told him to come in and I closed the door behind him and he kissed me immediately after I shut the door. Between kisses, he said, "I'm sorry,". "Shut up," I said back to him. He just laughed and kissed me again. "Clarissa, I love you." Gavin said out of the blue. I was in shock but I was smiling. "I love you, too." I said back. It was Gavin's turn to smile big. "And even if you did take Sabian's side over mine, I'd still be in love with you." He whispered as if the world was listening. Then something happened. "Isaiah." I murmured. "What about him?" Gavin asked.
"He might've done it."
