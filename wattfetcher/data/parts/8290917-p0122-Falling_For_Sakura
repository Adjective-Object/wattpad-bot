"Who knows?" Ned said. "Here."
Sakura eyed the envelope in Ned's hand with confusion. "What's that?"
"Open it," he said.
Sakura put down her paintbrush and took the envelope. She opened it and took out some papers. She flicked through them and widened her eyes in surprise. "Ned!"
"Yes," he said. "It's your birth mother. You did ask me to help you find her, didn't you?"
"Well, yes, but I didn't expect you to go this far. I mean, you got her name and everything."
He laughed. "There isn't much I can't do for Sakura." He patted her head like he would his daughter.
"How did you do it? I mean, I've e-mailed so many people, but-"
"Now." Ned chuckled. "You were just a wee baby when your mother was here, leaving you there at the orphanage doorstep. I'll admit it was easy for me because I know a lot of people in this small town. Chasing up those women who used to work in the orphanage was a tad hard, and, mind you, they weren't very cooperative either."
"I see," Sakura murmured, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't believe it. Couldn't believe Ned had found out who her mother was. "Thank you so much, Ned."
Ned chuckled. "Now, don't you give me those distasteful big eyes. It's disgraceful."
Sakura chuckled, too. Ned always said that every time she was about to cry. But this time she wasn't about to cry because she was hurt. No, she was about to cry because she was happy. She was happy with gratitude.
"You're wonderful, Ned."
"Nope, I ain't wonderful. I'm awful. I should have found this out a long time ago."
Sakura read the name on the paper. It said Haruka Tanaka. Was that really her mother?
"Now then, what are you going to do about that?" he asked, watching her carefully.
Sakura put down the paper and stared at the half-finished painting. "I'm going to find her."
"It's all in there," Ned said. "She's here, in America. New York City, to be precise."
Sakura felt her heart quicken. "Here? In America? But I though she lived in Japan."
"It seems she's just moved. She's working for some Japanese fashion designer. They're opening another headquarters in New York. I heard they're opening a new store soon. Supposedly the guy she's working with is very famous in Japan."
"I see. That'd make things a lot easier, wouldn't it?" Sakura asked herself. "Yes. After the wedding."
Ned smiled. "You know, setting up that gallery for you isn't that easy either."
Sakura blinked and turned her attention to him. "Ned! You didn't!"
He chuckled. "Of course I didn't."
She sighed. "If you did, it'd be so much work and-"
"Didn't want to waste your talent."
"Ned!" Sakura was shocked. "You?"
"Yes, I did. Set up a gallery for you. Your paintings are all there, ready to sell. Got a sales assistant all set up at the shop, too."
"Oh, Ned." Sakura jumped up. "But rent in New York? It's so expensive."
"Ha-ha! Made a contract with one of your patrons, I did. He loves your work. Bought most of them online. He's some real estate tycoon of some sort."
