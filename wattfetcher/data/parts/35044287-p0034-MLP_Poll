Hey sorry this is not a chapter. I just wanted to say WOOOOOHOOOOO! I   just finished my first year of high school! So yes I was Freshman but I   ain't no more! Anyway so since it is summer I hopefully will be able to   update a lot more. But the reason I said hopefully is because I do   Marching Band over the summer which takes a lot of time! But I will   still be able to update a lot more! Stay Calm and be a Band Geek! Oh,   and in the video above since I'm a band geek that does Marching Band I   have our show from Last year if you would like to check it out. It's   called Pompeii! Flute_Player_1 out!
