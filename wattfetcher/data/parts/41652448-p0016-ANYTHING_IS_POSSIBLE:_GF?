Pacifica's P.O.V

i was sobbing. Then my dad came in. And he beat me up. I had a bruise on my arm and leg. Then when he left I started crying again. Then I heard a knock on the window. I saw an un familiar face. It was a girl. She had long dark wavy brown hair, wore a necklace with a blue gem, had a pink blouse and a blue skirt. I went to the window and realized she wasn't the only one there. i also saw Mabel and Dipper next to her, then on the other side of her there was a blonde girl with a red T and purple jeans. She had the same necklace but with a purple. Gem. She looked a bit like me but with clothes Wendy would wear. I opened the window and decided to let them in.

Pacifica: who are you?

I asked the girls with the gem necklaces.

Mackenzie: I'm Mackenzie and *point to Zoe* this is my best friend Zoe.

I looked over at Mabel and Dipper.

Pacifica: why were you guys at my window?

Mabel: we'll we heard sobbing and decided to come back to see what was happening.

Dipper: and we saw everything.

Mabel: how could your parents be so cruel?
