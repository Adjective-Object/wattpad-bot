"Oh God I hope not." He said. His eyes met mine and I smiled. "I didn't want to ask because I remembered what you said about it. So just forget I even started to ask."

"Ask about what?" I asked.

"You'll laugh." Johnny said. I stood and walked over to him. I sat down in his lap and laid my head on his shoulder.

"Please. I promise I won't." I said. Johnny smiled.

"Even after today, with that one broken promise, I still trust them. Funny what being in love makes you do." He said. "Alright. I was going to ask if you wanted to, were ready to, make sex with me tonight. But I already know your answer. So forget I even mentioned it." I sat in Johnny's lap contemplating. I could but then again there were risks and consequences. It was possible I could get pregnant. But it was also possible I couldn't. And I wanted to. But I swore I'd wait until I was married. I thought back to the dreams I used to have about Johnny. I now had the chance to make those dreams a reality. So what was I waiting for? Oh that's right. To stop being afraid of the unknown. So I told a risk.

"Yes."
