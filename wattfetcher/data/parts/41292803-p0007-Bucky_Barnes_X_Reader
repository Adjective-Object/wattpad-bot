Tell me my story again.

I recounted everything that Steve had told me about Bucky.

Bucky Barnes was a hero.... I began.

A few hours later, Bucky was asleep, but he kept a tight grip on my hand. Without meaning to, I dozed off.
I woke up and smiled. Someone was gently playing with my hair as I lay on my pillow.

Wait? Pillow?

I sat up quickly. I realized that I had fallen asleep on Bucky's chest, using it as a pillow.

Bucky I am so sorry.

He gently pulled me down again and continued playing with my hair. I sighed. If only I could stay this way forever. I slowly drifted off again.
