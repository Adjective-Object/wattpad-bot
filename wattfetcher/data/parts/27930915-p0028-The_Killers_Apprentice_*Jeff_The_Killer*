I wake up in my bed to the smell of breakfast once again. It's peaceful morning, it's really quiet, but I know Wyatt is awake and Jeff is cooking. I'm shocked they're getting along.

"LENA! IN HERE, NOW!" I hear Jeff's voice boom from the kitchen.

Nevermind then.

"Coming.." I groan as I try to de tangle myself from the sheets. Eventually I pull myself from the bed and pad down the hallway. As I enter the kitchen, I see Jeff and Wyatt covered in flour. Wyatt has a wide grin on his face. Jeff, however, has the opposite.

"FIX. IT." Jeff roars.

"W-what.. happened..." I look at the mess in the kitchen. Flour covers everything in the kitchen, dishes, counters, and Jeff and Wyatt.

"We were trying to make you breakfast in bed!" Wyatt beams smiling ear to ear. "Waffles!"

"FUCKING. WAFFLES." Jeff looks like he's about to explode.

"Hey! No swears!" Wyatt smacks him over the head with a spatula. I try my best to hold in laughter.

Jeff yells a bunch of profanity and storms out of the kitchen, leaving me with the mess. He can be so immature.

"You're such a baby!" I call to him, but I hear his bedroom door slam shut. I roll my eyes and help Wyatt down. "I have to clean up, can you go watch TV for a while?" I ask him.

"Yes ma'am!" He nods and runs over to the living room.

I sigh and walk over to Jeff's room. He's laying on his bed, getting flour everywhere.

"Where's cleaning supplies?" I ask him. He sits up and shakes his head. "I'll clean it, don't worry about it."

"Okay." I nod and start towards the door.
"Wait, stay." He says behind me. I turn and cross my arms. "What?" I ask, annoyed.

"Hey, what's your problem?" He asks, taken aback by my attitude.

"You don't have to be so mean to Wyatt," I cross my arms. "He's a little boy."

"Hey don't you fucking tell me how to behave in my own damn house, I didn't want him here!" He barks at me.

"We killed his mother!" I yell probably louder than I should have.

"Per your request! I did it for you! And to thank me you bring this headache of a human being into MY home!" He shouts. "He is not my problem! He's yours! And that was your decision!"

I remain silent. Jeff knocks a lamp off his nightstand. The bulb and the stone shatter on the floor as he screams some profanities. He walks over to his closet and takes out his knife and his white hoodie.
