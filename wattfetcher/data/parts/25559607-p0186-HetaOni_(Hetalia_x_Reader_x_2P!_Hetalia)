"I...


All this time, I wanted to be with you guys... All of me hurt, but I couldn't stop trying, and yet I couldn't find a way to make it stop, either...


But maybe I can tell you now? Actually, I wanted to be with you, too. I wanted to escape with all of you..." Italy admitted, his whole body now trembling.


Japan pat his friend's head, "Yes. So do I."


"Ve... Japan..." At that, Italy couldn't help but break down in tears.


Prussia raised his hands and exclaimed. "Ack! Japan, you made little Italy cry!"


"Prussia, this is a serious conversation..." Germany reprimanded his brother.


America gave a thumbs up. "Anyway! We'll all live and escape together! The last time you had to rely on that clock was literally the last time! Okay?"


"Yes, no objections." England agreed.


"There sure are a lot of things that still don't fit, though. Goddammit, I can't figure it out with the memories I got..." Romano thought frustratedly, running his hands through his hair.


"Romano, don't think too much about it." Spain said, placing an arm over the Southern Italian's shoulders, causing the latter to give a look of surprise.


Spain faced him and spoke, "Just think that the red stains on your clothes were only tomato juice. It couldn't have been anything else."


"... Fine. I'll ask them later. For now, I guess it's enough that we figured out this much. Besides, they're a little less troubled now." The olive-skinned Italian said.


Spain ruffled Romano's hair. "Good boy."


"Sh-shut up! Stop treating me like a kid!" the older Italian huffed in annoyance.

"Hey, listen...I want to help you guys. I can't tell you everything, but I'll guide you guys to the best of my capabilities."I told them shyly.
