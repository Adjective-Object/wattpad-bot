Mason's POV:

I was in school, with my friends. The clock was ticking, while everyone in class stares at it. I think in my mind saying "Come on 12:00pm, come fast!". The clock finally rang 12:00pm! Everyone ran outside the school, but the hallway was so crowded! Everyone liked me still, cause my mom was famous. Of course she's Ariana Grande, but I was so disturbed by crowds! Everyday I see paparazzi's EVERYWHERE, which makes me feel watched. I get home and I say to mom, "Hey mom!! School's out! It's summer!" "Mas-what are you doing." Mom said. I was dancing to the song "Dance" by Big Sean, aka my mom's boyfriend..or my dad, as I like to call him. Frankie said "Mason! Back from school?" "Yeah, It was boring" I respond. Mom says "Mason, Â do you even want to see how many notifications you even have on your phone?" "Oh my gosh. 10000?! Mom I should turn off my 4G. Noooo I want to watch my shows there" I say. It was because I was Ariana Grande's son. Being a famous person's son is hard! "Mom is being famous hard? It feels like it." I asked mom. "Yes honey, it is. But It's kind of fun. You get to meet fans. I get A LOT of birthday messages on my birthday, like you did." Mom said. The post I made on Twitter for my mom was "My mom is the bae in this house, I love her with all my heart. I love you mom, happy birthday." I tagged her, and put a picture of her. She was the first one to like. Then everyone else started retweeting, liking, favoriting, and commenting. But one problem. Someone started a fight with someone, so I replied "Umm why is there a fight about my mom sucks? she doesn't suck." I defended her, like she did when that bully Kayla bullied me.
