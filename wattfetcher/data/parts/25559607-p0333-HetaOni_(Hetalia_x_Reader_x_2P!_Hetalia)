As I finally got to the lower hallway, I saw an unimaginable sight.




I've expected that they would fight, but not as bloody and gruesome as this. But what surprised me the most was that....it was the 1Ps who were violently lashing out. The Second Players...were the ones with the fatal injuries.




The two parties were so busy fighting off each other, none of them even noticed my presence...or so I thought.




"(N-Name)....Haaa...you're..." Canada panted as he approached me, wiping a bit of blood off his cheek.



My eyes widened as I saw his bruised state. "Canada...what...what happened?"



"....The others...they...planned on taking down the Second Players before the Second Players take them down. It's their logic. Mad logic, I know. I'm not sure if it's because of their frustrations from being in this mansion...or..." Canada paused for a moment, wincing from pain.


I noticed the sleeve of his tan military uniform to have a red splotch spreading out. He was bleeding. "Canada...you're hurt...Don't move...just-just sit down here for now...I'll try to do something." I told him, letting him sit down on the floor and lean back on a wall.



"B-Be careful..." he told me before falling into unconsciousness. Thankfully, he was still breathing-raggedly, but still living.



I slowly made my way towards the bloody chaos in front of me. The 1Ps and 2Ps were lunging towards each other and exchanging attacks.



I made my way into one of the far ends of the hall at a good distance, where I can see all of them. Clearing my throat to get their attention, I spoke, "G-Guys, stop!"



As soon as they heard me, there was a silence that befell us.
