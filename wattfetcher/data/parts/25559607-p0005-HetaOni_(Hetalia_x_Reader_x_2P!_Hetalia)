Japan: G...Germany!
...Germany, where are the others?
CLACLACLACLACLACLACLAC **shaking**
========
"Gee. As much as I want to understand Germany in a time like this.. His change of character is a bit weird. Poor Doitsu." I said whilst munching on more food. ========
Japan: ...
You look...shaken.
========"No shit, Sherlock. .... I'm sorry, I just had to." I said before proceeding in the game. ========
Japan: I'll go get you something to drink.
Japan goes outside the room and heads towards the toilet area on the first floor.He checks out one of two taps.
Japan: The tap isn't working. I'll have to look for water somewhere else.
So he sees a toilet.
Japan: ...
Well... This IS water too.
...Let's not be so hasty.
So he checks the other tap again.
Japan: Maybe I can get water here?
Ah, thank God. It doesn't seem to be broken.
Obtained: Water?
He then goes back to Germany.
Japan: Germany, I brought you some water. Drink it, and try to calm down a little.
He then gives the water(?)
Japan: Here. It's not filtered water though...
...
Germany: Is that...really water?
J: Judging by it's colour...probably...
G: I see... Anyway, sorry for falling apart like that. I feel much better now thanks to you.
J:  That's good to hear. So, where are the others?
G: I'm...not sure. At any rate, we ran for our lives... And those two went in different directions... I think.
Sorry, just...give me a moment to pull myself together.
J: Alright. I'll go look for those two. Try to get some rest.
G: Sorry... Oh, by the way, I found this when I was running. Maybe it can be of some use to you?
Obtained: Key from Germany
Japan then goes down to the Library.
Used: Key.
Suddenly, some eerie music plays. And...the Thing is shown to be walking around. But like, screw you monster thing, this is a library. We should be checking out books, not you.
So, Japan then checks the library out and browses for books.
J: There's so many books here. If I weren't in such a hurry, I would definitely leaf through them.
...
Well... Just one won't do any harm, right?
Japan learns Dismissal.
He then spots an Onigiri on the table.
