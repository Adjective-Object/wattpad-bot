Why are all my favorite songs getting eliminated! How is this a bad song! This was the first song I heard for Rainbow Rocks so I'm really upset that it's out. But anyway if your one of the people that voted this song out then you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME
HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
SHINE LIKE RAINBOW.
Good luck to the nominees! Oh and also If in the comments you see me say 'Poll close' then that means any other votes after that won't count. And yes  some of these songs get out fast! Anyway have fun and once again good luck to the nominees!
