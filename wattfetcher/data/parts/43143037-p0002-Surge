"Okay so a Camreson can morph into whatever they want."I say he nods "Girls are you hungry."Tiffs mom yells from outside "No."Tiff yells back we look at Jax when someone bangs on our window, I open the blinds to see the Camreson I jump back and Jax pulls me over to him the window opens and I look at the Camreson I walk over and shut the window he opens it again, and I slide out he smiles at me and I kick him he falls back and I look at him he gets up and I push him into the tree I walk over to the window but he grabs me, I kick and fight but he holds me tight when Jax jumps out he grabs my hands and pulls me, I fall on him he looks at me and I get pulled off the Camreson turns me and looks at me "Your eyes are golden you are one."he says, I turn and grab head and flip him I walk over to Jax and someone flips me I land on my feet "Okay not nice."I say and I look at the Camreson he bends over and pulls a knife out he points it to Jax's heart I jump on him and he falls the knife slides on the ground and the Camreson looks at me I swallow "Time to die."he says placing both his hands around my neck I kick him and he falls over I look at Jax who holds the knife he looks at the Camreson and he jabs the knife in his stomach I get up and look at Jax he walks over to me.
I walk over to the window and climb in "Sorry had to do something."I say and Jax slides in behind me he shuts the window "There's more like him more people well creatures that want to kill us like Sove and Kimacs."he says I look at him and sit down "You just have to learn to control your eyes, and claws, and teeth."he says I look at him "We can help you."he adds "But I don't want to be this I want to be normal why did you do this why."I say and I storm out I walk out of the camper. And down the road, home that's where I'm going I look around and walk back my car I need that I run into Jax and he looks at me, I walk past him and back to the camper "Sorry guys I just got to go."I say grabbing my bag and getting in my car, I pull out and drive to the entrance when Jax stops me, I lock my doors and keep my windows up he looks at me I pull up and he jumps out of the way. I drive home and get out I run inside and my mom looks at me "I thought you were camping."she says "I got home sick."I say shutting the door I run upstairs and to my room.
