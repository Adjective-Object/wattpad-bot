Late night drug store visits
With one intent in mind
To find something
That had the same affect
As your many many lies
I've turned my teeth yellow
Made my mind mellow
Cleared out my veins
Had my eyes rain
But I have yet to find
Something more intoxicating
Than the sweetness of your voice
And the right in your wrong choice
