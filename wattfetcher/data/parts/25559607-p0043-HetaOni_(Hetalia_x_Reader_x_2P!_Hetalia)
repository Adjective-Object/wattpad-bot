"A sound?" Germany said, wanting an explanation.
Italy nodded. "The sound of a piano. It was only one note, though. I wonder what that was all about?"
Germany was still unsure of what happened. "The sound of a piano? Hm...We have this piece of paper now, so let's go back to England. Japan and the others will probably join us there if all goes well, too."
"Yeah. Let's go back to the piano room, then." Italy agreed.

Since the two groups' paths were done, I switched the screen to check up on how Canada was faring.

Piano Room...
Canada turned to the door, but I dashed out to the hall, so he went back to the thought he was pondering about.
"Um... What I was thinking about, again?" Canada said, tapping his fingers on the piano.
"First, the piano. God, America's always getting us into trouble.Why can't he be a little more considerate? I mean-" He stopped talking to himself when he heard the door suddenly open.
"Oh. _____ did you find what you were looking for? I haven't looked here yet. Also! I remember were told not to do anything alone, remember? So stay with me this time. We should also call England back here." He said.
Canada turned around and saw that it was actually Steve, that bloody gray monster.
"Whoa!!" He exclaimed in shock.
"Wh-wha-wha-wha--what?"
A menu appeared. It seems that I could choose his action. Well, this is interesting.
>Talk to it >Stand still>Pour maple syrup
Of course, I chose "Stand still."
The monster looks around the room.
Canada suddenly rambles in his thoughts. "Wh-wh-why did this have to happen just when I'm all alone?! Maybe the others were all killed? No, I can't think like that.
Wh-wh-wh-what am I going to do?
>Pretend to be a piano >Faint>Run like the wind!
H-huh? Is it even... seeing... me?
Canada then remembers what I told him.
" _____ said something about me being the piano, right? ...So...does that mean...I should pretend to be a piano?...What..."
He decided to do so and just stood still.
Fall over showilyTalk to it Pretend to be a piano!!
>>Pretend to be a piano!!
Canada then closed his eyes and said the following words repeatedly. "I am a piano... I am a piano... I am a piano...I am a piano... I am a piano... I am a piano.. I am a piano... I am a piano... I am a piano...I am a piano... I am a piano... I am a piano.."
He suddenly gets too worked up and loses energy. "I... Eh...This... Dis.. I... Azz..."
I...I can't see anything
...Anything but the dark...
After that, Canada collapsed.
