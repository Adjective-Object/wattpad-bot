"I know," I replied, still on cloud nine. "I leave in two days. I need you to come over tomorrow and help me pack. I have no idea what I'm supposed to wear for this type of thing," I confessed, while still sifting through the contents of the envelope.
"Nope. I'm coming over right now to pick you up because we're going shopping. No offense, but none of those dreaded jeans and t-shirts you wear are fit for a Burke Industries Intern."
"But I already have plenty of clothes," I protested. Unable to stop myself, I self-consciously tugged at the hem of my favorite green shirt. I didn't think it was that horrendous.
"Yeah, but you need to look all sexy and professional. None of those tatty old clothes in your wardrobe will make the cut. You don't even own a pair of heels!" Kate insisted. I could already hear her moving around on the other line.
I sighed. "Fine. When will you be here?"
"Give me five minutes."

Sure enough, Kate's white Range Rover pulled into my driveway five minutes later. I grabbed my wallet and stuffed it in the back pocket of my jean shorts before climbing into the front seat of the SUV.
Kate had both the air conditioning and radio blasting. While I was unfamiliar to the song playing, Kate seemed to know every word and sang at the top of her lungs while we drove to the mall. By the time we arrived, my ears were just about bleeding. Kate was good at many things, but singing wasn't one of her many talents. Sadly, I didn't have the heart to tell her that.
When we entered the mall, Kate immediately dragged me into the closest store. Everything in it was sleek and sexy. My nose was assaulted with a spicy perfume as I entered the threshold of the store. Kate seemed immune to the scent and carried on anyway.
I sighed. My day of torture had only just begun.
Time seemed to crawl. It wasn't until after the thirteenth store that I collapsed onto a bench by the food court. My feet were killing me and I knew that I would vomit if Kate made me try on another dress.
"Why do I even need to look fancy? Can't I just wear black slacks and a nice top? Who am I trying to impress?" I groaned while rubbing my temples. Other shopper around looked at me with sympathy swirling in their eyes. They knew my pain.
At my words, Kate gasped and shook her head. She got up and walked to the news stand She came back a second later with a magazine in her hands.
"Look at the cover," she handed me the magazine.
"So, Justin Bieber screwed-up again. What does this have to do with my internship?"
Kate huffed and pointed at something else on the cover. Following her gaze, my eyes met the picture of a stunningly handsome young-man dressed in a tuxedo. BelowÂ the picture was the caption;
Heir to Multi- Billion Dollar Company Breaks Up With Girlfriend
"So?" I asked.
"God, Piper, you are so clueless! That's Chance Burke, as in Burke Industries."
"Well damn..." I let out a low whistle. I definitely didn't want to look like a bum in front of him.
"Yeah, quit drooling. We still have to hit up the cosmetics stores." Kate grabbed my hand and started dragging me towards Sephora.
I just sighed and followed her. My mind was too occupied by Chance Burke to come up with any excuses.
