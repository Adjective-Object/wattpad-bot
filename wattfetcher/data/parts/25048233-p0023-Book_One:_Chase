"Wow!" I exclaimed. "This is so cool!"
"I know. That's why we bought it," Pa bragged.
"Your Pa really wants it so I agreed on buying the entire set. I'm not sure on where to place it though," my supportive mother added.
"Well... You can place it on my room. Heh," I suggested.
"Don't be hogging everything. This is supposed to be family stuff," Mel disagreed but seconds later, she smiled. "On a second thought, we can place it on your room so that you get to have no privacy!"
"..." I had nothing to counter that. "Mel, how do you think of these things? It's like you were born to annoy me."
"I know right?"
"Stop it you guys. We're going to place it at the living room."
"But Ma, where will you place the old TV set?"
"We're going to have Ching take care of it." My smile suddenly grew wide. You have no idea how pissed Mel was at the idea.
"Ma! It will distract him from his studies. He doesn't need it."
"Mel, I'm sure he needs it more than you." Ma gave Mel a pretty unusual wink.
"Oh! Okay, you can have it Ching."
"Wait wait wait. What is going on here? Ma, why are you giving Mel a weird wink?"
"Nothing. I just had something in my eye, that's all."
"Hey. Will you guys stop chatting and start working?" Pa interrupted.
"Hmm. Okay," I agreed. I'm sure there's something going on with that wink. Never mind.
==========================================================
The new TV set looked stunning! It had four different speakers with it that can actually produce that "surround sound" the theaters bring to their viewers. The LCD TV was huge! Our old TV, which is in my room now by the way, looked microscopic compared to this. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating.
I decided to move on from my amazed state and went to my room while Mel tried the new TV out. I checked my phone only to see a message from an unknown number. Hmm, who's this stranger?
I opened the message and it read:
"Hey Chase! I'll be waiting for you here at Siam Paragon. I'm at Moone. Please come. <3"
"Hmm." I checked the time when the message was sent. It was sent five hours ago, 2:03 PM to be exact. "Whoever this girl is – I'm pretty sure she already left. It's been five hours since she messaged me so..." I wasn't able to finish my monologue because another message came up – and this time, it's from Ice.
"Ching! Thanks for the date. It really meant so much to me. See you at school next week!"
"I'm not replying." I should stop tolerating this. "Things are going to get messy if this goes any further."
I deleted Ice's message to stop myself from thinking about what happened earlier. "I should find a distraction." I opened the stranger's message again and smiled. "This might distract me for a while."
==========================================================
"This girl must be a "sweet lover" since she chose a dessert shop to meet me." I smiled at my poorly made joke. "I'm pretty sure she already left but whatever..."
