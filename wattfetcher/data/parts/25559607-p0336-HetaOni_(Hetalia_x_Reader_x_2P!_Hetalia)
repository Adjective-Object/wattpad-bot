Curiousity was overflowing within me.




Giving in to it, I decided to cautiously open the sack.




"R-RAGAZZA! DON'T! DON'T OPEN THAT!" I heard Luciano practically scream out.





But he was too late.




I was able to open the sack.... and slowly....it revealed....











A lifeless body of a girl that had (h/l) (h/c) coloured hair.






Trembling, I turned the body around to see its face. When I did, I felt my heart stop.








"N-No...No.... This isn't...." I started to mutter to myself frantically, my breath starting to grow heavy.




Luciano suddenly grabbed my arm and made me face him. "Ragazza-Don't! It's not-"










Without thinking I slapped him.
