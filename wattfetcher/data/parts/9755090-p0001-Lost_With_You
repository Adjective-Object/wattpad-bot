Kara Thompson is a somewhat abnormal teenager. Since her mom and dad's break up she has taken on a little bit of a badass role. When her father invites her on a road trip to the mountains, she thinks that everything will be just right for once, that is until her dad decides to invite the annoying yet hot, badass kid down the block.
Zander Morgan is the bad kid of the town and doesn't like when someone tries to steal his reputation which is exactly what Kara is doing in his eyes. He agrees to go on the camping trip only to tell her not to cross over on his turf and if she does, that their will be repercussions.
When the happy duo get lost on what was supposed to be a short hike to knock out their troubles, everything erupts with the two opposite forces colliding and both wanting to be on top. Dealing with being lost with an ignorant hottie and trying to find their way out of the expanding forest troubles seem to keep coming.
But beneath all of the dominance something evolves that will shock both Kara and Zander. They both know one thing's for sure; they will not return to the campsite unscathed.
