She was obedient and she died of cancer when I was 9. We later moved, we postponed the move so she could die with her entire family. I had her sense before I was born, she just showed up on my parents doorstep one day. I believe she was sent to look over us. She was sweet-this getting her name-, obedient, playfully and the best companion anyone could have. She truly was an angel. Even though we knew where she came from, they had seen the father-a boxer- roaming around or something like that. Second Animal- Jade is a golden lab and retriever mix, we got her at Walmart. He was the last puppy so we took her home, me and my two brothers took turns holding her. He was for my mom so she named her jade. She was so mischevious and love love LOVED sweetie...the where like mother and daughter~Third Animal- hermit crab..he/he-I never really knew- died while I was at school.
