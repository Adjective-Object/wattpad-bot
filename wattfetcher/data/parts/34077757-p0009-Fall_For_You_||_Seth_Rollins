Dani's Pov👸🏾💋      I am finally going on a date with Seth!!!! Well, Dean set it up it was so nice of him to do that. But now I have a problem.
Dean wants me to set him up with.....Paige. But Paige has a boyfriend already. And she isn't here today.
I hate that I can't return the favor, I think I'm just gonna have to tell her how Dean feels.
Anyways, I have to go see what Stephanie and Triple H wants. They told me to me them in their office before the show.
When I arrived I knocked on the door and waited about 2 seconds and the  door open...and now I'm standing face to face with Kane. He is just staring at me.
"Can I please see Steph and Hunter."                  "Come in." he said calmly.
When I walked in I saw all of the members of the authority. That included Seth (BAË af) , J&J , Kane (of course) , and my Bosses.
"You guys wanted to see me?"    "Yes. We did. Please , have a seat." Steph said
I took a seat next to Seth. He smiled a cheeky grin (Cheeky ass Seth). I smiled back . Then I earned a glare from the short men in the room. What's their problem. They can't reach the bathroom sink.
"Dani. We invited  you here to ask you one question." Hunter said taking me away from my thoughts. "And that is...?" I said questionably.
"Would you like to join the authority!?"
