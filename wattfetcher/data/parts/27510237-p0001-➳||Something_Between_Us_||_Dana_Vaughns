"Good morning, beautiful!" Dana said excitedly as you rolled over to face him. You were both entangled in the blankets together in the events from the past couple days, but you needed to be closer. Dana saw you struggling to move closer, so he took a hold of your waist and pulled you on top of him. You giggled, kissing his nose.
"Superman, Oh superman, how can you be so strong?"You sung, laughing in between words. Dana laughed, giving you a light kiss.
"Because. Superman is in love, and love is the strongest power of all." You blushed, punching him lightly in the arm;
"Such a dork, Dana." You said to him with a smirk.
He stood up, you attached to him like a koala; and he held you tightly as you both descended down the stairs. He placed you on the kitchen counter, then walked to the fridge to grab the milk. He stood in front of you, drinking the milk straight of the carton; which he knew you hated. You raised an eyebrow, and crossed your arms.
"You're so lucky I love you, Dana." You said, cracking a small smile. He put the carton down, and pulled the back of your knee up and put the other on your back.
"I know. You can't resist me." He smirked.
