"Princess Twilight, where are we going to stay?"
"Is the ceremony cancelled?"

"No, its not cancelled. It will continue as soon as the students give the word that it safe." Twilight tried her best to explain.

"You're placing you trust in weird students from that Grandline Academy?"
"I am!"

"Because they helped me before and I believe in them, they're not the type of people who just attack me just so!"

"You need to get out of here your highness." A guard said.

"No, bring the guests to the castle. I will stay here and wait for them." Millie commanded.

"Sayo-nee, Gemi-nii, I want you two to call the marines just in case something bad happens."

"There's no need." Doflamingo answered,clearly over-towering the princess.

"Doflamingo, get your fucking pink ass away from the Princess."
"Don't make fun of the colour pink."

"Oh,so they finally showed up." Doflamingo said grinning a big lot.

"Aya-chan, Sakura-chan! Haruka-senpai!"

"Oh, Aya's here." Doflamingo said sadistically.  Aya's once vibrant self immediately began to get weaker.

"nani? What are you doing here?" Aya asked. Her eyes were spaced out and her legs were trembling.


"Well then. Shall I tell them your little secret?"

Hello minns. Again.

Doflamingo: *reads intro* I take that as an offence.
Me: Oh, Doffy-chan, you're here! I didn't know! *gives give hard slaps on the back otherwise known as bless*

Doflamingo: *Grabs Sakura's hand* That hurt you know.
Me: *almost starts crying* Ace, help.

*Ace appears*

Ace: Yo. What's wrong?. *Ace looks and see Doflamingo holding both of Sakura's hands above her head*
