"Really?" I asked curiously.
"No," he said hysterically, "I really don't care how you feel. Either way, you are going to work for me again."
"I do not work for anyone!" I shouted. A few heads turned, but then went back to their normal routine.
"Fine," he shook his head, "Just don't expect to see that little prick of yours anymore."

As I headed to my next destination, Brock's last words kept repeating in my mind and so did a million questions. What would he do to Harry? Will he actually do what he's saying? Can Harry defend himself?
Brock is capable of anything, I know. And he can get anyone to do something for him, even if it's over the top like murder. He rarely likes to do the dirty work himself. It makes me shudder just thinking about what he could do.
Then again, Harry is strong and can easily protect himself. I mean, he beat up Brock last week. There's no doubt he could do it again.
I stepped into the warm building and the scent of hot caffeine filled my lungs. When I was waiting to get my application, I noticed a familiar blonde haired girl sitting in the corner with some guy. Probably her boyfriend, I can tell by the way they look at each other.
Once I reached the counter, I was greeted by a cute, friendly man. He gave me my paperwork and, by surprise, a free pumpkin latte. I sat down in a comfortable chair and filled out the form. Ever so often, I look up at the same couple I noticed earlier. I still can't put my finger on who that girl is and it's bothering me.
I handed in the papers back to the man who served me a little bit ago. He gave a small smile and I did the same.
Just as I was about to leave, I looked back at the familiar girl. It would bother me if I didn't find out. So, I walked over to their table and smiled.
"Hi, may I help you?" the guy politely  spoke and the girl looked scared like she knew who I was as well, but she didn't want to say anything.
All the memories came back. I was beginning to picture her in scenarios in my past life. How could it be her? I thought she..
"Fawn?" I shakily asked.
Woah.. wait.. Isn't Fawn dead though?! Lol. Um.. I don't know. (;
Sorry for the short chapter, but that cliff hanger though. There will be a few shocking things you'll learn in the next few chapters. Oh no!
