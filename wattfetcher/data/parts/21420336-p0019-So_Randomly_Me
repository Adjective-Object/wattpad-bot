So I come to my moms house and find a beautiful jar of Nutella on my counter.
I run to it grab it and hugs it as I run quickly to my room.
2 of my sisters and their friend chased me.
My sisters friend took my phone so she could get the Nutella.
Rule number 1:
There is a GODAM reason it's called MY phone because it's MINE NO ONE is allowed to touch it.
Rule number 2:
NUTELLA IS LIFE, YOU MUST KILL FOR IT.
So I snatched the phone away and she wouldn't let go. I started kicking and yelled,
"GET THE **** OFF ME!! DO U WANNA DIE!! GIVE ME MY PHONE!!! **** OFF GOSH!!!"
And other things I won't put here.
Basically I tackled a fourth grader.
I regret nothing.
(Btw I'm still clutching on to my Nutella like my life depended on it, cuz it does )
