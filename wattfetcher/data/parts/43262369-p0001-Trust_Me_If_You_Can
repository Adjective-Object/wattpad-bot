"Stacy do I ever say that I love you?" He says. I look over to see blue eyes, dark messy hair, and a bright smile. "Yes many times" I replay to my boyfriend Jake. "Ok well I gotta go and meet my boss for the promotion!" He says happily. I smile and he leaves with a kiss on the cheek.
I get up and decide it's time to start my day. I drag my body off of the bed and into the bathroom. I look at myself in the mirror and make a silly face. All I see is light brown eyes, brown hair, and a tan but not to tan body. "I look so...so ugly" I get my toothbrush and brush my teeth. I brush my hair for about 10 minutes seance I have long thick hair.
I go downstairs and make myself some eggs and toast. I eat my food quickly wanting to get to work on time. I finish my food and go back upstairs to put on my clothes for work. I put on a black shirt, black skinny pants, and my black converse. I put my hair in a pony tale while putting on some eye liner and a little red lipstick.
I look at the clock saying '6:30' I rush downstairs grabbing my lunch and keys and rush out the door into my car. I start the car as fast as I could and headed for my work.
