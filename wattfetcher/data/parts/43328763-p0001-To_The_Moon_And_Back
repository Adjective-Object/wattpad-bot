➳ I'm just a normal 13 year old.Hang on. No. No I'm not normal I'm not close. I'm me. I can be weird. But weird is fun right? Okay, yes I know my music taste is off but hey, that's all about being me. Yup that's right I'm that girl that you see in a MCR T-shirt and also wearing camo Vans. But at least I'm not boring. I try not to be at least. That reminds me of a quote. It's by David Bowie. It's also one of my favorite quotes.
"I don't know where I'm going from here but, I promise it won't be boring." ~David Bowie
To me that is one of the most true quotes about me and my life. I try to keep everything less boring. It can make life seem a bit more better. Just be yourself that's all.
My father is Eddie Smith. My dad is 41 years old. He has brown and red hair.
I have medium brown and red and blonde highlights. It's thick so hard to keep up with a lot.
I like green. And video games too but also reading and music is my life forever. I have weird taste but good taste. I will be listen to country one minute and metal the next. And everything else as well.
I love my family. Or what it was.
