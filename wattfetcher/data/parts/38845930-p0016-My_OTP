Erin's POV
Me and Jordan were tweeted a picture of us kissing, and since it was public everyone saw.
"Jordan! Jordan! Jordan look, Jordan!" I screamed as I ran from my front door to his car where he was waiting for me, holding my phone up in the air facing him.
"What? What?" He asked almost sounding as if he thought someone was dead.
Mascara running down my face, my breath quick and rushed, my eyes bloodshot red from crying for over an hour, I told Jordan that we were seen kissing and everyone knows now.
"Oh my god. Erin, Are you okay?" He asked totally disregarding everything I just said or showed him.
"Did you even hear me?" I asked.
"What? Yes, yes everyone knows. Are you okay?" He asked again.
"Shut up about me! Everyone knows and we weren't the ones to tell them." I screamed angrily while pacing back and forth.
"Do you want to post the video now?" He asked while tucking some hair behind my ear.
"I -- we have too." I said.
"Who tweeted it?" He asked.
"Stop asking questions does it matter?" I asked.
"Yes it matters." He said.
"How does that matter? We have to take it down!" I screamed before bursting into tears in Jordan's chest.
"Baby!?" He screamed as he grabbed my shaking body.
"Jordan!" I screamed into his practically already tear soaked shirt.
--and cue the actual tears--
"No no no, it's okay, Erin. Stop, it's fine, baby. We'll take it down and whoever knows knows, okay? You're fine, we're fine." He said.
"No! Why did -- did this have -- have to happ -- happen!?" I asked.
"Oh, stop. You have too breathe, Erin." He said.
Jordan's POV
Erin soaked my shirt in tears after finding out the majority of our viewers know we're together.
"Keep breathing and you'll stop crying." I said.
"No I w -- won't, Jordan!" She cried into my shoulder.
