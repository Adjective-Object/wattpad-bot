I slipped out of my chef jacket andj folded it up.  I shoved it in my duffel bag and said goodbye to my co-workers.
It was cold out side but my car was in front of me in seconds.  The valet here was pretty good.
"Thanks John."  I say and take my keys from him.
I am a masterchef.  I won the masterchef challenge thing with Chef Gordon Ramsey.  It was hard, but I did it.  Now I have my own restaurant in Vegas.
It's amazing.  I love it.  I love what happened to my life after high school.  It turned out amazing.
My dad died when I was a teenager and cooking was our favorite thing to do together.
I drive home and walk inside.  Most people want to come to my house for an amazing meal, cooked by me.  All I have in my apartment is wine, onions, and some prepackaged pasta.

"Gabby!  Table seven wants to see you!"
"Okay!"  I say.  I dry my hands and walk into the restaurant.
I walk to table seven and smile.
"Hi.  I'm Gabby.  I'm the head chef."  I smile.
"Gabby?"  The guy says.
"Yes.  I am."
"Ansel?  Do you know her?"  The girl asks.
"No.  We just wanted to compliment the chef."  Ansel says.
"Well thank you."  I smile and walk back into the kitchen.
The guy looked familiar, so did the name.  But he obviously wasn't important if I didn't know him.
"Add more salt."  I said tasting someone's recipe.  "And a touch of garlic."
"Okay."  They said and went back to their station.
"Gabby, someone is here to see you."
"Thanks Troy."  I say and follow him out to the restaurant.  Sitting at a table is Chef Ramsey.
"Gabby!"  He says standing up.  His accent was probably the coolest thing in the world.
"Chef!"  I smiled and hugged him.
"I'm very impressed with what you've been up to."
"Thank you Chef."
"Now get back to work."
"Yes chef."  I smile and slightly bow.  I head back to the kitchen and prepare meals.
