Ashly's point of view You can't dwell on the past is what they say well I believe that would be wrong to say that" most of my friends don't like me anymore I'm okay with that..the thing is I just don't like talking to people hell I never talk to my family I just sit on my bed staring out my window out into the ocean I never really put thought of why I do this but I just do I like it better at night there's no people and there's a cool breeze that comes once and a while I guess you could say I was depressed...I rubbed my head and sighed I looked at my clock it was 10 at night i got up and sat on my couch that was against the window I stood on my knees and turned backwards to open the window it was a bit jammed but I got it" I laid on the couch and picked up my TV remote and put it on Netflix I didn't feel like watching anything animated or humorous so I put on finders keepers and waited for it to load. I find it interesting why you don't get scared of these sorts of things I actually find it kind of humorous..so I guess I was kinda violent as well as depressed I was rather drowsy in the middle of watching the movie a few times I find myself closing my eyes. I figured that I was going to fall asleep soon I shut off my tv I didn't bother to go back to my bed the couch was the Ex Act same comfort I rolled over facing the window and fell asleep. Time Skip I woke up by a large crash coming outside I got up and yelled to see if it was my mom or dad they didn't answer damn it they must be out some where I got up and sat on my bed and put my headphones on and put it to full volume and waited for whatever to happen next.
