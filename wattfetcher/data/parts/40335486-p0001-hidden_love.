"I ship you with... Nathan!"
"Who's Nathan?"
"Nathan!"
He turned his head and walked over to the table with his shoulder's slumped. I looked at Nathan. He was cute, I guess. he had a weird color of hair, it was like brown with a small tiny of orange or red. It was spiked up in the front too. He was tall and skinny and looked athletic.
"What?"
"I ship you with Maya."
He started blushing and walked away.
The next couple days that's all everyone talked about. Nathan and I. Together. Like it would be the cutest thing in the world.
Our two friend groups pushed us together.
"OTP!" They shouted.
"Guys stop," Nathan and I said sheepishly.
It went on like this, but not for long until Nathan spoke up.
"I would never date her because I'm way better looking," he said.
Everyone looked at Nathan and I with wide eyes. I stood there with crossed arms.
I scoffed. "Yeah you are right... for a girl."
Nathan glared at me with cold eyes. I smirked and walked off.
