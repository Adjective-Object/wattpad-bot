"It's not even damage, just a bit red and I didn't bring any money."
"Then whats in your bag?" He raised an eyebrow.
"My phone."
"Really?"
"Okay fine, but I'm giving the money to you and your buying it because I haven't actually been to the movies before."
He looked at me shocked but then focused bac on the road.
"Seriously?"
I nodded.
"Wow, well, I'm honoured that your first time going to the cinema is with me."
"Yeah, yeah," I rolled my eyes, "I saw this movie that was advertising in the mall that looked really good, it's called the best of me, let's watch that."
He looked away and I thought I heard him groan a bit under his breath.
"You don't want to watch it?" I asked.
He looked back.
"No, no, I do, I always wanted to see that movie, and after we can go shopping," his smile was big that it almost seemed fake.
"Do you really want to go shopping?"
"Yes, I love shopping," he said shaking his head a bit.
I looked away, trying to hide my laughter.
