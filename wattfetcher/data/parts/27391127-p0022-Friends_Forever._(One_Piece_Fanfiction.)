Just for you dear readers to know. The Princess' name is Milliefiore E. Twilight. Since our characters will be calling her Millie-chan, I may use Millie every now and then.

By the time Haruka woke up the next morning, you could barely recognize him.  Aya's slaps could be compared to getting eight punches from Nami or kicks from Sanji.

The plan of the day:
Eat breakfast.
Bathe.
Look for outfits
Free time
Coronation.

Basically, a regular day for a normal person, counting the fact that they were about to become Queen of a Kingdom and Millie started having second thoughts.

"What if, I don't become a good ruler. What if the people revolt? I can't do this!" Twilight worried pulling strands of her hair.

"But Princess-sama, you're so nice and kind. Nobody would ever rebel against such a ruler." The guards said trying to comfort her.

"But what if I.."

"Quit whining." Haruka scolded. "I know you must be feeling very anxious and scared but I'm sure you have a trusted Council."

"Yeah, I do."

"Then you'll be alright. I know you can rule this kingdom to the best of your ability and the people will love you." Haruka (who for once in his life actually said kind and encouraging words without cursing) said to the Princess, holding her shoulders.

Millie looked and him and away blushing before pushing his face out of hers.

"Fucking bitch, I was trying to encourage you!"

"That moment was spoilt."

"Pretty much."

After the delicious breakfast, the trio of girls went to the royal bath.

Since, all three of them being Devil fruit users, they only had their feet dangling in the water but the steam from the natural,hot, mineral bath cooled them down.

"Are you still worried about becoming Queen, Millie-chan?" Aya asked, scrubbing her back.

"Not really. I realized that its my duty."

"Too bad."

"Haruka wanted to come in here so bad." Sakura joked about laughing whilst shampooing her hair.

"Yeah, isn't there a unisex bath?"

"Yeah, there is but I didn't really want Haruka-senpai to see me in the bath?"
