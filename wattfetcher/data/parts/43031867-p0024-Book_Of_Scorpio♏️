You love so hard and because you love so intensely, you frown (and act) upon even the slightest feeling of maliciousness at the hands of loved ones, especially your romantic partners.
You often feel like you're not good enough and due to this form of low self esteem (inferiority complex), you inadvertently act in ways to boost yourself (being critical of others shortcomings, seeking quick fixes of attention, etc)
