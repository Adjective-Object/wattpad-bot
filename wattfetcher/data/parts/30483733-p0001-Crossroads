"What if?" Those were the two words that Harper Lee Fayt kept asking herself each and everyday. What if she hadn't joined the chess club...would she of been more popular? What if she dyed her hair magenta... would her parents go ballistic? Yes probably... But she can't help to wonder what would of happened, if at each crossroad she took the other path. One night she goes to sleep, miserable and dreaming about her lame job at Burger Paradise and how her college experience has been an awful one, and the next morning she wakes up on the first day of her Junior year in High School. Harper gets the chance to go back and do things differently; prom, choosing a career path, and even losing her precious v-card. But remember to always choose wisely...
