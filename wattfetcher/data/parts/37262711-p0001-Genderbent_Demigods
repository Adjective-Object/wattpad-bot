I wake up in my cabin (in the Argo II) and pull on some gray sweats and a huge white shirt. I walk out groggily, my hair in my eyes. Huh. I don't remember it being that long.
I sit down in the mess hall. No one's there. I fold my arms on the table and lay my head down in them, face down. I hear someone walk in. "Mmmm..." I grunt.
"P-Percy?" I hear a girl's voice say.
"What?" I say, confused. My voice is a lot higher than normal. Weird. I look up. A thin, strong looking girl with long sandy blonde hair and crystal blue eyes. She's really tall and has a small scar on her lips. I laugh. She looks like she could be Jason's sister.
"Who're you?" The girl raises an eyebrow.
"Jason. Dude, it's me!" I laugh.
"Yeah, okay. And I'm Annabeth Chase."
"Look at yourself." I do. I look down. I jump out of the seat and scream. High-pitched. I tug at my hair. Down to my shoulder blades. I scream again.
"WHAT IS GOING ON?!" I yell at Jason.
"I don't know. Let's go see if the rest have changed."
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-(Switching to iPad so format may be different)Jason and I walk cautiously into Leo's room. Sure enough, laying in his bed was a scrawny (does that word apply to girls?) Latino girl with long curly hair and features that made her look like an elf, along with several burn marks on her arms. She was sucking her thumb. Really, Leo?
Jason shakes him/her awake. "Leo... Leo wake up." I push my bro aside.
"I got this." I take a glass of water off Leo's nightstand and wave my hand over it, making it ice cold. I dump it on Leo's forehead. He bolts upright in his bed.
"Woah!" His voice is really high and slightly squeaky. "Dude. Who are you? Why are there two girls in my cabin? JASON!" He yells. I scowl.
"Dude," Jason says. "It's us. Jason and Percy. We woke up like this..."
I hang my head in mock disappointment. "We ain't flawless..."
Jason rolls his eyes. "You're a girl, too." Leo looks down at himself and yelps.
"Pan's pipes! What happened?"
I raise my eyebrows. "I have no clue. Let's go wake up the new men of the ship."
