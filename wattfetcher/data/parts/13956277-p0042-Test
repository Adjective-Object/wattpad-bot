I woke up knowing it might be my last day here. I deserve it anway.
I dragged myself out of bed, didn't brush my hair or teeth and didn't even wash my face, I was sad don't judge me, then I wrapped something around my head and went down to have breakfast.
"ugghhh you look disgusting" Damone said.
"Shut up, at least be nice with me for my last day here" I pu
lled a spoon to eat
"Okay, but you could at least wash your face"
"Leave me alone Damon" I went back to my room to get ready for school. Don't worry, I washed my face and brushed my teeeth eventually.

I crossed the gates looking like a zombie with Elina holding my hand and looking stunnig like always.
I headed to my locker where I saw Tom.
"Hey"
"I'm really not in the mood, leave me alone"
"I can see ... What's werong" He seemed interested
"I'm going back home"
"What ? why?" He looked surprised and sad
"Because I lied to my parents"
"It's not a big deal, we all tell lies"
"you have no idea" I slammed my locker and everyone stared at me.
"sorry" I said then walked to my class.
...............
lunch time.
"What's wrong with the hotty" Simon said jokingly
"Nothing" I smiled, Simon was the only good boy here, I don't even know why he hangs out with William, Jake, Damon, Peter and the others.
"Don't lie to me babe" Jake winked.
"I'm gonna take a break from you" I smirked
"And what's that supposed to mean" He frowned
"I'm going back home" I said
"What why" Simon and Jake asked.
"Because I'm sick of you always going after me,Jake"
"Are you really going back" He asked
"Yes I am,Jake" I took a sip from my orange juice. I LOVE ORANGE.
"I won't annoy you again If you stay, please don't go. If you go who am I gonna stare at all the time and wonder how can anyone look hot that much" Jake sat beside me.
"You really are annoying" I threw the orange juice all over his face and left the seat.
"That tastes good" He said loudly while everyone was laughing.
"I'd give you more tomorrow if I wasn't going back to my country"I said. and all the boys' faces fell.
..............
I went back home and packed my bags.
"LEENA" Damon shouted
"WHAT DO YOU WANT"
