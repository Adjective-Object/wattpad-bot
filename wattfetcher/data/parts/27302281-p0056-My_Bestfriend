I helped Pattie clear the table I grabbed the plates and wobbled to the kitchen i felt someone come up behind me and kiss me on the cheek and I knew those soft lips any where
" Justin your gonna make me drop them " I whined fixing the plates in my arms
" here let me " he said taking all the plates and balancing them on one arm then walking into the kitchen I mumbled under my breath and rolled my eyes
" show off " I scoffed walking back to the table to finishing cleaning it off as I grabbed the cups Justin came up behind me and grabbed my waist and pulled me to him
" you better be glad I set the cups down " I smirked at him as he rested his head on my forehead
" I have to clean up" I said pulling away from him and picking up the cups and walking into the kitchen as I begin to wash the dishes Pattie came up behind me
" dear you don't have to clean up I can manage " she said gathering the dishes
" Pattie its the least I can do " I said trying to persuade her to go sit down
" Honey you have done enough as long as you keep my son happy that's all I need OK " she said trying to convince me but it isn't gonna work
" Pattie " I whined
" go relax with Justin ". She pleaded staring at her son standing In the doorway
" Pattie " I whined again then added " can I at least dry them " I pleaded once more hoping I could convince her
" come on " Justin said picking me up and taking me into the other room then carrying me upstairs I raised an eyebrow as he entered his room with me thrown over his shoulder and set me on the bed and locked the door
" now relax " he said laying on the bed with me and staring straight at me
" why did you lock the door " I asked eyeing him suspiciously
" because I want time with my girlfriend " he whispered
" we could have done that downstairs " I stated
" not what im wanting do " he smirked
" perv " I pushed him and he fell off the bed then my eyes widened
" I'm so sorry " I apologized helping him off the floor and tried my hardest not to die laughing
" what's funny babe " he smirked pulling me to the floor and climbing on top of me and bringing his lips down to mine
" nothing " I whispered again its his lips I stared up at him and I looked in his eyes then his lips then back at his eyes he then smirked and started to kiss my jawline I grabbed his chin and he crashed his lips with mine as if he knew what I wanted he slowly intertwined our fingers and deepened the kiss then moved to my neck and moved my head to give him a little room he made kisses down my neck and went back up and kissed my jawline then returned to my lips I tried to flip us over but I couldnt he finally got the idea and flipped us over so I was on top and I kissed him like I meant it I tugged at his shirt which made him smirk once more.
" Justin " Pattie yelled knocking on Justin's door
" yeah mom" he yelled back climbing off of me and helping me up
" y'all come downstairs " Pattie yelled out then she walked off down the stairs then Justin turned to me and fixing my lipstick and adjusted my shirt then his then he ran his fingers through his hair
" Justin come here " I said wiping my lipstick off his lips and wiping it off my lips with my hands and pecking Justin softly on the lips then grabbed his hand and led him downstairs .
