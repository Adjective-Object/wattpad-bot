---CHAPTER V: Three Paths (Part 3)---
//Canada's PoV!~//
As I began to regain my consciousness, I hear a voice calling out my name.
"Hey, Canada!!"
Whose voice was that..?
"Wake up, you bloody wanker! Open your eyes!"
Oh. It's England.
I tried to gather enough energy to bring myself to get up. I start to flutter open my eyes and let it adjust to the sudden brightness. My vision was blurry...where are my glasses?
I still felt disoriented, but I managed to speak.
"Egh... Ha... uh? ... Wh.. Whaz'happened?" I asked the emerald-eyed man who was sitting beside me.
"I don't know! ______ rushed over to me and told me that she found you unconscious here so we headed over here as soon as we can. When I found you, you were lying on the floor, near the piano, with maple syrup." He replied.
I creased my brow for a moment as my hands searched for my glasses. It was beside the maple syrup bottle I had. Now it's all covered in the sweet liquid...not that I don't like it. I began wiping it with my handkerchief.
"You scared me! Did something happen!?" England asked with a worried expression.
I decided that it was best not to explain to him how the Thing suddenly appeared in the room...not to mention it not seeing me. (=__=")
"Ah... Hem... No... I can't remember very well but... Since the flow of time is strange, you didn't run into it..." I told him.
He tilted his head. "Run into... what?"
I felt a sharp pain in my head. "Aouch... My head hurts...I... I don't think that creature will be coming to this room for a while...That's all I'm going to say."
I finally finished cleaning up my glasses. As I put it back on, I noticed something.
"Ah... I...England...you said that _____ told you about me, right?" I asked him.
England raised an eyebrow. "Yeah, we both headed here--"
He suddenly turned his head to the door and saw no one.
"Bloody hell. W-Where did she go?!" England exclaimed.
We both got up to our feet.
"This is bad. We shouldn't let her walk around this place alone!" I told him.
"Right. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't notice that she wasn't following after me." England said in low voice.
"Where could she be?" I asked as headed towards the door.
"Maybe she's still in the library on this floor. That's where I last saw her." The Brit replied.
"Alright, let's go." I said.
We both rushed towards the other room across the hall. I was about to open the door of the room, when I suddenly heard voices coming from the other side.
"N-No...I don't...."
My eyes widened. Was someone in there? Is it the monster?!
I flung the door open and ran inside. England followed.
"______!" England shouted.
The (h/c) girl stood there, her back facing us. She was just standing still. What's wrong?
