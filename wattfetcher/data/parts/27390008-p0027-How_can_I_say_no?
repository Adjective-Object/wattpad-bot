"Yeah. We should." I said. Then I remembered his beanie and shirt. I held them out to him. "Here. I've been meaning to give them back." I said. Johnny shook his head.
"Keep them. Let them remind you of me." He said. He took them and opened my suitcase. He put the shirt in it and two other shirts he had. I watched as he zipped my suitcase back up. He took the beanie and put it on me. I smiled as he trailed his hands down to my cheeks. He cupped my face and smiled. "So beautiful. How did I get so lucky?" He whispered. I blushed.
"I don't know. I don't know how I got so lucky either." I said. Johnny smiled and reached behind him.
"I have three things for you." He said. He pulled a sweatshirt from his suitcase and put it around my shoulders. I smiled and pulled it tightly against me. It smelled just like Johnny. Johnny smiled. Then he reached behind his neck and took off one of his necklaces. He reached around me and put it on me. Pulling my hair out of the chain, he ran his finger over the chain to the pendant. It was a small blue stone in a gold setting. I watched johnny as he put both his hands behind his back. "I know this isn't much." He said. He moved his hands back in front of him and showed me one of his rings. The skull one with red eyes. I smiled weakly. I had adored that one for years. "But I know how much you like it. I also know it's not a proper ring to do this with but it would mean more to both of us than any other ring." Johnny said. He put it on my hand. Johnny took a deep breath. "I'm giving you that ring as a promise. I'll be back for you. I love you too much to let you go so easily. I promise I'll be true to you and I won't cheat. I'll only be a phone call away if you need me and I'll pick up no matter what. I promise my love to you and only you. I love you." Johnny said. Then it hit me. He was giving me the ring as a promise ring. And he gave me this ring not because he was cheap but because it meant something to him and now it would mean something to me. I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him. I had started crying again.
"Thank you Johnny." I whispered. "I love you too." Johnny returned my hug. All to soon he broke away.
"We need to go." He said. I nodded sadly. We got up and went down to the car that would take us to the airport. We drove there in silence; neither of us really having anything to say. We arrived and checked in. Johnny bought me McDonald's again. I smiled.
"Ending just like we began huh?" I asked. Johnny smiled sadly.
"I guess. I'm gonna miss you." He said. I nodded.
"I'll miss you so much." I said. We sat and ate in silence.
"Flight 514 to Chicago now boarding." We heard. I got up.
"That's me." I said sadly. I hugged Johnny to me tightly.
"I don't want you to go. I love you too much to let you go." He said.
"I don't want to go. I love you too much too. But if you love someone let them go. If they come back they love you too." I said. Johnny held me against him.
"Screw whoever said that. They didn't know us." He said. I laughed. Johnny and I pulled away. Tears started to form in my eyes.
"I love you Johnny. I'll call you once I get home." I said. Johnny nodded.
"I love you too. I'll pick up, even if I'm on my plane still." He said. I gave him a smile and reached into my backpack.
"Here. To remember me by." I said. I handed him my loki beanie, my oversized disney sweatshirt, and my class ring. "It's not much but it's part of me." I turned around and went to my gate. I waited ten minutes. As I was about to board, I saw Johnny. He was running to the gate.
