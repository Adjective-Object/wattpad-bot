Okay, this will sound VERY crazy but...I had a dream about drawing. The most colorful dream I've ever had. (Yes I saw Lionfang again :P FaolanWolf WHY DOES HE SHOW UP IN MY DREAMS?!) and I saw graffiti on my mom's old apartment building. It was a cat and a dog so I drew the cat. But it was being drawn in my dream by something invisible.... Okay so I'll draw the dog next. (No they weren't colored in.) I know >_< it sound really crazy, but just trust me on this one. You can unfollow me if you want, just....its your choice whether to believe me or not...
