Lucifer was created with wisdom and understanding. after the great war the heavens had won over the evil. god had cast Lucifer and all the other angels to hell .Lucifer became known as Satan and the angels that followed were the devil. time went by and the legend had become a myth to the human race .what they didn't know that hell was , in reality earth it self and what happens when the dark army wants to rebel and take over what was theirs first . god saw this coming and designed a solution invested in human , as a child shall be born who shall have the power to lock and guard the gates of hell . it is time for the child be born on earth , to create balance to the earth but what the child doesn't know is the price that comes with it and all the tests she will be taken up on . join the war and see what happens . destiny will be written again by a human , fate will be changed , the laws will be broken .
