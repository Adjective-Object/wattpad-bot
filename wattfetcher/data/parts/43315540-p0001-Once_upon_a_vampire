As the car doors slams loud music is being played while others are drinking. "Grab a beer." Demanded Rick. "Why not?" Serena thought to herself.

Rick said happily as he pulled Serena close and slowly reached in for a kiss. "Hey. Not right now, please? Maybe later." Serena said with a smerk.CRASH! "What was that!" Screamed Serena. they both ran towards the dock. Serena and Rick panic when they find a man laying on the dock bleeding drastically from the head. "Who did this?" Screamed Rick.
