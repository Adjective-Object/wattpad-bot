"That's Alexandra's step dad." I replied,setting my backpack down and pulling out my homework.
"Oh,I thought he was your dad and I'm like "why is she calling him by his first name and not dad instead" and why he looked so different." Jack laughed.
I laughed along and started doing my homework.

If you dont know who Toby Logan is,he is a character on the show The Listener.He has the ability to read peoples minds (no he's not a creep.Reading minds is who he is and what he does.he can't control it.He was born with this ability)and he's kind of attractive ;).He has blue eyes and I put him in the story as Alex's step dad to make this story more interesting,you know...because he can read minds and knows what people are thinking inside their head.Thats the reason I made him Toby Logan and not Craig Olejnik. (his real name.)
So yeah Toby Logan not Craig Olejnik
