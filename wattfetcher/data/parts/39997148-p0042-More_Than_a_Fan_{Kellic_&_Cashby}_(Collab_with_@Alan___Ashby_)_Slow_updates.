"No, no I'm alright. Thanks though."
"Alright well I'll see you around." I said and left quickly.
I went to the front and sighed. That was awkward. Like really awkward and maybe Aaron's right, maybe Alan really isn't interested in me. Or maybe he is but he's just being awkward about it. I can't give up on him. Not now. I sighed again, I'm starving.
I headed out of the bus to find everyone in Pierce along with people from the other bands standing around something laughing quietly.
"Whats so funny?" I asked them all.
"Just Kellin and Vic. They got wasted last night even though we told Kellin to make sure that he only had one beer. And instead Vic corrupted the poor naive little fanboy so we're giving them a little I guess punishment." Mike told me.
"What did you do to them?" I asked and he moved away to show me the two idiots.
"Oh my god." I said laughing. They were both stripped down to nothing but their boxers and were covered in marshmallows, alcohol and all kinds of other shit. Not to mention it looked like they were cuddling.
Speaking of cuddling.
"Did you see them last night?" I asked and he shook his head.
"No what'd they do?"
"They were getting at it like a couple of jack rabbits."
"Told you he likes Kellin." Jaime said elbowing Mike who was smirking.
"Man where's Alan when we need him." Phil muttered looking down at the two.
"How did they not wake up during all of this?" I asked.
"Dude they did this to themselves." Mike told me.
"Really?"
"Yeah they stripped down to just their underwear then they got in a food fight and next thing you know they're passed out on the ground so we just left them here."
"Yeah and when Alan gets here we need him to take pictures of these idiots." Tony said just as Alan walked out of the bus.
"Hi." He said, "What's going on?"
"We need you to take a picture of Vic and Kellin."
"I don't have my camera on me."
"Dammit." Mike groaned and pulled out his phone, "We still need a picture." He said and snapped a few of the two idiots.
"True." He said, "So what- how did this happen?"
"They got wasted and well this is the aftermath."
"Idiots." He muttered, "Aren't you going to wake them up?"
"Nope."
"Why not?"
"Because we told Kellin to not let Vic get drunk and this happened." Tony told him.
"Told you he likes him though." Jaime said elbowing Tony in the ribs.
"Yes Jaime, I get it." Tony said pushing him away from him, "Stop elbowing me."
"Maybe now people will stop shipping Fuenciado." Mike offered.
"Doubt it." I said.
"But it's so gross!" Jaime whined.
"We know, we know."
"Well you can't just leave them here." Lynn said, "We have to hit the road soon."
