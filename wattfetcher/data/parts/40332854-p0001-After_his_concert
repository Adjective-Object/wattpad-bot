This is my first story, so please don't be to harsh on the comments. I'm very proud of it, considering it's my first story.
Joe (POV)
Well...it's officially over. Blanda and I broke up a week ago and I've never felt so alone. I feel like a part of me is missing and I won't be able to get it back. It's my last concert of my tour tonight and I'm dedicating Kleptomaniac to her. She broke my heart. Hopefully I meet someone new soon, I don't deserve to feel like this.
Before the show
I hear people shouting "JOE! JOE! JOE! JOE!" They really want me out there. My manager says it's time to go out on stage. I'm really excited to perform tonight. I go out on stage and say "ARE YOU READY FOR THE FASTLIFE?!" Everyone in the audience is screaming "YES" I start the show with FastLife every time. After I finished the rest of my songs, I said to the crowd "Now it's time for my last song of the night. I saved Just In Love for last because I'm going to bring up a lucky lady to the stage, so we can sing Just In Love together. WHO WANTS IT MOST?!" Once I said that, the stadium was filled with a bunch of screaming girls wanting to be chosen, but there was one girl that caught my eye, so I walked off stage, took her hand, and brought her onto the stage. I asked her "What's your name and where are you from?" She said "My name is Julia and I'm from Boston, Massachusetts" I told her that I wanted her to sing Just In Love with me and her eyes widened. I chuckled at her facial expression, because I definitely caught her by surprise. We started singing Just In Love together and I have to admit that she has a really beautiful voice, she was a little bit nervous. I could sense that, because the microphone in her hand was shaking, so I grabbed her hand and interlocked our hands. That seemed to calm her down. After the song I said "THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT" to the crowd and took Julia's hand and pulled her backstage with me.
