I smirked. "Now I'm curious."
Claude pulled off his glove with his teeth. My (E/C) eyes widened at the sight. His fingernails were black, and had some sort of... star on it.
"I'm a demon, (F/N)."

"...We were close friends. Close enough for me to know almost everything about demons. He was the one to teach me how to fight."
"That's why knives are your specialty then?"
"Yep."
We entered the kitchen and Sebastian set out a teapot, tea leaves, a spoon, and boiling water.
"Now then, let's begin."
He picked up the spoon and scooped up some of the tea.
"Now, you put a spoon for each person, and one for the pot."
Sebastian scooped four spoonfuls of tea leaves into the teapot.
"Then, you make sure the water's boiling hot. Next, you pour it in."
He demonstrated this perfectly, and then added sugar and cream.
"Now we can serve it."
Sebastian set the tea on a cart and pushed it out of the room. I walked next to him in the large hallway.
"Wait, I didn't help at all!"
He smirked. "That was my plan."
"Tch. You just wanted to ask me that?"
"Yes."
"Damn demon."
The butler chuckled at my response and continued down the hall.
"I'll let you serve. But, if you make a mistake, I'll have to punish you." He smirked seductively.
"Fine..." Punish me? In his dreams.
Sebastian pushed the cart into the lounge and placed it next to the table.
I walked up to it and began to carefully pour the tea. Two flawless cups. One more.
My hand shook as I poured the last cup. A small bead of tea spilled onto the cart. Shit!
I finished the cup and set it in front of Ciel.
"Thank you, (F/N)." He said.
I bowed respectfully. "Of course, my lord."
Sebastian followed me out of the room and smirked devilishly.
"You made a mistake, my dear.~"
Sebastian threw me over his shoulder and carried me to a bedroom.
'Oh god. What is he going to do to me?!'
