I have posted my first chapter of Demigods! YAY
HERE IS A SNIP OF IT!
A child you say Lady Artimis" Artimis had arrived in the palace of the Underworld to visit the Goddess of Magic and crossroads "Why a child? My Lady why would I create a child? Why?" she inquired "The monsters in the upper world are growing more and more powerful I'm worried that there will be no more heroes but this one she will represent me, fight for me, and eventually she will be a heroine" Artimis gave Hecate a small star which dimly shone in light in the dark light "make this dying star into a child, a girl and then she will represent you to and show the world the joys and fears of magic". The girl was put on the doorstep of the Jackson's they were demigods to, a son of Poseidon and a daughter of Athena they had many similarities except she was pure magic they took her in and cared for her as if she was their own and loved her like she had their blood but deep down they knew that she was a Demigod.
