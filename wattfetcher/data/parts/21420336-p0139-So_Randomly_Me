When having a random book like this one, here are things you should keep in consideration:
*keep chapters short, people reading this probably are as random as you and will get either bored or distracted if your chapter is too long
* Do not update TOO much, it is okay to update often but updating too much in one day will most likely confuse the readers and they wont read all the chapters.
* It is your book, write whatever you want and do not fear getting judged for it.
Now these are just like a few that Ive noticed help from my random book and a lot of other really popular ones
At the same time, you could have long chapters and update a gazillion times everyday and still have a lot of reads and comments. Updating often shows that you are really enjoying yourself.
It all basically really depends on you and your style of writing.
Mines not very organized but thats okay. :3 I'm not at school.
See you guys later ^.^
