A/N: Two things I will only be making A/Ns in this story if it's something I find important to say. Also this is going to be updated slowly just letting you, random person, know this now.
P.S. Cover is made by _Daylight_ which is why this chapter is dedicated to that account.

The messenger gave me a sad look as he uttered the words I did not expect to hear so soon. "Your father has just passed away a few hours ago."
My shaking hand covered my mouth as I stumbled backwards into my house, nearly tripping on my own bare feet as I search blindly for a nearby seat. The messenger, or bearer of bad news in this case, climbed off his black horse, and walked into my house after me to try to comfort me. My tears rolled uncontrollably down my cheeks, blurring my vision.
The messenger lead me, taking a hold of my thin arm, to a wooden chair he spotted at my kitchen table. I couldn't believe the news as I shook uncontrollably. I knew I shouldn't have let him, or anyone really, see me cry like this, but my father and I were close and the news of his death wouldn't change that for the world.
The messenger seemed awkward as he patted my back gently, saying no words. What could he say? Sorry for your loss? I wouldn't doubt that he knew it would mean nothing to me.
After a while my tears ceased to come from my eyes. This is when the messenger decided it was his time to be on his way, after all he had mail to be delivered.
When he got to the doorway I called out to him from my place at the kitchen table. "Wait, do you remember who told you?"
He looked back over his shoulder at me. "Phillip Brereton."
He then left my home, closing the wooden door behind him. I watched out the window on the far side of the room and saw him leave on his horse. I could hear the thumping of hooves through the window. After a few moments of staring at nothing outside the window I got up and brewed myself some barley tea.
I only drank barely tea when I needed something comforting to drink. Normally I chose the unpopular choice of water. No one understood my drinking habits, but they usually just said nothing and let me do as I wished.
I sat down on my couch, covering my legs with a white knitted blanket, that my grandmother had made for me. I silently sat there staring at nothing in particular drinking my tea. Finally I finished my tea. I walked back to my kitchen, rinsed the cup out, and sat it on the counter.
I blew out the lone candle that had been burning, and feeling numb emotionally I went to bed.

After doing my daily work for the day I head for Phillip's house in hopes he was home and not already at work. When I got to his house I walked down the grassy pathway and up to his front door. The door looked old and worn. The house was made of gray stone and the roof made of straw, or hay, or something.
I knocked on the door gently. To my surprise the door swung open almost immediately. Phillip stood in the doorway surprise of seeing me there written on his face.
"What do you need, miss? I'm running behind on getting to work on time."
The Breretons were both in their thirties. Phillip thirty-nine and Roesia thirty-four. Though Phillip was only in his thirties he already had gray hair going through his goatee and the brown hair on top of his head.
Wrinkles were one thing you associated with this man. Not to be mean, but it's his most defining quality. He was always wearing leather shoes and brown slacks. A stripped white and blue dress shirt. He actually worked for the king so they have some pretty good money.
