"Melanie? I thought you were asleep." He whispered. "You should go back to sleep."
I frowned in the darkness, only barely making out Paul's figure from the glow of the television.
"Come here." I whined, wanting to cuddle. I heard Paul chuckle and then felt the bed shift as he climbed onto it. He wrapped his arms around me and placed a kiss on my neck.
"I see  you're watching H.S.M."
"Mmmhmm." I mumbled, turning around to peck him on the lips. "What did you do today?"
"I hung out with Danny until about 5 PM, and then for a few hours I went to the field and practiced soccer, and after that, I had a mini meetup."
"How'd the meetup go?" My face was buried in his chest and I was breathing in his scent.
"Good." He kissed my forehead and rubbed my back. "Are you wearing my shirt?"
"Maybe..."
His chest rattled as he chuckled. I flicked his side.
"Go back to sleep." He stated, rubbing my back some more.
"Love you." I mumbled quietly, already drifting back off into sleep.
I think I heard him say "I love you more" before I dozed off, but I couldn't be sure.
My dreams were filled of what our wedding would be like. Our honeymoon too. But of course, it was also filled with how hot he would look in a tux.
A/N: damn  took me a while to update. sorry? eh not really. anyway, I've been really busy, what with testing, and then packing constantly . My mom has been forcing me to clean the house a lot too, because of us moving and wanting someone to buy the house.
You would think that after 16 times, packing and moving would be easier but nope FREAKING ANNOYING JUST AS MUCH AS THE OTHER 16 TIMES
