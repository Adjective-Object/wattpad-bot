France smiled. "Okay~"


As they cautiously got outside of the room, they saw a huge, grey, alien-like creature.


"......!! Aargh!! What is that?! It's huge!" France shrieked.


Prussia positioned his sword in front of him to attack. "Victory goes to the one who makes the first move (take two)! Let's go!!" he shouted as he charged towards the monster. He was able to hit the creature, causing it to recoil a little.


"Oh! You blew it off!" France exclaimed. Hey, this is kind of bad. Spain! Go call Spain!" France panicked.

Prussia facepalmed. "Shit, I should have invited him. I fail."

"Well, what are we going to do now? We can't go back into the room, and we're not fit to fight..." France asked, feeling deeply troubled.

Prussia snapped his fingers. "I know! Let's run! Retreat, retreat!"

"Wait, are you serious? We have nowhere to run." France told him.

Prussia thought for a moment. "Oh, yeah! We have to put it off the track and go back to wake up West and the others!"

France raised an eyebrow and gave him a look of disbelief. "And you think the two of us can put it to rout?"


"Okay! Let's fight with all our might!" Prussia urged.

"Phew, that was dangerous. But we still shook it off somehow, huh? I really am amazing." Prussia said proudly, panting a little. As he was walking down the stairs to the first floor, he spotted someone. "H-Hey, isn't that Russia passed out over there?" he pointed at a tall Russian man who seemed all bruised.

France took a better look at what his friend was referring to. "What? O-Oh? What--what happened?"

"Shit! I'm sorry, you two. I failed to be the hero..." America said in a low voice, frowning.


France eyes widened as he saw another monster attacking his fellow countries. "What?! What's that monster doing there?!"
"It couldn't possibly have got here ahead of us! But if it knocked out Russia... this time the odds are really against us." Prussia said in a hopeless tone.
