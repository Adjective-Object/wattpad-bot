Smoked the first cigarette out of the pack,
And all ten of us made a pact
If one of us were to leave this earth
We'd live our life for them, better or worse
Well, the first one died of an overdose
The second one let their blood run out so slow
The third jumped off of a bridge
The fourth "fell" out of a boat and willed themself not to swim
The fifth one hung themself from a noose
The sixth one smoked some things that made them feel loose
The seventh one shot a gun to end it all
The eighth laid out in the snow and frooze
They were all on the ball
The ninth stepped in front of a high speed train
And I was left to deal with the pain
Smoked the last cigarette out of the pack
And I decided to break the pact
If there is only one left on this earth
They're gonna kill themself to save them from the worse
