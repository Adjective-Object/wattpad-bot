(Charlottes POV)WHAT! NO,No,No! I cannot be pregnant I'm only fifteen. The stick with the pink plus sign couldn't be wrong ? I'll take another test just be to sure . (10minutes later) Dang it's not negative again! How did this happen.....oh yeah Sydney's house. At first I didn't remember anything because I was drunk. But now it's been four weeks since then. How am I gonna tell my parents ? How am I gonna tell Henry ?I can't tell Henry he'll hate me forever but he's the father of this baby and he's kid danger who helps captain man protect Swell view. ohh what am I going to do? It'll ruin our friendship. Charlotte started having a panic attack. Ca...lm. d.o.w...n Char...Lotte this isn't good for the baby (I was trying to tell myself) Ok maybe if I just drink some tea out on the back deck. Maybe that will ease my nerves yeah that's what I'll doAfter sitting out on the deck for a while it really helped me clear my mind. But I'm still not sure how to tell everyone this.Luckily I'm not showing yet,but everyone will notice eventually . For now I just decided to not tell anyone for now and wait a little while. Besides they say the best time to tell people your having a baby is when your twelve weeks.
