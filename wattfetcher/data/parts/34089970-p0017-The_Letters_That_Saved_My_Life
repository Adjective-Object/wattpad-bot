I sat in English just staring off into space, when I felt the need to cut. I needed to feel the cold blade slide against my skin as I felt the slightest of a sting. My hand itched to hold the small cold blade.
"Earth to Robin...." Katie said as she waved her hand in front of my face.
"Oh, sorry what did you say?" I asked as I looked over at her with a fake smile plastered on my face.
"The bell just rang for lunch..." She told me with a concerned look on her face.
"How did you not hear that??" She asked as I grabbed my backpack.
"I was just thinking." I replied as we walked into the cafeteria...
~After School~
I walked into my house only to find Derrick sitting in the living room with Hunter and Katie.
"What are you guys doing here..?" I asks as the whispering stops. They look at me as if just realizing I was here.
"Oh! Robin, hey. We are working on a school project..." Katie replied.
"Okay. Have fun, if you need me for any reason I'll be in my room." I told them as I walked into my room, shutting the door behind me. Setting my backpack on the ground I walked over to my bed and sat on it. Buzz! My phone went off, I grabbed it. After unlocking my phone I got on to Wattpad, Black_Raven192 has sent you a private message.
I'll see you soon.
?
I looked down at my phone, but there was never a reply...
"Not until we are lost do we begin to find ourselves." ~Unknown
