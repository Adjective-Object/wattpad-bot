Fawn. My own sister never came back to the hospital just to see if any of us made it. If I was in her position then, I would've called the ambulance right away and made sure everyone was okay. Who wouldn't of wanted to have their family survive? Isn't that the ideal thing to do?
Zayn. He was such a sweetheart, until the night of the party. The boy closed his walls and left me out. I asked a simple question. He turned from sweet to rude all too quickly. All I wanted was an answer.
Harry. There's so many questions I can form about him. He's so.. so complicated. One day he'll whisper cute things in my ear and joke with me then the next day, he'll be so cold and closed. I think that's what makes me so attracted to him, I just want to know what he's thinking. I want to get to know Harry. If he would open up a little more, we could be great friends. I hope he will someday..
On que, Harry barges through the front door. I quickly put my thoughts behind and greet him.
"I heard you were with your stepfather today. How was it?" I smiled. This was risky. He could either freak on me, or reply back.
"Erm.. It was.. good," he tenses and looks away. I can tell he's lying. Something went wrong that he doesn't want me to know about and it's sort of scary.
I decide not to push him any farther for now and say, "That's great. Are you hungry? I was about to make dinner. The others are at the theatre, but they should be back soon."
He relaxes a little and grins, "Yes ma'am."
"Excuse me? I prefer Miss. Cooper! Thank you very much, Styles," I playfully demand. I like this side of Harry much better.
"Oh so now I'm "Styles"," he shakes is head, chuckling. I walk to the kitchen and he follows behind.
"Yes, you are," I smirk and then open the top cabinet to find pasta. Unfortunately, I'm a few inches short to grab it. A hand hovers over me, taking out the blue box full of uncooked noodles.
"Is this what you wanted, Miss. Cooper?" He grins and my breath hitches. Something about his closeness makes me feel.. different inside. It's not a bad type of different either.
"Um.." I hesitate at loss for words, "Yeah, that's it. Thanks."
I bit my lip and search for a pot. After a few seconds, I find it and fill it half way with water. Next, I put it on the stove, turning the heat up and setting the pasta box down.
There's a comforting silence. Harry walks back over to me. I know what he's about to do and I'm not sure if I should do it to. Before I can even process what's happening, I collide my lips with his.
He battles for entrance, but I deny which makes him groan. I kind of laugh. Harry presses harder and I finally let him in. He smiles through the kiss. The usual butterflies that everyone talks about begin. I let out a little moan.
A burning scent fills my nose. The pasta. Shit.
"Harry.." I moan trying to get his attention.
"Lennon.." He groans. The burning smell is starting to grow.
"Harry.. the.. the pasta.. it's burning," I say between kisses and he immediately stops. It's bubbling over the metal pot. I turn off the stove and dump out the water into the sink. Smoke is clouding the kitchen so I turn the ceiling fan on and it starts to clear up. Thank God we didn't start a fire, but now we don't have dinner.
"Pizza?" I ask.
"Pizza." He agrees and we both burst into laughter.
