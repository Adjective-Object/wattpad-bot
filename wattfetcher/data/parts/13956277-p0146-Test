"At last launch time" I sighed and went to a random table to sit on.
"Bi***" A girl said, People had been annoying me everyday by sharp words, but what could I do ?
"You want to brainwash the kids and blow up the school or something? ugghhh muslims" Another girl mocked.
I really couldn't take it anymore, So I stood on the table, Molly had the 'What the hell are you doing ?' Look on her face.
"What's she doing?" Damon asked the guys, I hadn't seen him for a while though.
"NOW LISTEN TO ME PLEASE, EVERYONE" I successfully earned their attention. Simon had a look that cannot be described on his face.
"My name Leena Ahmed, Arabian muslim and proud, I used to live in Jordan, I came here to study. Lately I've been acting different, I took off my hijab and got into some shorts and I changed my attitude, but Hey ! Everybody makes mistakes, nobody is perfect. I lost my parents almost two months ago, I got shocked and this shock has changed me. Losing the closest people I had, and not being with them in their last minutes tortured me, I had mixed emotions, I couldn't decide what was right and what was wrong, I thought that God hated me and that's why he took my parents away. I wanted to revenge, revenge from got for taking away my parents, but this was stupid. I was stupid and I couldn't think correctly. I couldn't realize the fact that God doesn't hate me, that God didn't take my parents to torture me. He took him to Test me, to test my faith in him. I didn't realize that my parents got into a better place. I started partying, drinking and doing bigger mistakes and sins *glances at Simon* But, you know what ? I'm thankful. I honestly am. Because I got to actually see how precious my Religion is, I got to see how it runs my whole life and without it I'm nothing, that I will get lost without it, that I will fail without it. I realized that Islam is everything. Without Islam,Â  without the rules of Islam. We will all get lost. And now, I'm trying to erase my sins by getting back to the right path" Everyone was left speechless, so I continued : "If anyone has a question about Islam, me, Tom and Molly will be glad to answer it, I guess we have the right to defend our religion" I said then headed to the table where I had the books and papers about Islam
I heard someone clapping, I turned my head around and it was Tom, then everyone started to clap with him for me, I glanced at Simon "Good job" He mouthed.
Diana, Hannah and all my friends asked for some books and papers, boys headed to Tom for answers, Molly got the kids and I hand the ladies. Our corner was the most crowded one until ....
"WHAT'S GOING ON" I heard the principal shouting and all the students spread around like water. "Hi, this is our project to introduce Islam correctly" I smiled widely, he didn't seem very happy, "I'd appreciate it if you read this" I handed him a book and he took it quietly, when he left, everybody cane back to us and continued asking questions.
