Gradually, we fell into a routine. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays were physical training and Tuesdays and Thursdays were mental (The holograms) and we had Saturday and Sunday to recover. It was hard some days and easy others. I preferred physical training best. It wasn't as straining. Bucky liked them better too. Weeks passed. One month. No new missions. Then we did something different.
We had always used dummies and boxing bags for training, but today we were using actual people. This was the first time I would actually be fighting anyone other then Bucky. Well, excepting my one mission. I was scared. But as the fight started, I actually began to get into it. My heart was pumping and my body seemed in sync with my brain. Adrenaline was high. I don't remember the fight at all. One thing I will never forget was the end. The man slumped to the ground.
At first I thought he had passed out, but as I looked into his lifeless eyes, I knew the truth. I looked down at my hand. I stood there staring. My heart plummeted. I felt weak in the knees. My head felt ready to explode and my stomach heaved.
He was dead. I had killed him. My ears were ringing but the words repeated themselves over and over again in my head. I was gasping for air but no sound came from my open mouth. Everything. Every noise or sound disappeared. Except for him.
Something moved and my head swung to see Bucky. He had knocked his opponent out and was looking from me to the man to me. He began to walk to me.

No! Stay away! Stop! I screamed.

He reached out to my hand but I yanked it away before he could.

Don't touch me! I'm a monster! I screamed.

I began running. Alarms and lights went off but I couldn't hear them. All I saw was the man I had killed.
