Hey guys. How are you all doing?So I was not able to update today because I have no motivation or inspiration to write today, because I was #89 in fantasy now I'm really back. You know why because I have reads but hardly people vote, it's so rude, I'm really down now. If you read and like it please vote to keep writers inspiration and motivation on so that while writing I can know people are waiting to read something by me.
Please people you let me down. I'll update tomorrowÂ  :-(
