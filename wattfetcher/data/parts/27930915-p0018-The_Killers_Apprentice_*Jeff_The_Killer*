Jeff gives me a glare, rolls his eyes and nods. "Dress in-"
"Black. Got it." I finish his sentence for him and rush to my room. I change into the black clothes that Jeff had bought me. Not much, just a couple t-shirts and jeans, but it was enough. I walk back into Jeff's room.
"Can I ask you something?" I ask him.
"You're going to ask regardless of my permission."  Jeff chuckles.
"Have you ever had a girlfriend before?"
"That's a very seventh grade question." Jeff teases. "But if you must know, no. I've never had a girlfriend. Serial killer isn't exactly an attractive title. Trust me, i'm no virgin, but i've never been in a relationship."
My eyes widen. "By that do you mean you rap-"
"Oh god, no Lena! I'm not a fucking rapist. The sex was consentual. But they were one night stands." He explains.
"Oh." I nod.
"Maybe, uh, that was too much information."  He scratches the back of his head. "How about you? You've ever had a boyfriend? Or, er, girlfriend?"
"One." I shrug. "Just one, all through high school. When we graduated, he broke it off because I wasn't going to college. And he was going to Yale. He said we were 'different people at different intellectual levels'" I use my fingers to make air quotes. "He basically dumped me because I'm stupid."
"Woah. Sorry Lena." Jeff apologizes.
I shrug. "How old are you, by the way?" I ask him.
"Twenty-four. You?" He asks, zipping up his backpack.
"Twenty." I respond.
He nods. "So, you ready to go?"
"Yeah, let's go."
Jeff pulls out his knife as we walk out of the underground house.
