"OK Mr. Mohammed, can you stop talking to Ms. Nicholson and focus on what I'm teaching please?"
"Yeah,right,sorry, I'll pay attention now." He said totally not embarrassed. This boy can totally keep cool.
"OK class, take out you books and copy down this formula and then come up to my desk for your worksheets."
"OK " the whole classed chorused.
"Oh shit!!" I said out loud.
"What's wrong" Antonio asked, concerned. A few heads turned in my direction and stared at me like I was crazy.
"I kinda forgot my pencilcase at home, I have nothing to write with now. Damn my forgetfulness!"
"Oh don't worry, I'll  lend you a pencil." He said smiling.
"Ok thanks," I said, smiling back at him.We then kind of stared at each other for a few seconds before I broke the stares and looked at my book.
"We should probably copy down the formula now" I said blushing. What?? I never blush
"Yeah, we probably should" Antonio said, sounding disappointed.
"K I'm done I'm gonna go for a worksheet now."
As I got up, I felt someone grab my hand.I turned to the side to see Antonio's hand on my wrist.
"What's...........up??" I asked cluelessly.
"You stay here, let me go for the worksheets." He said kindly with a smile on his face. That boy is always smiling. Is it possible I'm making him smile?? I really don't know.
He came back with two worksheets and placed one in front of me.
"Your worksheet m'lady," He said playfully.
"Thank you, my kind sir," I replied back playfully and we both laughed at this.
I'll NEVER forget this day.ever.
