I wake to my mom's voice shouting for me to get out of bed for the millionth time that day. "Get up Renae," she says. "Your going to be late!" late for what? I think to myself , then I remember ,the Test! The test is when they scan mybody to see if I have anything wrong with me. My mom told me that the test is worthless and does nothing to help the people in our flate. (In the book a flate is a community) But every few years you notice that some people are gone and that they have switched flates. My brother told me that if you have some sort of talent that normal people don't have, the test picks it up, and you get sent to another flate. He knows this because it happened to his friend Eric, and soon after he left for the same reason. He only got a few minutes to tell us this before he left. My brothers name is Caleb, and the day he left I was heart broken.I get up and out of bed and get dressed then I brush my teeth. I just about wiped makeup on my face when I remember, the test won't allow make up because it messes up the scanner. I sigh and comb my blonde hair. Then I walk downstairs. I skip breakfast like every morning, get my shoes on, and grab my bag. "Mom I'm ready! Let's go," I yelled. Then my tells me to get in the car and we are on our way. My thoughts go back to when Caleb left us after his test. I wonder if I will have to leave like he did or if i will stay. I love it here, I don't want to leave, but it would me nice to move for a change, I have never lived in any other place then here. We pull up and I get out of the car. "Be brave" my mom tells me. "I will," I say back as I enter the building.
