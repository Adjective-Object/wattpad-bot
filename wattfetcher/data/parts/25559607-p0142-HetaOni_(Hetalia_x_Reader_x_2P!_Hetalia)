We were brought upon this world because of the wars. All our lives, we were all so focused on the hate, violence, deaths and madness.....that we never knew the other side of this world.


We never knew that....beautiful things could be made in this world, too.



~~~ "Would you...like to be friends, Ollie?"~~~



Upon remembering those beautiful words, Oliver broke down into tears.



"......W-Why....? Why now....? If....If only.....I.... If only we weren't in this blasted mansion....maybe....maybe it would have worked...out...better....maybe...." he cried out in between his sobs.


After a several moments of bitter weeping, the strawberry blonde haired man tried wiping the tears away and regain some of his composure back.


He ran his fingers through his hair and thought out loud, "......Maybe....it isn't too late....? Right.... Maybe....I could---"


Suddenly, the door behind him slams open.


".....You let her escape." a man said darkly.


Oliver turned around to see Lutz and Kuro entering the room.


The blue-eyed, strawberry blonde haired man was a bit taken aback by their statement, but he wanted to talk to them about something.


"I-I'm sorry I let the poppet out....but.... Listen, I think we shou---ooof!!" Oliver was cut off when Lutz suddenly punched the poor Brit in the stomach, causing the former to fall down to the floor.


Clutching his pained stomach, Oliver was about to look up when Kuro harshly pulled his locks to face him. "......Who gave you the right to ruin our plans?" the Japanese man asked as if his voice was tainted with venom.


The Brit tried to fight back to get away from the man, but Kuro was so enraged, he didn't let his grip off him.


"No. Wait, you have to hear me out. Please, I---" Oliver tried to reason, but he was only thrown backwards, his back hitting the wall.
