"What are you doing?" Simon caught my hand, "You're hurting me" I pulled my hand away, "What are you doing with those guys?" He asked as I was standing with Max and David in the mall, "Those are my new friends, I met them 5 minutes ago" I explained, "Let's go home" Simon pulled me to his car, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" I shouted, "You're the one doing everything wrong? Did you get you brain washed ? What happened to you? Now you're making friends too? Male friends ! You don't know what those jerks are thinking of" He scolded me with hisÂ  beautiful eyes that were no longer beautiful or soft, "You're not my father" I said and headed to my car, "Listen to me ! You either stop this attitude or else-" I cut him off with a long kiss, "I'm still angry though" He tried to keep his angry face on but he couldn't handle my puppy face.

Few days later :
"Please stay, I'm afraid" I tried to convince Simon to stay the night, "No, I can't, I shouldn't" He was sweating while looking at my tight leggings and shot blouse, "Let's go out then, I don't feel like sleeping".
We ended up in a fancy club, dancing and laughing. "I want to dring" I chuckled, "What? No !" But Simon couldn't stop me.
The last thing I remembered was drinkig more than 9 shots of vodka and some whiskey.
I woke up next day, in a bed, covered with blankets, I looked at my right, saw a head, looking at me with concern and regret, "Simon ! What happened? Did we ..?" I freaked out.
"I'm sorry" Simon rubbed his face in regret.

Our life is full of mistakes because we're not perfect, but there are some mistakes that change our lives forever.
