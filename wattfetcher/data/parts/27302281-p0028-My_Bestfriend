Justin POV
Oh man this hurts I thought holding my manhood   and flopping on the bed   then I stood up and cleaning  the room and remembered last nights agruement  maybe I should tell her the truth about selena ...Nah  she can't know I might lose her for good I got up well ..time to  see if she's done my mom should be home from work now
" kylie ready to go " I yelled I waited for a few minutes
" yeah let me grab my shoes" she  yelled back
I slid on my shoes and fixed my self in the mirror
You need to tell her
No I don't  what she doesn't know won't hurt her ok
Well when she finds out
Shes not gonna find out cause selena won't rat me out
You will see
God my  conscious annoying as hell  Kylie isn't gonna find out cause I'm not telling her
" I'm ready " kylie said smiling and kissing me softly
" Leggo" I said  with a goofy smile
" your such a dork " kylie said rolling her eyes
" I'm your dork " I said joked
Not if you don't tell her about selena
God your annoying
Just doing my job
Shut up
I looked over at kylie I could see she was nervous
" don't be nervous "  I assured her climbing in the drivers seat
"  what if she doesn't like me "  kylie said worried
" don't worry  I know she's gonna love you  cause I do " I  said squeezing her hand tightly
" ok " she said loosening up  a bit
The rest of the ride was silent
Better get used to the  silence cause once she finds out there will be a lot of it
I thought your supposed to say nice things
I'm not a lier that's your bad conscious for I am good
Whatever
" we are here" I told kylie pulling in the driveway
