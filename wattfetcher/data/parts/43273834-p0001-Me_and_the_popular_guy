"Katherine time to get up""Ugh mom I don't want to go to a new school"My mom starts walking up the stairs "you have to Katherine""Alright I will go"After and hour I straighten my hair and did my makeup. I get in the car and headed to school. I am 16 so I can drive myself to school with my friend Kenna. We get to school and I go to my locker. I look over and I can already tell who is the popular guys. He has all the girls around him. He looks at me but then I look away. I here the heel ring.
"Good morning class, in this class you will be learning about you US history"I look over and I see the popular guy again. The teacher starts calling out names and I here his."Chris you here""Yes""Katherine you here""Yes"Chris look over at me and I think he was trying to say nice name but I look away. If there is one thing that bugs me the most is that I am not the popular and I am shy.-Lunch-I find Kenna and we seat together "Hey kenna""Hi Katherine"Both me and Kenna have the same classes after lunch witch is good."Who is that guy that is looking at you""I don't know his name is Chris""Well Chris is very interested in you Katherine""Yah"
