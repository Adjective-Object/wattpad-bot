I moved in closer until our lips brushed, "Obviously." I put a hand on the back of his head and drew him closer until our lips pressed together. "Thank you." I said once I pulled back an inch.
"For what?"
"Getting in trouble for me."
I didn't have to see him to know he was grinning at me. I felt his smile against my lips as he kissed me again. "But if you do something that idiotic again, I'll cuff you myself."
Jack hummed against my lips, "You make it sound appealing."
I kissed him several times and nudged my face against his neck again. I didn't think it was possible for him to pull me closer, but he did. I slid my leg between his and hooked my arms under his. His arms were around my shoulders and we lay a mess of tangled limbs.
He tilted his head slightly to leave a kiss on my temple and whisper goodnight.
I woke in almost the same position. Except now Jack's head was under my chin, but we were still tangled together. The sunlight spilled into the room and is no longer the darkness I fell asleep in.
My fingers found their way into Jack's hair, brushing through gently. I lowered my lips to the top of his head and left a small kiss. He sucked in a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
The sound of someone clearing their throat at the foot of the bed made Jack stiffen.
Oh no.
We turned at the same time to see Jack's mom hovering at the end of the bed with her hands behind her back.

Sorry for the out of whack indenting, Wattpad wouldn't let me indent the second half for some reason? I use word and then paste it over and I don't know, I tried for almost an hour and nothing worked.
Oh well.
I'm updating today because I won't be home all day tomorrow. I hope you enjoyed the chapter! :) Let me know what you think? I'm trying to speed things up so some action can happen
And not that kind of action, hahaha.
If there's a way to fix the indenting problem, I'll figure it out and fix it hopefully.
Have a good day or night, or both. :)
