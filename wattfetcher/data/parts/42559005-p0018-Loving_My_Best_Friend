"wooohooo!" i yell i pick up sabrina and spin her around. i set her down and get the bear. "here you go my lady!" i say.
she takes it,and hugs it, "thank you so much jack!" she says hugging me then kisses my cheek.
"want cotton candy?" i ask, she nods.
i buy us pink cotton candy and then we take it to the ferris wheel with us.
"its 9:50, so this is the last ride" i say. "okay" she says. we got in cary which is big by the way and we start going in circles slowly.
we are feeding each other cotton candy until its gone.
"oops!"i say dropping the plastic container the cotton candy was in,"jack! thats littering!" she says. "im a bad boy" i say smirking and winking.
she shoves me lightly. then the cart stops at the way top.
ok now is the time......"bri" she turns around . i pull out the necklace and she gasps , she puts her hand over her mouth.
"bri, we have been best friends for about 3 years and these years have been the best, i will never let anybody hurt you i will be your hero whenever you need me. i know we say we love each other but in a friendly way but.....sabrina i love you" i say.
"will you be my girlfriend?" she nodds her head and smiles with tears coming out of her eyes.
i put the necklace on her and she opens the locket its a picture of me and her looking at each other laughing this was back in 2012.
"jack....its beautiful" she says "just like you" i say, she turns around and looks at me with adoring eyes.
we lean in and our lips meet , god her lips are so soft. i lick her bottom lip and she opens her mouth a little bit.
we kiss passionately, then the ride starts moving, we pull apart and laugh.
this was honestly the best.night.ever.
