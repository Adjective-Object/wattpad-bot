I was soon enveloped in a BIG hug by Bonnie that was impossible to escape.
After TEN MINUTES of hugging he finally released me, and I gasped for breath.
"You're not a freak," Bonnie stated flatly, his tone deadly serious. "These people just don't know you so you shouldn't let them get to you enough to make you quit talking. I like you, and you can call me your friend from now on, whether you like it or not."
He looked at me for a response, apparently not getting that I was pretty sure I couldn't talk. I pulled out my english notebook and flipped to the last page I'd been writing on, the one I'd used for explaining to Freddy and Goldie. I pointed to a specific paragraph and Bonnie read it.

If I talked it wouldn't matter, my words would be forgotten and disregarded...I'm not even sure I know how to anymore. It's been a use it or lose it situation, I haven't tried to talk in almost two years. I'm sure I've lost it by now.
He looked at me with sorrow in his eyes, and the lunch bell rung.
"I want to sit with you at lunch," he said simply. "I'm new so you can show me to the lunchroom and sinceÂ  I'm assuming you sit alone I'll sit with you."
I slowly nodded, getting the feeling he wouldn't back off anytime soon.
He began pulling me towards the door once I gathered my stuff, "Let's go."
