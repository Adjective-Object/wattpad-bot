"This can't go on forever are we friends or enemies?!" I asked Riley. "Enemies!" She yelled then stormed off to class . Just then Jake came up to me and hugged me."I'm so sorry" "iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimmm sah sorry tuh too" "will you come live with me and your mom again?" He asked me. Ooh I bit my lip "I don't think so I kinda like living with Lucas so" . "OK well if you ever change your mind I'll be here for you even though I may never be your boyfriend again I'll always love you" just then the bell wrung and he walked to class. I stood In the middle of the halfway with my mouth wide open. ************************************At luch I wanted to make some friends because I had none besides Lucas and Jake. I saw a girl with curly hair covering her eyes and she was wearing glasses sitting at a table alone I hoped she was friendly. Then I ambled over to her table.
