maia ran as she heard the ear-splitting screech of the indominus rex that ran not too far behind them, she felt as if her lungs were going to collapse at any given moment. she took huge gulps of air, trying to continue running but her legs felt like jelly on the unsteady plains of the restricted area of bamboo rainforest. she wanted to stop running, she really did, but she knew all too well that she had to keep running. not just for bailee and billy. but for zach and gray as well. she knew that if zach weren't to survive, gray would be in so much pain, and she knew that if billy or bailee were to die that that would be the end of her. the end of maia clementine quinn. she looked at zach who looked at her and nodded, mentally telling maia to run faster. that the i-rex was closer than ever.
"run faster!" maia heard zach yell from beside her, she nodded but she knew all too well she couldn't continue on. for the sake of billy. zach got a hold of maia's left hand and ran faster, trying to escape the indominus rex and catch up to bailee who was running hot on gray's heels, they had a heads up after they had been the last ones to tag along on there way out of the 'RESTRICTED AREA' which was surrounded with a thick metal fence line. "no wonder" maia thought in anger at her stupidity.
"wait!" maia yelled, pulling her left hand out of zach's grasp. he looked at her as if she was insane. she knew who was far behind, and she didn't want to let him die alone. he meant too much to maia to just be gone and dead in two seconds from fault of a vicious-human-feasting monster. maia looked at zach as she continued to run, but slowing down this time, zach looked panicked for a moment as he tried to pull maia's hand, anything to get her to run faster. but all she did was shake head 'no' as she looked at him with teary eyes. zach gulped as he realized what she was trying to state.
"i have to wait for him!" maia yelled, voice cracking as she completely stopped running, zach reached for her arm but she pulled it away, "i have too! take care of bailee for me!" and with that she pushed zach to run farther away from her and in the direction that bailee and gray were heading towards. maia turned around and ran off to the fields where she knew all too well that her brother, and former bestfriend, (along with third-to-last of the only family she had) would be laying there, dead.
