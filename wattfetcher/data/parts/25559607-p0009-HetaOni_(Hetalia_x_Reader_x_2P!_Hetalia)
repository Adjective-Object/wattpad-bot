I went back to the fortress where Germany is located.
J: Wha...? Was that door here before? Or is it just my imagination? I'm sure it wasn't an iron door, though...
Japan then knocks on the now iron door.
Japan: Uhm...Germany, do you have a minute?
Germany: Is that you, Japan? What's the matter?
J: You see, there's a mysterious mochi stuck in a wall in a room on the fourth floor. I feel a little sorry for it, so I was wondering if you could get it out...
G: I see. Okay, I'll go and get it out. I just have one favour to ask you, though.
J: Sure, if it's something I can do.
G: You see, when I was running, I dropped my whip. I think we should have some kind of weapon in case that THING shows up again. If it's not too much trouble, could you please look for it?
Lol. A whip. *coughhowkinkycough*
J: What a coincidence! Actually, I found your whip a while ago!
G: ...Oh.
J: Wait, I'll pass it to you.
It was lying on the bed next door.
G: Oh, I... see... Ahem... Thank you.
J: Not at all. I only found it by chance, after all. Now let's go to the fourth f--
G: Ah! Japan!! I'm sorry, but...
J: Yes? What is it?
G: Ah... I'm really, really sorry, but...
Actually, I'm hungry too. Don't you have anything for me to eat?
J: To eat... I'm sorry, but I didn't bring any food with me. I don't have anything that could be used as an ingredient either...
G: I see! So, if it's not too much trouble, could you please go look for something to eat?
WAT. DOITSU. This is really getting weird. I mean, Germany...asking for something obviously impossible. I mean, I know the toilet sells food because I've played this game before but... seriously?
J: Wh... Whaaaaaaaat?!
Th... That's impossible! How could I possibly find any food in this place?!
G: Please! I have no strength right now. Anything is fine; just find me something, okay?
J: ...........................
Haa....Alright. I'll take another look around. I also have to look for Italy anyway.
G: I see!! Thank you!! By the way, did you find my brother?
I giggled. No. I laughed. Why must my mind work like this? Hahaha. I mean, really... Germany asks for a whip, he asks Japan get something impossible to find in the house, and looks for his brother...not his brother and Italy. I know others will say that's not the case, but that's just me. Lol. Anywho...
J: No... But he should be fine. Somehow.
G: Sorry for all the trouble. Oh! By the way, take this with you.
J: (A drink?! And beer, at that?!)
Ah, thank you very much. I'll be going then.
G: Okay, thanks.
Japan then goes to the first floor toilet area. One of the doors were open, so obviously it needs to be checked out.
