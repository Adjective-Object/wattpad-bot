"Yeah."
"Well lets go."
He nodded and got up grabbing my hand.
"Where are you two going?" Tino asked.
"On a date, we'll be back later." I told him pulling Alan off the bus.
"Where are we going?"  Alan asked.
"Well since we're in Minnesota I'm taking you to the Yacht Club."
"What the fuck is the Yacht Club?" He asked.
"Its a restaurant and then I got a little boat ride for us down the Mississippi river."
"Oh how cute."
"Yeah I thought it would be fun. I haven't been here in a while so."
"Sounds great! I can't wait." He said smiling.
"I hope you like it."
"I bet I will,"  He said kissing my cheek.
I smiled before taking my phone out and calling a taxi.  Not long after a taxi pulled up and the two of us climbed in.  The drive wasn't too long to the Yacht Club and once we got there we walked in.
"Reservation for Carlile."
"Right this way." The Maitre'd said and led us to a table.
"This place is really nice Austin."
"Only the best for you." I said giving him a cheeky smile.
He just giggled in response and gave me another smile  when I pulled his chair out for him.
"And you're being a gentleman, how sweet." He said sitting down.
"I'm always a gentleman."
"When you're not being a cocky asshole."
"I'm not a cocky asshole."
"Sometimes you are." He said and stuck his tongue out at me.
I rolled my eyes at him, "Well if anything I'm a cute cocky asshole."
Alan hummed, "I would say you're sexy actually."
"Oh sexy? That's cute." I told him, "Is it because my big deal?"
"I swear to god you need to let that go." He said narrowing his eyes.
"Oh no, I'm not letting you live that one down."
"Why not?" He whined, "It's so embarrassing!"
"I know it is, but you're my boyfriend so I have to embarrass you one way or another."
"But not like that,and you embarrass me a lot."
"I do not embarrass you a lot."
"What about you pulling me on stage? Or making me read fanfic to you?"
"Hey pulling you up on stage was an apology and you didn't have to come up. The reading fanfiction, I wouldn't have made you read it if you didn't make me come and read it with you."
"I did too have to go up there, if I didn't I would have looked like a dick. And as for the fanfic you're just mean!"
"Don't be like that. I liked having you on stage and dedicating one of my favorite songs to you."
"Well it was very sweet." He told me smiling, "And terrifying I don't know how you can go on stage in front of so many people like that."
