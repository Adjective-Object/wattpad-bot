I was lying in my bed, reading, when I heard my sister arguing with her boyfriend, David. I sighed, they were always arguing, they were probably the worst couple I knew. I put my book down and walked over to my sister's room. I could hear their argument from the hall.
"Celine you can't keep doing this, people will realise that you're lying to them" he complained
"Nobody's going to get hurt, it's only for a few more weeks. It will be all over soon" she replied.
"It's not going to be over, this will go on for much longer. We'll both suffer for this. I can't deal with it" he shouted, as he stormed out of the room, slamming the door.
Thankfully he didn't notice me listening to their conversation. I walked into Celine's room.
"What were you and David arguing about?" I asked
"What do you mean, we weren't arguing" replied Celine, suspiciously
"Celine, I could hear you, you were definitely arguing. What's going on?"
"I said we weren't arguing, Sydney! Anyway it's none of your business, just get out!" She shouted
I was slightly shocked at her reaction. What was she hiding? Why was she so defensive?
A/N: So this is the first chapter. I know it's short and boring, but this will lead up to something good, I promise. I'm going to leave a short Author's Note at the end of most chapters, sort of explaining the confusing things. So this chapter was all about how Celine and David are hiding something, and Sydney is curious as to what it is. Please read the next few chapters. I hope you like it!
