Hiro and Tadashi wrote later that night to Aunt Cass saying how their performances went and wished that she would be there. Luna sat on the window sill at the girl's dormitories blushing so much and Rosa was at the Hufflepuff Common Room with Albert E. We missed you so much, Aunt Cass. Hiro and Tadashi thought when they went to bed.I miss you boys. Aunt Cass thought.
Sorry that took me long but I was busy with school so yay! Give a thumbs up
