Erin's POV
Since I'm staying at Jordan's for a while, we desided to make so competitive videos. We made a "fortress fallout" video and another "Shape up". Jordan won "fortress fallout" but I won "Shape up", even though I sucked at "Shape up" because of my cast.
"Good job." He said while lying breathless on the floor from "Shape up".
"Thanks." I said while exhaling.
He stood up and we ended the video. He kissed me before turning off the camera and realized...
"That... will be kind hard to edit out." He said.
"Yeah we kind of went "Bye" kiss." I said quickly.
"Oops." He said.
We checked the ending footage to see and desided to leave it in, it was way to close to edit out without making it look weird.
"I don't want to leave it in." I complained.
"It doesn't look good, it looks like we're trying to hide it too much." He said.
"Sorry, it does." I said looking at the ground.
"I hope they don't freak out over it." He said.
"We need to get rid of it." I said.
"Yeah, you're right."
We tried our hardest too get rid of it but we couldn't make it look right.
"I give up, we have to leave it in." He said.
"Okay." I said.
"At least they know we're together, and it wasn't a real kiss kiss." He said.
"Yeah, at least we didn't like start making out or something... ha ha."
"Wow... wow yeah." He responded sarcastically.
"What?" I asked.
"I -- never mind." He said.
"Jordan! Weren't we just over this? You can't start to say something and then not finish it!" I said.
"Jesus, I would have made out with you if the camera were off, I was making fun of myself... somehow." He said.
"Me too." I said looking at the video on the monitor.
"You too cute, how did I get someone like you?" He asked.
"Oh, Jordan." I said.
Jordan's POV
The video we took ended with us kissing and we tried to get rid of it but we couldn't and still can't.
"I love you." I said.
"I love... you." She said.
"Do you remember... the first time we said that to each other?" I asked.
"Yeah, you said it first." She said.
"I said it twice before you did." I said.
"When?" She asked.
~~~Flashback to the first time he said it~~~
"I love you." I muttered under my breath without her hearing.
We almost kissed but she got a phone call and denied it to kiss me but I turned away too soon and she kissed half my cheek half my ear.
"Oh god!" she exclaimed.
"I need you, Erin." I said with confidence.
~~~Flash forward to real time~~
