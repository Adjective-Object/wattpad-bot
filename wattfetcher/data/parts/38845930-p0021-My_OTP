Jordan's POV
Erin and I saw so much positive feedback after we uploaded the video that she cried again, so many tears.
"They are so sweet." She said.
"Yeah, I guess they are." I said.
She was so conflicted with joy, sadness and anger, so much that she even cried over that. She's gonna need a boat to leave.
"Jesus, Erin." I said when she started to cry again.
"What, I can't cry? Huh?" She asked.
"No, you can cry. You're crying so much that it's making me feel bad too." I said.
"Sorry, I am crying to much." She said.
"No, you're fine." I said.
"I am not, Jordan! I shouldn't cry like an infant at everything." She said.
"You're just having a bad few days, it's okay." I said.
"I'm not a child." She snapped.
"Erin?" I asked.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you like that. I am so annoying." She said with slight growl.
"Ohh, my baby." I said as she grabbed my arm and snuggled up against it.
"You're my man." She said.
"I -- you're man? What?" I asked.
"You always know what to say to make me feel better, Jordan." She said in the most adorable way.
"I love you and your words." I said before she kissed me.
"I love you, Jordan." She said as we lied back on the couch and she grabbed and held the top of my hand.
Erin's POV
"Have you seen the really long comment about us?" Jordan asked.
"With boo?" I asked
"Yeah that one." He said.
"Aww, Jordan. You have a pretty awesome girl there. And she has I kid too, you can be a little family together. What if you guys got married? Would you move in with Aurey or would she and boo move in with you? Either way that would be super sweet you guys, Aww! You're so cute as a couple."Â  That commenter said.
