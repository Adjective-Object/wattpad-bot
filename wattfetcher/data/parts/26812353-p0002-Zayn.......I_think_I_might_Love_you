Me and My sis on the plane! Cant wait to see Bradford! Hey England here come the Smiths!!! ;*;*;*:P
My sister's Phone buzzed. I herd another phone buzz and i looked in the direction of Curly Shirly and Mr.Quiff. Curly was showin Quiff somethin on his phone than pointed to me. Quiff turned and I looked down at my phone but watched him out the corner of my eye I saw Quiff smirk. He took Curly's phone, typed something and handed it back to him. My phone vibrated and it was from Instagram. I opened the app and it was a comment from @CheekyHarry
@CheekyHarry: Lookin pretty good on that plane babe ;) ;* ;*
Ugh! Boys.
