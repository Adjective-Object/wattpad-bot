Hello! I'm just gonna start by saying this: I'm not that great of a writer. I will try to update regularly but please don't hate me if I don't ( nobody's going to read this anyway ). If you have any suggestions, don't be afraid to comment!
Also this was not my idea, I found it on Tumblr and decided to start a fanfiction based on the idea.
Here it goes!

Draco Malfoy had nobody.
Nobody forgave him. Nobody looked at things from his point of view. Nobody to support him. Nobody to be his friend.
Except for one person,
and that person was Luna Lovegood.
