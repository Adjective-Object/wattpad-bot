"...(Second Name)!" he cried, rushing towards the (h/c) haired girl.
The attack was too critical for the girl's body. Her breath was becoming heavy, too, but she was able to still move. Turning to the magenta-eyed Italian who knelt beside her, she spoke, "...Luci...you did it...It disappeared..."
"Yes...Yes, but that's not important! (Second Name), don't worry, I'll get you out of here as soon as we can and we're going to get you to the hospital and you will be alright! You'll...you'll be alright, si? Si. You'll..." Past Luciano quickly said, feeling his whole world shattering.
Unable to hold back her tears, Past (Name) shook her head. "I...I'm sorry, but..."
"No! No, (Second Name)...don't say you're sorry... It'll be fine...really. You will be-"
"....Luci...look at me." she told him.
With a tear stricken face, Past Luciano hesitantly met the girl's gaze.
"Luci....I have some things to say.
First, it was wrong to settle the score against the 1Ps by using this mansion.
Second, though you guys weren't the kind of people I expected to be close with...but I'm glad, really.
Next would be... Thank you. Thank you for everything. This wasn't the ideal setting I'd wished for us to meet...but right now, I think I wouldn't have it any other way.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I didn't help you guys out against the 1Ps. You understand that I can't do that, right? I'm sorry if I was more of a burden to you guys, too.
And I'm sorry...if...I have to leave so soon... even if I said that I didn't want to..." Past (Name) stopped, coughing out more blood.
"(Second Name), please...Please, you can't...No, not you...Anyone but you...." Past Luciano cried, not hiding his emotions anymore.
Blinking away the tears, Past (Name) spoke, "Hey now....don't cry... You know, in the Hetalia fandom...this isn't your character..."
"Do you think I care about that...? All I care about right now is you...damn it..." he sobbed. ".....Don't go and leave me all alone, (Second Name)...."
Fighting to get the feeling in her arm back, she slowly raised her hand to caress the Italian's cheek.
"....I'm so glad to have met you, Luciano Vargas."
With a smile, she slowly closed her eyes...and gave her last breath.
"(Second Name)?
....(Second...Name)...
No!....
No...you can't possibly be...." Past Luciano shook his head, tears continued to fall down his cheeks.
Lips trembling, he softly choked out , ".....Ti amo...."
