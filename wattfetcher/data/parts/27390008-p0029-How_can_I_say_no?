I was glad that all my luggage was carry ons. Johnny helped me take my things to his gate. I thought we would have to wait in line with everyone else but then Johnny reminded me he had a private jet. We boarded and I grabbed his hand. Johnny squeezed it and smiled reassuringly at me. I smiled back and closed my eyes. I felt the plane take off and soon we leveled out. Johnny and i slept most of the way after that. We were woken up by the plane descending. Once we landed, Johnny helped  me into a limo and we drove off to his house. I was bouncing in my seat with anticipation.

"Calm down. It's just a house." Johnny laughed. I smiled at him.

"Sure it's just a house. But it's our house. I'm living with the Johnny Depp. That's huge. And that's a huge step for us." I said. Johnny nodded.

"Yes it is. I actually thought that you would say no considering how big a step it is. But I'm glad you agreed to move in with me. I love you too much to be cities apart." Johnny said as he kissed my cheek. I blushed.

"I do too. But I still can't believe you asked me to. I mean come on! Since I've known you, you are the shyest person I've met. So why did you ask?" I questioned. Johnny blushed and looked out the window of the limo.

"Because it hit me that we wouldn't see each other for a long time. I thought if I let you leave, you'd cheat on me. I know you wouldn't. It's just.......It's happened before." Johnny whispered. I took his hand and intertwined our fingers.

"I wouldn't. If either of us should be worried about that, it's me. I mean you see beautiful women everyday. And I'm me. You'd surely find someone better looking than me and want her more." I said. Johnny looked at me.

"Don't you say that. You are you. And you are drop dead gorgeous. You put all those women to shame. I'll only love you. You and only you. For who you are." Johnny said. The limo stopped and Johnny got out. He held his hand out to me and I took it. I stepped out of the limo. I was met by bright sunlight. Johnny smiled as he led me to the door. I looked up at the house and gasped. It was beautiful. Johnny opened the door and held it open for me. I walked in and looked around. Johnny leaned against the doorway and smiled. I gazed around and took in everything. From the amazing staircase to the walls to the way that everything looked perfect. I smiled as I spun in a circle. Johnny laughed and walked up behind me. I had stopped spinning and Johnny hugged my waist from behind.

"It's amazing johnny. I can't believe this is your house." I said as I leaned back against him.

"But it's not my house." Johnny said. I smiled knowing what he would say. "It's our house. You live here too now. And now it's perfect. Absolutely perfect." He kissed my head. I sighed in content. "What's wrong?" Johnny asked. I shook my head.

"Nothing. And that's the truth. I'm just so happy to have a guy like you and to be living with him in his amazing house. You are by far the best thing that's ever happened to me." I said. I turned around so I was facing Johnny and wrapped my arms around his neck. Johnny smiled at me and I smiled back.

"So about your things....." Johnny started.

"Don't. I shared an apartment with Jessica. I can just ask her to send a few things over and sell the rest." I said. Johnny frowned.
