"Sooo..." Scott still hadn't really talked with Cindy about anything.
"Umm..." Cindy fiddled with the tablecloth a little.
Scott cleared his throat, but it made this situation even more awkward than it needed to be.
"Say somethin' already!" Chicken growled at them, but mostly to Scott.
"So, umm... How are you today?" Scott finally asked.
"I'm doing good... How about you?"
"The same..." Scott chuckled nervously.
This was really weird so far.
"They need some sha-music." Lightning suggested.
"Lightnin', you use your brain for once..." Chicken liked the sound of that. He then grabbed a radio and played some soothing music to make it more like a date.
"Nice music..." Cindy had a small smile.
"It sure is..." Scott smiled nervously. "Are you hungry?"
"Sure, I guess... I haven't eaten anything."
Chicken came as a waiter again. "Can I get youse anythin'?"
"Umm, I guess just give us the special," Scott shrugged. "If that's okay with you, 'Jade'."
"I guess..." Cindy stared at the floor.
"Comin' right up!" Chicken walked off.
"I can't believe it, Scott is pulling it off!" Mike gasped.
"Yeah, wonder who his practice date is..." Eddy looked around, then saw the. "Wait... Cindy!?"
"No way they got her to help..." Duncan stated. "Unless..."
"They know about the Discord fan fiction..." the group murmured.
"Not to mention a duck." Ed declared.
"Huh?" the group asked him.
"What?" Eddy asked.
"Umm..." June blinked.
"Who?" Ed asked them.
"Huh?" Mike asked.
"Umm..." Ed muttered.
"Ed?" Justine glanced to him.
"Why?" Ed smiled.
The group looked at him oddly.
"Anyway... What were we saying?" Jo asked.
"I forget." Dee Dee laughed.
Back to Scott and Cindy, the two were eating their dinner, Scott has to do one last thing .
"All right, the last thing ya need to do is walk her home." Chicken instructed.
"I can walk home by myself." Cindy frowned.
"Okay," Scott held Cindy's hand, taking her to her house. "We're almost there, Cindy... Just hold on there, Cindy... There you go, Cindy..." Instead of holding Cindy's hands, he was holding Lightning's hand.
"Boy Scott, you're a mess," Lightning scoffed. "But you did good."
"Not what I expected, but I think you're ready." Chicken added, smiling for his friend.
