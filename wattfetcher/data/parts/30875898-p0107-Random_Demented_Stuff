You're stronger than you could ever think
But you believe it's all because of me
You can't see your beauty and your strength
So you give all the credit away
Because each day,
We paint a picture on our wrists in red
We lie awake at night with thoughts of death in our head
And we cry each time with every tally that we add
And instead of counting sheeps, we count the scars that we have
We've got bracelets on our arms, and long sleeves pulled down
We'll plaster fake smiles on our mouths if anyone notices our frown
We're tired, but we hide our yawn
Our hearts might be broken but...
We keep marching on, we keep marching on, we keep marching on
You sit alone, because you pushed away your friends
You didn't want them to be in pain, when your life ends
You wish somebody would see the scars along your wrist
But you get scared, so you move the cuts to your hips
Because each day,
We paint a picture on our wrists in red
We lie awake at night with thoughts of death in our head
And we cry each time with every tally that we add
And instead of counting sheeps, we count the scars that we have
We've got bracelets on our arms, and long sleeves pulled down
We'll plaster fake smiles on our mouths if anyone notices our frown
We're tired, but we hide our yawn
Our hearts might be broken but...
We keep marching on, we keep marching on, we keep marching on
Oh, can't you see that you are perfect
That mirrors so twisted, telling you that your not worth it
You see the world in a dimmer light
You find your flaws, you list them out before you fall asleep every night
Oh, you shake, and you scream
You get scared, and you cry
You panick, but you're stuck in your own mind
You would trade your soul, just for death to claim you
You say that you'd do anything, for us to stop caring about you
Oh, you've been through hell on this earth, and faced it with a smile
You've been saying that you're fine, lying to yourself for quite a while
You've got bruises on your body, and even more on your soul
Bullied and beaten every night, but you won't let go
No, you never let go
Honey, every word you say simply astounds me
We both know you've been through some tough times
But I promise I won't leave
I know it's hard to not give in, the pain always wants to stay
But keep marching, we know you can do it
You're getting stronger every day
