Once I was done I directed my gaze towards the man from before and watched as he headed towards the door. I however cut him off. "Really now is that really all there is to all that tough talk you were saying only seconds ago."  I slowly began to walk towards him and then he did the one thing the others didn't. He stood up and faced his death. All the others begged for their lives.
"I may be no match for you but I will not fall like some pathic sheep. If I die I die with my honor and pride intact." He said as he rushed towards me. I sent my hand straight through his chest and pulled out his still beating heart. I crushed it in the palm of my hands and watched as his body fell to the ground.
"You were right about one thing at least. You aren't a match for me no human is or ever will a match for me. It seems that o was also right about something. You did meet the same fate as the others did. You just met yours differently." I then made my way back to my now shattered throne.
I looked to the ground and saw the looked at the blood that covered the floor. Damnit this was going to be hard to clean. "Maybe the local villagers need a reminder of why they feared me in the first place." I walked to a storage room I had and a got one stack. I went to the warrior and removed his head and stuffed it inside the sack.
When I got there I found most of them in the bar celebrating my "death". Oh yeah this was going to be fun for me. I walked in and instantly all eyes were on me. "So who's idea was it to to get that overblown warrior to kill me?"
"What did you do with sir Williams?" I heard a male voice reply. I reached into the sack I had brought with me and pulled out his head and threw it on the ground.
"Now let's try this again. Who. Hired. This. Man. To. Try. And. Kill. Me." No response well then I was right this was going to be a fun night. Well fun for me at least.
