My parents are always dragging me into these parties with a bunch of our family friends. Let me rephrase. My parents are always dragging me into these parties with a bunch of THEIR family friends. The people there are either adults or in elementary school. So, there is no point of ME going. Although, when I go, I bring along a purse with a bag of chips, my phone and a pair of headphones. But, guess what?! I CANT EVEN SIT IN THE CORNER AND WATCH NETFLIX! Apparently I need to "talk to others" or "play with the kids". First of all, who do I talk to and who do I "play" with. I hope they remember that I am a fourteen-year-old because there is no one I can have an "actual" conversation with.
I actually tried to have a conversation with my mom's friends. It was not that bad AT FIRST. But then they start to bring up topics like puberty and if I have friends or not. Like seriously?! Oh but wait! It doesn't stop there. They also ask me how much I weigh. All they need to know is that I am a tall scrawny girl who eats a lot but gains no weight.
After my attempt to talk to the "moms", I walk over to my dad's friends. However, that decision was even worse. All they care about are my grades. And my grades are a whole new chapter(literally).
I had almost given up, but a cute little girl walked over to me and asked me to play with her. She had short brown hair, rosy cheeks, gray eyes, and a cute little smile. Her name was Kira. She held my hand and walked me over to her room. I walked in and saw a set of dolls neatly arranged on her shelf. You can guess what happens after that.
