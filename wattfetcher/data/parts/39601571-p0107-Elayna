I'm having writers block with anxiety so I'm not going to update :(
Someone said I should write about eating disorders, but that's not what the book is about.
It's about my anxiety story.And I don't know what you guys want to know about my anxiety so. yeah.
Maybe comment down questions here you want to know?Or inbox me if its personal to you?I could do like a q&a about my anxiety maybe?
Idk comment questions if you have them :)
