England nodded. "Hmm, is that so? Well, then, let's break it. We've got to fix time, anyway."
"Oh... b-but... I don't..." America frowned and looked away.
England rolled up his sleeves a bit and took a step back. "All right. I'll break it."
Using his magic, he broke the clock, making time go into another standstill for me--but another event for them.........or so I thought.
I couldn't understand why or how...because this doesn't usually happen to me...and by this.... I mean me.... seeing an event with them together. Not as just seeing it through a game screen like I used to.... but personally...in the flesh.

(((VISION/MEMORY)))

It was the room across the fireplace room. Many people were scattered about, but they were all there: Italy, Germany, Prussia, France, America, Japan, England...and a really large Steve creature that looked like it took steroids or something.
(("What on Earth?!" Present-timeloop Japan exclaimed.))
Past England rushed over to the Northern Italian who stood in front of the creature. "Shit!! Run, Italy!!!"
"Move... Please!! Go!" Past France choked out.
Past Italy shook his head vigorously. "I... can't... If I move from here... America will..."

(("That's the enemy that Italy fought on his own! But everyone is seriously injured! And why am I standing here and watching?" Japan frantically thought.))
(("This is horrible... What the hell? Even with so many of us fighting together, we still can't defeat it?!" I heard someone say out loud.))
((Japan turned to his right and saw his blonde haired blue eyed friend "America?!"))
(("I'm over here, too." I called out from behind them, startling them both.))
((America looked at us both and exclaimed, "Japan?! (Name)?! Huh, you guys are there? You guys were the ones talking just now, right?"))
(("Y-yes. Anyway, we have to help Italy!" Japan urged us.))
((I shook my head, as did America. "I don't think that's possible." the American told him.
Stepping a bit closer to a bookshelf, I attempted to pick up a book but my hand just passed through the objects. "I'm sorry but...We're transparent... See? We can't even touch anything. We're only supposed to watch quietly." I informed Japan.))
(("Oh, no!!" Japan cried helplessly.))
Past Prussia started limping closer to the others. "Shit!! My leg... is broken... ugh...!Move!!! Please, move!!!" he pleaded.
"Italy!!!" Past Germany cried out to his dear friend.

The Steroid Steve creature lunched towards Past Italy, but the Northern Italian gave a critical attack on the monster.
"... Its weakness...
is its forehead...
Too... bad. I win again..." Past Italy said, coughing out a bit of blood.

The monster disappears as it got defeated. Italy then turned to his comrades.
