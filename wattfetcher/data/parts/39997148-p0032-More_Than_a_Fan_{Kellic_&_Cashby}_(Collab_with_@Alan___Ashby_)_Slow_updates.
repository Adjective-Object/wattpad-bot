"How was the merch table tonight?" Mike asked.
"Crazy, and Vic was no help whatsoever." He said and glared at me playfully.
"He never is helpful."
"Yes I am!" I whined, "I help all the time."
"He carried a box and that's about it."
"I carried two boxes thank you."
"That's it."
"Is not, I tried to help but you guys were all over the place and fans wanted me to take pictures with them."
"He  sucked at it anyway."
I laughed, "Yeah I'm not cut out for managing a merch table."
"Mostly because you suck at math." Tony said.
"No I don't!"
"Yes you do." Mike said, "You barely passed it in high school."
"Oh that's great coming from someone who barely graduated."
"But I did graduate!"
"And I passed math in high school!"
"Barely."
"And you barely graduated."
"Sibling bickering, it never stops." Jaime said shaking his head.
"Guys don't we have an off day tomorrow?" Tony asked.
"I think so why?" I asked crinkling my nose.
"What city are we in then?"
"Branson, Missouri  I think."
"We should all hang out and have a campfire or something. Wouldn't it be fun?"
MIke nodded, "Yeah that sounds pretty cool, we should do it."
"It'll be a chill party, not crazy."
"Dammit." He muttered.
"It'll probably be crazy but they always start out chill."
"Exactly, it'll be great." Mike said.
"Hey Vic do you think you and Kellin could go buy all the supplies we'd need tomorrow?" Jaime asked.
I glared at him, "Sure."
"Even th-"
"No you can talk to Tino and Phil about that. I'm not buying it or supplying it."
"Fine."
"Fine."
"We'll get a list of everything you two will need." Jaime told me and I nodded.
"Fine with me." I looked over at Kellin, "Sound good to you?" I asked and he blushed nodding a little.
"Yeah it's cool with me, I mean we'll have a lot of fun." He said excitedly, "But I need to head to bed I'm exhausted." He told us and got up saying goodnight.
"Night!" We all yelled and once he was back in the bunks I glared at the guys.
"Thanks a lot assholes."
Jaime smirked, "It's going to be fantastic."
That's one way to put it.
