"You stupid child. You don't have a choice. If you don't help me I stick you in a container and I ship your ass off to Asia where you'll be traficked. Hear me, wither you help me or you die with shame. Which we both know in this family is not a good thing to die of" he told me. Before I could reply I heard a bang sound and then shooting. I fell off the chair and ducked for cover. I moved over to where I saw broken shards of glass and cut the ziptie loose. When I was free I got up and started heading towards the door when I felt a hand grab me and pull me back. I fell to the ground and scraped my hand. Before I could do anything I was grabbed from behind and dragged out of the door.
"You think you could get away from me that easily you stupid bitch. You're mine now" my dad's brother said and I felt something sharp go into my arm. I looked down and saw a syringe and I suddenly felt weak. Before I lost consiousness I made eye contact with Uncle Steve.
"Uncle Steve!" I yelled but all it sounded like was a weak cry, and then everything went black.
