Only a few seconds later did we hear a knock at the door. I went to go get the door when Chase walked out with his messy hair from laying in bed. "Come in" Chase said sounding a little grogy. "Uh, good to see you too?" Ryan let out a little awkward sounding laugh and walked in followed by Anna. Anna look at Chase and then looked at me, her eyes when wide. "What?" I mouthed to her. She mouthed back, "Your hair," she pointed to me, "and his hair!" "Is my hair a mess?" I mouthed as I started raking my fingers though my blonde curls. "It just looks disheveled" She mouthed. "Sorry if we, uh, interupted..something, I thought the text from Anna saying we were coming was enough." Ryan said rubbing the back of his neck. He looked awkward saying that. "Ryan, chill, we were watching a movie then got tired and almost fell asleep." Chase said running his hand through his hair then walking over to me and wrapping his right arm around my waist. "Ryan, it's time for these two to get home and get some rest - same for us."
Ryan walked Anna out of Chase's RV and they headed to my car when I started to walk out of the RV Chase caught my wrist. "Taylor," he pulled me closer to him and we were looking in eachother's eyes. "Your eyes are so pretty," he said as he leaned his forehead against mine. "Have a goodnight, I'll see you tomorrow." And he kissed my forehead.
He then picked me up bridal style and took me out of his RV. "Chase!" I giggled, "My clothes! They're still in there! My shirt and jeans!" "Don't worry, you can get them tomorrow!" He laughed and finally set me down on my feet, wrapped his right arm around my waist again and walked me to my car. "Chase, don't you want your jersey back?" "Nah, you can keep it. Don't even bring it back with you tomorrow." He said as he walked up to Anna and Ryan kissing. She had her back sunset my car and he had his arms wrapped around her waist. As soon as Chase cleared his throat a few seconds after finishing his sentence, the broke apart.
