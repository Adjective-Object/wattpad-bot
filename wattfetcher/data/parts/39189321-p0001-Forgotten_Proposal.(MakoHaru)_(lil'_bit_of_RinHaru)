HARU POVI sit in the cold water, waiting for Makoto to come pick me up. I hear footsteps on the stairs, so I bob my head under the water. "Haru? It's time to get out." Makoto stands above me, and reaches his hands out towards me. "Ohay≈ç Haru!" He pulls me out of the tub, gasping in disapproval. I look at him funny. "I've been doing this for more then 5 years Makoto. You should have gotten used to it by now." He smiles and chuckles. "I guess. Your more talkative then usual, why's that Haru?" I look at him, and raise my eyebrow. "Do you know what it is today?" I ask him as I grab my clothes. He grabs his phone to check what day it was, and puts it away slowly. "Is it a birthday?" I look at him with a look that would read 'seriously?!' He raises his brows at me. "What? Am I missing something important?" I grab his arm and pull him forward. He seems to get it, and leans in more. I turn my head, so he kisses my cheek. "It's not that? What is it then?" I then turn my head back and stare into his emerald eyes. "You seriously don't know?!! You. Don't. Remember?! ITS OUR ANNIVERSARY! THE THIRD YEAR WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER." I yell at him, and he looks at me, his eyes wide. I yelled. I never yell. I never do anything more then a mumble. Tears start to fall down my face. I feel them. Makoto goes to wipe them off, but I jerk away before he has the chance. "This is one year Haru. Why are you making such a big deal about it?" I turn away, and grab a duffel bag out of my closet. I quickly stuff my clothes into it. Makoto runs up behind me and I grab the bag and run towards the door. "Fine. Cry all you want. I don't care." I hear him yell. A little bang erupts from the floor and I see a box fall. I want to pick it up, but Makoto already has his hands on it. "Haru, is... is this why your so upset?" He opens it and reveals the engagement ring I bought. i sigh, the tears still running down my face. "Yes Makoto. This is the reason. I love you so much. So fricking much. And you just go and hurt me. I... I don't know anymore. I... have to go. Goodbye Makoto." I grab the box out of his hand, and run out the door, having no idea where I was going.
~TimeSkip~STILL HARU POVI sit on a fountain, trying to catch my breath. Makoto stopped following me a while ago. I grab my phone and text the only one that can help. Rin.~~~~~~~H. Um. Rin. I kinda need a place to stay. I remember you saying Ai is leaving for a while, and I was wondering if I could stay with you.
R. What happened? Yeah, you can stay, if you tell me what happened.
H. Makoto forgot about the Anniversary, and this was the year I was going to propose to him. I... don't know what to do anymore.
R. Swing by Samezuka, and I'll be waiting for you by the front door. ~~~~~~~I get on the train and arrive at Samezuka a little while after. Rin sits there, his eyes closed, and headphones over his ears. Anyone else would have thought he was sleeping, but I can see him twiddling his thumbs. he sees me approach. "Haru! Come with me. You must have skipped out on breakfast. I'll buy you lunch, how's that sound?" I nod. He grabs my stuff and pulls me into the school.
A/N. I feel quite accomplished. xD I never thought I would get this chapter done in one day. If you like it, I'll continue. Oh, and the chapter names will spell something, so that's why there's only one letter. ^_^ until next time, Strazzygal~
