"Cause I haven't heard that shit before."
"Not from me you haven't!"
"Yeah I know!" He said groaning.
"I knew this was just a waste of time." I muttered, "Just forget it, forget everything I said."
"Wait, wait. I don't want to do that."
"Well what do you want then? Because I'm not going to keep chasing after someone who doesn't want me."
"I-I want you but I can't."
"And why can't you?"
"Because I'm not here for a relationship Aust."
"Fine, whatever I'll just go then." I said and started to leave.
"No." He said grabbing my hand, "I- don't go."
I sighed and turned back to him, "Fine. What do you want?"
He bit his lip before looking at me, "Can we try this?"
I smiled, "Yeah we can try. That's all I've wanted."
He sighed, "Good."
I pulled him to me, "Does that mean I can kiss you now?" I asked.
"Yeah, for sure."
"Good 'cus I was going to anyways." I said and leaned down kissing him softly. He smiled into the kiss and wrapped his arms around my neck pulling me a little closer. Eventually we pulled apart and I smiled at him.
"Come on, it's getting late."
"Yeah, I have to do some picture stuff."
"Alright, well let's go then."
He nodded and held my hand as we walked to the bus. Once we got inside the guys all smiled at us.
"I see you two fixed everything?" Phil said.
"Yeah we did." I told them.
"That's good."
I nodded, "It is."
"Well I'm gonna head back to my bunk. I'll see you guys in the morning." Alan said before kissing my cheek and walking to his bunk.
I smiled and watched him walk away before taking a seat.
"Wow. What happened when you two talked? He practically hated you earlier." Aaron said.
"Well we talked, and I told him that I really do like him and I don't just want to get in his pants and then well he said he liked me back and said that we can try." I told him smiling happily.
"Well then I hope it works for you two.
"Thanks." I said, "I'm gonna get to bed I think."
"Okay night.
" Night." I got up and walked back to the bunks smiling a little more when I saw Alan. "Hey."
He looked up from his computer and smiled. "Hi. Are you going to bed?"
"Yeah,Night."  I said poking my head into his bunk and little farther, "See you in the morning."
He nodded and leaned over kissing me softly. I kissed back and smiled when he held my face in his hands.
"I could get used to that." He said pulling away.
I smiled, "I think I could too."
"Good, now get some sleep."
