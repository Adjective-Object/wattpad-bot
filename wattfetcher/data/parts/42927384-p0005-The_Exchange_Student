"Oh silly me, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Karma Ashcroft." Karma, what an extraordinary name."My name is Amy Raudenfeld." And now she's been put in a trance. Am I really doing this to her? Then she snaps out of it. "I'm sorry if I keep spacing out. I just really like the sound of your voice." I can feel the blood just rushing to my face. "T-thank you. I am from Russia so that explains my accent." I try to play cool and just laugh it off a little, but she just keeps staring at me in awe.
"Wow you're far away from home. So what brought you to the great America?" I want to tell her everything because I feel safe with her already but I should just wait til everything is stable.
