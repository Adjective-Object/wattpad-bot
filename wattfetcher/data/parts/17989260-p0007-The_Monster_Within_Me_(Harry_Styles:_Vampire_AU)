After transforming Niall, I decided to ditch school. I brought Niall with me so that when he wakes up, he won't be attacking any of our school mates. After a couple of hours, Niall was slowly waking up so I ran to his side waiting for his eyes to open. I just sat there beside him waiting until he suddenly stood up and growled loudly.
"Easy Niall, Calm down." I shouted while stopping him from growling and from moving too much.
He didn't stop. He just continued moving and growling which made me pretty angry.
"Niall!" I groaned but he replied by scratching my face leaving 2 long fresh wound on my face. That's when I losed my temper.
" NIALL JAMES HORAN!" I growled so loud that he stared at me.
"Trisha?" He mumbled. "Niall, are you feeling good?" I asked, my voice calming down.
"Yeah I am okay." He mumbled, still scared from my sudden outburst.
I went to the kitchen to get him some fresh blood. I was walking towards the living room when Niall suddenly groaned in pain.
"Make it stop Trisha, Make it stop!" He cried in pain while curling up into a ball.
"Niall, what's happening?" I gasped while kneeling beside him.
"My chest is killing me Trisha! My chest is burning!" He cried and groaned a lot more louder than the last one.
I checked his pulse and his heart rate was fast.
"Niall, I don't know how to make it stop but I promise that everything would be alright." I mumbled while staring at his pale face.
" Trisha, what's happening?" He whispered. " Hush Niall, just close your eyes and everything would be alright when you wake up. " I whispered, my voice shaking from being worried about what is happening to Niall. He simply nodded and closed his eyes slowly then he grasped my hand holding it tight.
"Everything would be okay." I whispered. He held my hand while I listened to his slow heartbeat. I felt his grip loosened and that's when I know that his heart stopped which means he either died or turned into a vampire. Now I gotta wait for him to wake up.
I decided to get some blood bags from the hospital not far from my house since Niall's a newborn which means he would a lot more blood than I normally do.
I'm lucky that I have a friend working at the hospital so that it would be a lot more easier for me to get some blood bag. I also compelled her to give me 30 blood bags a month so she's the reason why I am still alive, well not really alive but oh well.
After getting my monthly supplies of blood bags I decided to return home and check on Niall. As I opened the front door, I was greeted by things scattered everywhere, like literally everywhere. Books were scattered on the floor and everything was thrown away. That's when I finally realized something.
