Everything else in the house was silent. It had gotten late pretty fast. My room was dark except for the simple Christmas lights I hung up around my bed. The soft glow it gave seemed to calm me down a bit. I needed someone to talk to.
Although Jordan was normally the one I went to for advice I knew I couldn't. Not right away anyway. Reason being that the second I tell her, she'd freak out. She would want to meet him and want to know every detail.
I sighed. This was definitely NOT the start to summer I imagined. Before getting into bed I made sure to lock my door. I rested my chin on my hands as I starred out my window. The moon was partly covered by a cloud. Stars covered the dark sky making it look kinda magical in a way. If only the stars could grant wishes for real.
I always made a wish on the first star I saw. I believed that dumb saying Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight. If only that one wish came true.
I flopped back into my bed and snuggled deep under the covers. I prayed that this was all some weird, twisted dream and that when I woke tomorrow, the kid in the room next to me was gone. Hopefully when I woke up tomorrow, that would be the first day of summer. I laughed at myself for being so stupid. This wasn't a dream. No matter how badly I wanted it to be one.
