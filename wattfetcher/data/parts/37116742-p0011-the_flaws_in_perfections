If you have my trust your lucky
If you can keep it your special
If you've earned it your worth it
If you are careful with it you are wise
If you abuse it you are foolish
If you don't recognize it you are blind
If you lose it the game is over
If it's gone it will not return
When it's gone I go with it.
