They gathered together around the fire light, whispering and murmering. James watched from afar, he turned to Aurelie who was in a deep slumber. Her cuts and bruises healing underneath the tea leaves. The smell made you feel dizzy, James shook his head.
He was about to get up from his chair, when he saw Sirius Black looking at him. Sirius smirked. Pulling out an apple from his pocket, James just stared at his best friend.
" How are you here? There aren't any stones for you too come out off" asked James, Sirius just laughed. But the laugh sounded more like a bark. James just crossed his arms as his stare intensified on his childhood friend.
" She has three stones, but that's beside the point I don't know how I got here. Really one minute I was in heaven with all the chicks then next I'm here and taking an apple from the bowl" told Sirius.
" Just like me except you weren't trapped to a stone" informed James, Sirius grinned his eyes diverting over to a mirror. He wrinkled his nose at the sight off it.
" What is that thing? It looks as hideous as the mirror in my dearest mother house" snorted Sirius sarcastically. He shuddered as he felt a cold breeze, then yelped at the quick pain.
Sirius white t-shirt was turning red from blood, he pulled up his T-shirt. And there was the largest gash, it looked like an animal had slashed his stomach.
James swore under his breath, searching through the cupboards that could have been any help to them. When he had eventually forced Sirius into a seat he started applying to his cut with water. Sirius looked at the mirror and mumbled 'sorry' while staring in horror at the mirror. Shuffling as far away from it as possible.
Once James had securely wrapped the bandages around Sirius gash he grinned at his work. Then James paused and it dawned on him.How an earth is Sirius bleeding isn't he supposed to be dead?!
Sirius noticed James stare, he shrugged it off but then looking in the mirror he noticed something was off. He had no grey hair strands, his body looked strongly built. He turned back to James and demanded.
" what the hell is going on here?!" Asked a very bewildered Sirius.

Romnolous stared down at his people, a frown forming upon his face.
" we have the keeper here and her companion. She won't win this war without help!" Acknowledged Romnolous, his teeth clenching in frustration.
One of the younger girls who had long silver hair and eyes as white as the snow. She waved her hands around desperately wanting to speak. When she finally could she blurted out" why can't they fight their own battles? That's what you taught us?!"
Many adults chuckled around her, but she just frowned and crossed her arms. Huffing at the adults around her, making some littler children giggle and try to copy her movements.
" little one our lives are at stake here. We must defend our nation. The time is now! A storm is brewing in the horizon. A very dangerous one. We will fight for equality, for our freedom and our lives. And she will lead us, for she is our light! " Roared Romnolous as the crowed cheered.
