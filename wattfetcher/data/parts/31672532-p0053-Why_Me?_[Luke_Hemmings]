"But can I ask you something?" Really now?!
"Uh sure what is it?"
"Alex, I have liked you for so long and I need to get this off my chest."
"Luke what're you-" he cud me off.
"Alex will you be my g-girlfriend? You mean so much to me a-and I love it when you come over to eat and watch movies with me. You're the greatest cuddle buddy, better than Calum. Don't ask. You get me and you're helpful, kind, and-"
I cut Luke off by doing the most out-of-the-box thing I've ever done.
I kissed him.
