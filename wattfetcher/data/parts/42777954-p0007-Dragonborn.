They were into the beginning of the fourth week on the trail, it was Mondas of Heartfire and the air was cool all throughout the day and cold at night. Anson said that this was only because of the ash clouds that covered the sky, he told her that before the Red Mountain had erupted it would have been much warmer, hot even, up to Last Seed. They set up camp early that night; actually it was early afternoon when they stopped. They had mutually agreed that there was no point in pressing the horses to the point of exhaustion when no one was chasing them and they were on their own time. That wasn't to say that they didn't want to get to Skyrim as soon as they possibly could.
Mournhold was within sight as they set up camp and ash was built up in drifts around them like short walls. The guars were wandering around them in clumps of three or four, blatting annoyingly as they ambled around.
"Ugly creatures." Anson muttered, flinging a handful of dust at a couple that came too close to the encampment. He uncorked his bottle of brandy and took a pull of it, "I can't wait to get out of here. It never rains and there's barely anything for the horses to eat."
Katya nodded, they had made sure to bring provisions for the horses as well as themselves. There was very little graze in Morrowind, but they always made sure to scrounge up what they could when they set up camp, just to supplement what they had brought along. They were rationing the poor beasts and probably would be for another week or so.
"Lets just get some sleep so we can get out of here. I don't like being in the open like this." She sighed and stretched out on her bedroll, "I can't wait to be out of this horrible country. If I never see another Dunmer again it would be too soon. The bastards are so hostile, they act like everyone wants to rob them, or kill them. By the Nine its ridiculous."
"I agree wholeheartedly, but as it is we can only go as fast as we can go. The horses are exhausted and under-fed and the ash slows them down. I'll take first watch, you get some sleep."
"Thanks Anson." She threw one arm over her eyes and relaxed into her sleeping mat. If there was one good thing about the ash-lands, it was the softness that it lent the ground. Katya slept as if she were floating on a cloud that night waking a few hours later for her watch feeling more refreshed than she had in weeks.
"I feel disgusting." She remarked as they packed up their camp the next morning. "I saw a pool not far from here, it looked clear enough. I think I'll go take a little bit of a bath."
Anson snorted, "If you feel like it, not that it'll do you much good. You'll be coated in this wretched ash the moment you get out of there."
Katya waved her hand, "Whatever, at least I'll feel some semblance of clean. As it is I feel as filthy as a beggar." She shouldered her knapsack, "If I don't come back in thirty minutes I drowned."
"I knew Nords couldn't swim." Anson replied in a mock snide tone. Then he smiled, "If you don't come back in thirty minutes I'll come make sure some Cliff-Racer didn't do you in."
"Some Dark Elf is more like it." The girl replied, only half joking as she headed for the pool.
The water was cloudy and it smelled ever so slightly sulfuric, but when Katya had disrobed and slipped into the water, it was wonderful. Like a fresh drawn bath, just hot enough to relax road sore muscles, but not hot enough to scald her. She wanted to linger in the pool but logic overruled her desires. She scrubbed her skin until it stung, washing off weeks of sweat and dirt and lathering herself with a bar of lavender and lye soap she had purchased while they were near the Imperial City. The smell of sulfur was soon overpowered by the smell of flowers and she was soon very clean. Katya climbed out of the pool feeling satisfied as she sat on rock, combing out her hair as she waited for her skin to drip-dry. She combed back her hair patiently and then split the top layer, braiding it into two pieces and then tying the pieces together at the crown of the back of her skull. Katya slipped into her travel clothes and started out of the scant bushes. The young Nord didn't realize that she had been being watched until her stalkers sprung upon her from a small outcropping of rocks to the east.
