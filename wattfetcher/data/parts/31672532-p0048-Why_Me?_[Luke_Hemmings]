"Ugh okay but it's a long story."
"We got time." They say simultaneously.
Here goes nothing.
----------------------
"So do you like him? It's sounding like he likes you. Especially towards the 'soccer date' part with that guy." Trisha asks and seemed really intrigued. I tell them everything but the part of when we talked in his room about that.
"I mean I don't know but I can tell he's hurting but he won't tell me. But I do have strong feelings for him I just don't know if it's like that. You know?" I see the confusion or worry in their faces and then sympathy. God I can't even understand my own feelings! I placed my head in my hands and groan loud enough to hear a knock on the door.
"Is everything okay? It's 9:00 so be quiet and it's a school night okay?" Mrs. Stacy is like my second mom now. I talked to her while Judy and Trisha were fighting over the pizza toppings. So maybe she can help me!
"Wait before you go, can you give me some advice?" I ask as my cheeks heat up. I hate it when this happens 'cause I'm so awkward!
"Of course! What is it?"
I explain to her about Luke and I and she just nods and seems attentive.
"Well I think you should talk to him and go from there. You never know unless you ask him yourself. Now get some sleep you three okay?" We all nod and say our good nights and I plug my phone up and check to see a text from mom and Luke.
MOM: I love you and miss you! Be back Friday!
I smile and check to see what Luke sent me.
LUKE: We need to talk. tomorrow in the parking lot before school? X
I sigh and reply
ME: sure I'll be there and make sure to eat breakfast okay? :)
I always tell him to eat and normally he does so hopefully he's okay. Immediately I get a text from Luke and see him say;
LUKE: I'll try and hold it down goodnight gorgeous :)
And like that I set my alarm and made my makeshift bed on the floor next to Judy and fell asleep anxious for tomorrow.
