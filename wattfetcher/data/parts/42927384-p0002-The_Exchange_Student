Pain struck as current memories flood my brain. When you're famous you have to set a high standard of yourself. You have to do everything perfectly because just one screw up, just one tiny screw up, will shatter your world and burn it down to ashes. You've become one of their puppets, but you didn't ask for any of this to happen, you just wanted to be normal. What is the definition of normal? I'd ask myself but I just want to fit into a society. Your privacy is gone, your stories are sold everywhere and you're trapped in this world where you can't escape, can't breathe.
Breathe, I tell myself. My mother could see the pain in my eyes but she wouldn't dare ask about it. She knows what I'm feeling. She thinks that her silence would help. I need to go isolate myself and wash these memories away. I reach the restroom and lock it. I just splash cold water on myself making me wake up from a flashback nightmare. *Sigh*
I make my way back to my seat and plug in my earphones. Music really is a true best friend. I've finally had a chance to calm down and my mind wanders back to what life would be like in America.What's it going to be when I get there? What am I going to do while I'm here? Does anyone know who I am here? Will I ever find this so called "true love" that claims to exist? I question everything don't I?
