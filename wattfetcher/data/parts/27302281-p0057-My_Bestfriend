........................................Justin POV We got downstairs and Kylie's parents were downstairs and her dad eye balled us like he was checking to see if anything was off I shifted a little bit but kylie broke his gaze and he pulled her into his chest into a tight hug then smiled slightly then her mom came around them and pulled me into a hug and I hugged her back slightly and she releashed herself from me and I was face to face with every boy's nightmare and he was extending his hand to me to shake it I gripped his hand tightly and shook it and he raised an eyebrow and smiled
" nice handshake" he said giving me a straight face tell you the truth he still scares me even now
" yes sir " I gulped and Kylie nussled into my side for comfort which made me relax a little I pulled her closer to my chest and she looked up at me god she's beautiful her eyes are just hard to explain I get lost them everyday and her lips are perfection and her kisses are my own personal brand of heroin shes addictive she's my girlfriend and I wouldn't have it any other way
" Justin" she whispered crap I think she was talking to me
" yeah love " I answered snapping out of my thoughts
" my mom asked a question " she giggled up at me
" miss Braun I'm so very sorry I was lost in thought " I apologized

" your lovely daughter" I smiled which made Kylie blush like a lot and her parents awed and she covered her face as she blushed even more
" don't hide it you look beautiful " I whispered softly to her and she smiled
Her parents sat down and we watched some TV and talked a bit my mom heated them up some warm ups from earlier and they ate and currently my mom and kylies mom are fighting over who does the dishes hint just like me and Kylie and looked at Kylie and she was trying not to laugh and so was I Pattie ended up letting Kylie's mom wash the dishes and when she's was done they hugged Kylie and then hugged me then walked out the door.
