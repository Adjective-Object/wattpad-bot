"Just keep it with you until you change your mind" Jake placed it in my palm and left.
......
I heard a loud knock on my door, I was sitting on the couch and eating chips, "HOLD ON" I shouted then opened the door.
"What do you want? I'm busy" I shooed Simon off.
"I saw you and Jake today"
"So?"
"Don't obey! He's going to ruin you"
"Not more than you did"
"Please put that thing away, I'm trying to help"
"Oh really? Is that what you call help?"
"You should stay away from him and his crew, dont obey, dont try weed ! He'll lead you to something further"
"Thank you for the advice" I smirked and closed the door but he stopped me.
"What do you want now?" I raised an eyebrow.
"I came for another thing" And I thought that he was jealous and still worried about me.
"Quickly, because I'm about to miss my favorite show" I sighed.
"Try this" I gave me a bag.
"What is this ?" I raised an eyebrow.
"It's been almost a month since ... since we got drunk. This is a pregnancy test" He said, he was not kidding. My eyes widened, I didn't think about it.
"Just try it, we need to make sure"
"You really are a jerk" I shut the door and got back to my couch.
"But what if ..." I started wondering.
I opened the box, did the thing and called Simon.
"I'm still out your door" He said. I opened the door, stared at him right in the eye and showed him the test.

"Two lines" I said then exploaded in tears.
