So I wanted to write this along time ago but never did. So this is silly and crazy book. It's just about my feelings and thoughts. This is about the games I play only.
The games mentioned and characters are not my own. They belong under the category of Sony/playstation and Nintendo.
I've played many games in my 14years. This are my some of my favorites:•Jak and Daxter series (mostly Jak 2 cuz he was hot)•god of war(I like Kratos)•little big planet(my sackboy looks like Nathan Drake with big white glowing eyes)•uncharted (mostly uncharted 2 among thieves)•Mario (daisy and Luigi are the best)•sonic(shadow and knuckles)•kingdom hearts series (Riku and organization 13)•final fantasy series ( sephiroth and Reno and zack)
Now that I got that cleared up you will notice that I play a lot of games,have an Xbox but doesn't use it and play old consoles. I DONT like Xbox at all. I still play ps2. I also have all ps systems but one the vita. Sad right you have ps to ps4 but no vita so now my psp is without a sister.
I named the systems. Ps1 is Lara (Lara croft). Ps2 is Jak (Jak 2-I have all 5-). PS3 is kratos(one of the many sons of Zeus). Ps4 is Joel(the last of us). Wii is daisy (from Mario). Wii u is Luigi( from super Mario). Ds is savvy(style savvy1). Dsi is pinkly(I have the pink one). 3ds is Riku (dream drop distance). 2ds is tomo (tomo dachi life). 3ds xl is link(ocarina of time 3d). And game cube and game boy is Nina (as in Nintendo).
What kinda girl names a game system. THIS GIRL
