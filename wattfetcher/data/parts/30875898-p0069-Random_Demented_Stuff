I'm not a coward, I'm not afraid
This is all I've been thinking about, days upon days
You won't change my mind, you don't even care
Don't say you've been through the same thing, don't even dare
How many times have you been called an inhuman freak
Got pushed and shoved into a ten foot creek
When they know you can't swim, and they hope you drown
They hope you don't reach the surface, damn they hope you hit the ground
How many times have you cried for no reason
Get a scratch, keep picking, and picking, and picking the lesion
Have you ever been so tired of living that you just wanted to fucking die
Just wanted to shut yourself up so you can't hear yourself cry
And now your quiet, you don't know what to say
You've never felt this way, not ever in a day
I yell, "I bet you'd laugh if someone commited suicide!"
"Yeah, rather laugh with the crowd then an outcast and cry."
What's so funny about seeing someone die
Is it because of the blood, or the way they're laid out
Or is suicide just a funny fucking way to go out
Is it funny when you joke around, call her a bitch, says she's a cow
When she's hanging on a tree with a chain around her neck
When you call him a faggot, say he should go kill himself
And he takes a couple of pill bottle for the cabinet shelf
And he gobbles them down
Hey man why aren't you laughing, isn't it funny now
When you see the conflict in my eyes, someone has to die
You or me, I don't know, let's see
I put a bullet in the chamber, cock it, and put it to someone's head
One piercing sound then that person is dead
Everyone goes quiet, then they get loud
What, isn't it funny now
They're all cheering, "She's dead! She's dead!"
All because if what you said
And when you're watching me get buried six feet down
Ask yourself, "Why isn't it funny now?"
