~ Mason ~

I stood at the edge of the board, facing the water. It was clear as day, calm and peaceful. I turned around, my toes on the very edge of the board. I tried my hardest to remember everything my coach said prior to this meet. It was an important one. The top three move on to JOs. I needed to be one of them. I looked at my hands to make sure I had my older brother's lucky bracelet. Good. I had it. This was my hardest and least favorite dive, and I needed to perfect it to win. I put my arms out, balancing myself.
'Go for it,' I told myself. I took a deep breath and jumped off the board, feeling the breeze across my shoulders. It was exhilarating. I did my best to point my toes and keep my arms straight as I went through my inward one-and-a-half. Going into the water, I felt like a sharp needle going into somebody's skin.
"Mason Grey, inward one-and-a-half tuck, degree of difficulty, 2.2," The overly-cheery announcer said as I got out of the water. The judges were scoring my dive.
"Scores for Mason Grey," the announcer started. "8.5, 9, 9.5, 8," The she finished. Everybody clapped. I was pleased knowing that I got the highest scores on my worst dive.
"Nice job, Mason!" My coach's voice bellowed as he gave me a high five.
"Thanks, Phil," I said in return. Phil was a stereotypical diver. He was medium height with a nice set of abs and muscles. He didn't look a day over twenty five.
"I think those judges are crazy for not giving you a ten. That dive was practically perfect," my coach said.
"Oh, stop teasing me," I nudged him.
"Seriously. I think you may have made JOs with that dive," Phil said.
"Thanks. That means a lot," I responded. We smiled as he put his hand on my shoulder. However, our little moment was ruined when a cheery voice bellowed over everybody. The announcer.
"Beautiful job today, divers," she said. "Now, only three of you can go to JOs, but we have podium awards for the top eight highest scores," she continued. I took a deep breath, hoping to be on the podium, more importantly, in the top three.
"Go get em," Phil said, hugging me tightly.
"Thanks," I said, laughing and hugging him back. I then jogged over to the other end of the pool where awards were being handed out.
"All of you did wonderful today. But, only eight of you can be on the podium, more importantly, only three of you can make it to JOs," the announcer restated. "In eighth place with a score of........." The announcer started while I listened attentively, hoping not to hear my name until she got to the top three.
"Okay, everybody. This is the moment we've all been waiting for," the announcer said, making the atmosphere around us tense.
"In third place with a score of 330.7 (idk I'm just making this up), Savannah Wilson from Portland diving center," The announcer said as a petite girl with dirty blonde hair, my teammate and best friend, went up to her third place spot.
"In second place with a score of 333.8....." The announcer started. It was some girl from some team I had never heard of.
It's now or never. I either won, or didn't place at all.
"And in first place, with a grand total of 341.4 points....." I held my breath.
"Mason Grey from Portland diving center!" She exclaimed. I could barely breath from all the excitement. I went up to the podium for my first place medal. "Congratulations, everybody," the announcer said.
