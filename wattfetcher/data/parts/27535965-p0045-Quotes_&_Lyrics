"When you ask someone what they are doing, or reading; in example, look at the way their facial expressions change, look at their body language, listen to them, when they describe things. Listen to them when they describe the tragic car crash or the dog's death in the story. Listen to how they describe their favorite and least characters. Pay attention to the even "lowkey" details."
~ me
You realize so many things when you do it. A few months ago, a friend and I met a swiftie and she started rambling about tons of things. When the girl left, my friend whispered "well, she's kind of a creep," and I replied with, "not really, she just has a different way of expressing her love for something than you."
Ps. To keep something low key: to not announce it; to have a quiet gathering; opposite of a large party or big group of people; not much emphasis, closely aligned with a normal night out doing the usual stuff.
