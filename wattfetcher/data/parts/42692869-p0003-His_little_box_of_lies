I truly hope that Emil can truly find someone he will fall head over heels for. I'm a little sad, now that I think of it. Emil is the most perfect guy you can get, and the fact that he doesn't love me as much as he could, kinda hurts me. It's not that he doesn't love me that's hurting me. What is hurting me is that I can never have another guy like Emil. So thoughtful, so insightful, so caring to all the ones around him, not expecting any appreciation, any love, any compliments or rewards in return. But it wasn't my love that mattered at the moment. I felt as if Emil could do something better than me in the future, and I'm probably right.
I bless the guy who truly gets all of Emil's love.
