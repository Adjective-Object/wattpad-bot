Rachel's P.O.V.
When I said that Percy, Nico, and Thalia were the ones in the prophecy, Percy blacked out. Chiron asked me, "Are you sure, my dear?" while Annabeth and Jason ran to Percy to carry him to the infirmary. "Yes, I am completely sure that they are. Ground is Nico and it probably means underground like the underworld is underground. Sky is Thalia and it is because he father is the god of the sky. Percy is sea because he is the child of the sea. So when will they leave?" I said/asked. "Tomorrow at noon. Assuming Percy is awake. If not, we will see. Good day, campers." And with that, Chiron left. So I went to my cave. I had stopped crushing on Percy a long time ago, but I sometimes drew him. Lately I have been letting the Oracle take over what I draw. I had drawn a picture of Thalia tied to a rock in a cave with Percy and Nico saving her. That is one reason I knew that they were the ones in the quest. The other reason was that I drew them leaving Camp. Percy looked like he had just woken up from a coma or something. Thalia looked like she was bored and wished to be back with the hunters and Nico had no expression at all. Just like normal. I was kind of scared. I don't know why. But I knew that Percy, Thalia, and Nico had to be the ones on the quest. I checked on Percy who was expected to wake up within the next few hours. I told the kid to let me know when he woke up so I could talk to him about the quest. I then left to find Thalia and Nico to talk to them about the quest. As soon as I found Nico I found Thalia. They were already talking about it and what they were going to pack and stuff like that. I decided not to bug them and went to my cave where I laid down and drifted into a deep sleep.
