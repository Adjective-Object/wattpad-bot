"We've got it! I can even see outside!! We can finally get out!" England exclaimed in relief.
Japan gave a small smile and took a deep breath. "Thank God...Let's call the others here, quickly!"
England nodded and grabbed my arm. "Yeah! C'mon, _____."
"Okay!" I replied.
England and I ran back together, leaving Japan and America behind.

Before I could even tell the two to be careful, they were already out of our sight. I turned to America and motioned him to follow them and go back.
"Well, let's go." I told him.
I was about to start walking, when America placed a hand on my shoulder and spoke, "Hold on, Japan."
I was silent. I waited for him to continue speaking.
"I haven't asked why you brought me along yet." He said in a serious tone.
I couldn't help but smirk at his words. "Well, you've grown sharper."
America crossed his arms, closed his eyes and spoke, "Mhmm.. I've been 'reading the atmosphere' a lot today. Thanks to that, I got what you were saying earlier at once."
I gave out a small chuckle before replying,
"Right. Then it looks like we're going to have a nice chat together."
