My name is April, but everyone call me Pooda.
I'm 18, in my last year of High School. Yea Booa i'm that Senior lol.
But just like any other teen you get love struck. Just so happens its my best friend Jazmine. But being this far down in the friend zone it's kind of hard making a move.
Plus, she has a girlfriend but she aint no good, but can't tell my best friend she might think i'm lying cause she know i don't like her. I've known Jazmine for pretty much my whole life. But, I love her as a friend and as. my lover. I want her to be mines.

Hey y'all my name is Jazmine A.K.A Jaz.
Im 17, also a senior soon to be turning 18 in a few weeks.
I'm taken by the fine ass girl named Clarissa but like to be called Chuchu. I also have the worlds best friend I call her Pooda.
Speaking of her now she is a fine ass female, but she got hoes lol.
She goofy, sexy, athletic, and just over all mmm. Buuut, then again she my best friend i can't think of her that way.

My name Clarissa better known as ChuChu.
Im 17 in my last year of school.
I date this fine ass girl named Jaz. Man I love her but i'm kinda of a player and i think her best friend know.
Her best friend Pooda she knew me for a min when i was with my last girl and seen how I act. I am scared of losing Jaz, but it's hard to stop my ways. I'm just stuck on what to do.
