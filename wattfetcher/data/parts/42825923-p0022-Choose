"What?"
"How are you and Chris?I didn't know he slept over." he said.
When I heard him say 'how are Chris and I' I had a flash back of two days ago when Mayra and I snuck out of the window with Chris and Brent and we all went to the movies and after,Chris and I kissed but he made a promise to never talk about it because we didn't really know each other well.
"Alex?" My dad eyes widened.
"Um yeah he slept over." I said,snapping away from my thought.
"Anything else happend?Like,i don't know,two days ago with you and Chris?" He asked,raising an eyebrow.
"No nothing happened." I lied "I got to go." I said,walking away to my room.
