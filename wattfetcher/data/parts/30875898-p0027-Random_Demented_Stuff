True love isn't two doves intertwined together
True love isn't something that will last forever
I wish I knew weekday true love was
But the question is, who really does?
I think I have an idea, so let's see
This is what true love is to me
You might not be perfect, but that's okay
You're the one I think every day
When you are troubled, or feeling down
I won't give you words of wisdom
I won't make a sound
A noiseless hug is all you need
As motionless tears escape from me
But don't cry for me, I'm not worth your tears
I won't be leaving for a while, so just text your fears
I'd rather wait and watch where my heart leafs me from here
As true love leads me back to you, my dear
