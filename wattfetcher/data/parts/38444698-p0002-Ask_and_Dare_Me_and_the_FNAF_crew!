Here's the first question from @SnowSparktheKat "Do you actually eat pizza all the time, CAN you actually eat pizza?"
Me: "Good first question, Spark, but let's test that. CHICA, GET IN HERE!"
Chica: "I'M BUSY MAKING PIZZA!"
Me: "I have pizza in here!"*winks*
Chica: "OKAY!!"
*Chica dashes through the door with ravenous eyes*
Chica: "PIZZA?!"
*Runs to lock the door*
Me: "Chica, Spark, from Wattpad wanted to know if you actually eat pizza, and if you actually can eat pizza."
Chica: "Umm, if you promise not to tell the others."
Me:"Okay. I promise."
Chica: "Wait, what's a Wattpad?"
Me: "I'll show you later."
Chica: "Okay, I LOVE PIZZA, and always will. But, since I was forcefully stuffed into this suit as a tiny child, I can't ACTUALLY eat pizza, I just cram it into my animatronic beak-thing. I don't know what happens to the pizza afterwards, but I think that's why there's a horrible smell."
Me: "Eww...I apologize for anyone that is disturbed by Chica."
Chica: "Yeah, I have a weird backstory, but...PIIIIIIIZZZZZAAAAA!!!!!!"
*pushes Chica out the door as she glares creepily through the office window*
Me: Chica, can you please leave? -_-
Chica: "Not 'til you look at the tablet, Mr. Schmidt."
Me: "Wha- I'm not Mike Schmidt, wait I know what you're doing."
