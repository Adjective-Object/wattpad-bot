Me: "I thought that was pretty good! But, we have to see how well Toy Bonnie does to determine who's better."

Toy Bonnie: "It was..okaaayy.. but I would do WAY better! ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!"

*Guitar intro*
There was a full moon in the sky
We met a brand new robot friend
At first he was a little shy
He would not play pretend
He sang just fine and played in time, but did not look the part
So we lovingly decided to give him a brand new start

NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY OR DO
IT'S NEVER UP TO ME OR YOU
WE SMILE NOW AND SING A CHEER
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
NEVER FEAR, THE SHOW WILL GO ON

We removed his squishy casing
To keep his circuits save and sound
And ended up replacing it
With scraps that we had found
But what a shame (A crying shame)
Our friend was in a world of pain
Oh, we tried to fix him up
But it was all in vain

NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY OR DO
IT'S NEVER UP TO ME OR YOU
WE SMILE NOW AND SING A CHEER
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
NEVER FEAR, THE SHOW WILL GO ON

We just don't know what went wrong
We tried to get along
But our new robot friend's power faded
We did our best to fix our guest
We hated to see him so distrest
We said farewell and had him terminated

Every toy eventually breaks
Every battery fades and drains
Even the tiniest little mistakes
Can leave behind the messiest stains
We know that we'll be alright
Though he didn't Survive The Night
Through the pain and through the tears
