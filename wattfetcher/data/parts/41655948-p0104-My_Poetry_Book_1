My eyes feel heavy Like the clouds in my mind. I could spend my forever Swimming in the stars of your eyes. We are just kids, Reciting poetry all night. I'd never go back To when words were just words, And I thought I liked guys Not girls. I need to find the words to fill The great spaces between these letters. You make every song seem a little easier To handle. The only time I love my name Is when you say it. - (m.m)  shitty poetry when you've had 3 hours of sleep oops
