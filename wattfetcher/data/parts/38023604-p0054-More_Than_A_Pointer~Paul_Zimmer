I started to say something but he cut me off.
"i also know that you are in way to good of a mood to be on your period. When you are, you usually get quite upset at lots of things, like spilling milk or just anything. You usually want me to give you a back massage because that sometimes helps get rid of the pain that cramps cause.
"And of course, if you were on your period, i would be able to hear you opening your lady products from the bathroom."
My face turned beet red at the last part.
"You can hear that?" i whispered.
He rubbed his thumb over my cheek. "Yup. They don't exactly make the packaging quiet, you know."
"God this is so embarrassing." I mumbled.
"Good. This is my revenge for you sending me on errands all the time."
I grabbed a pillow and covered  my face with it.
He pulled it away from me and smiled slightly.
"Don't hide your face from me. You're a girl. It's not like you have the power to choose to get periods or not."
"I actually do. If i get birth control it will stop my period."
"Well... do you want to get birth control?"
"Nah. I can deal with a period... i think... Eh, i don't really care."
Paul laughed and pressed his lips against mine, before pulling away and smiling at me.
"I love you so much, you dork."
