'Jason have you finished with those crates yet?.' 'No.' Then get to work.' The crates were held tightly in the corner of the room but there was some kind of movement in them. 'Carl? The boxes are... Moving...' 'That's good!' The box split in half with a sharp crash. 'The heck?!' A gas seemed to protrude from the crate as Jason grabbed a pipe and held it steady. There was a hand that seemed to come out of the crate as it reached out to Jason, however failing. A shadowy figure clambered out from the dust and he stood there, ready to leap.
The figure ran towards Jason but the blow of the pipe onto the head caused it to topple into a pile of papers. Jason ran as fast as he could, crashing into the walls while the figure pursuited him. Jason crashed into a wall at a dead end as the figure slowly walked out of the shadows. His fingers seemed razor sharp and his arms were stretched out and flailing around. His body seemed to have been battered from the sides shown by the entrails that dangled out his side and his lips were ripped off, showing bare, mouldy gums. He walked slowly, drooling at the mouth. His fingers were put into a scissor action as he reached out. Bang! The creature toppled over Jason as a hole was visible from his forehead. It was obvious he was shot.
