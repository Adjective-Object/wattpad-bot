"Well, I guess that's not false, but it's all about preferences."
Dean listened to Cas talk about bees the entire walk.
"Why do you put up with me, huh? All I do is list bee facts," Cas asked.
"Well, personally, I think you're perfect."
Castiel felt his heart burst.
"For a best friend, you know," He added quickly, like he knew something Cas didn't.
Still, Dean thought he was perfect.
"You know, Meg was a crazy bitch for saying no to you. But I guess I can't complain too much."
"Why not?" Cas wondered aloud.
"Well, then I never would have met you."
And then something new happened.
Cas grabbed Dean by the collar of his shirt and kissed him. He kissed him so hard, one would think they broke their bones, and Cas almost ripped his shirt off him right then and there.
"Cas," Dean breathed out. "You should know... I'm really glad she said no now."
Cas and Dean laughed. They laughed and laughed until Castiel remembered.
"Lisa!" He yelled suddenly.
"What about her?" Dean asked.
"'What about her?' Dean, you're going to ask her to marry you! In, like, two days!"
"Oh... Yeah, about that..."
Then Dean got on one knee.
"Castiel James Novak." He said.
"Dean?" Cas gasped out. "W-What are you..?"
"Cas, I've known you for a while. I've known you when you're sad. And mad. And happy. By the way, you looked stunned now. I don't know what to make of it, is this good or?"
"It's good. It's really good. I love it."
"Okay, good. Uh, well, I-I always have gotten lost in your eyes. Like right now. Where was I going with this?"
"Uh, a great place. But first, Dean, this doesn't make any sense."
"It doesn't?"
"Lisa, Dean. I thought you loved her."
"Uh, nope. I love you."
"I love you too. So much. So damn much.
"Right, Lisa. Lisa was in on this. It was a trick from the start."
"A-A trick?"
"Yes. I've wanted to ask you to marry me for a while, but we hadn't even kissed til about five minutes ago. So I enlisted help. Sam came up with the plan. Lisa was a friend of Jess. And she was willing to help."
"Wait. So... You faked a relationship for an entire year, just to propose to me?"
"Uh... yeah. That's what I did."
"Dean, I revise what I said earlier."
"Which part? Because I recall you said 'I love you, too.'"
"The part about how I want to be proposed to. No matter what, in any life, any universe, anything, anytime, anywhere. I want to be proposed to by you. Only you."
"Even if we were dogs?"
"Yes," Castiel laughed out. "Yes, Dean, even I'd we were dogs, I'd want to be yours."
