Who knew a school hallway could change your life, for better or worse...
I remember the day I saw him. Bright blonde dyed hair and blue eyes that told a thousand stories with one glimpse of the eye. He could capture any soul. He wasn't super smart nor was he stupid, but one thing he did was never give up hope without a smile. His smile shinned like the heavens shinned over earth. His smile was the light to my day, without light how can you see where you are heading? Up? Down? Wandering in the darkness is what he did to me once he left.
Senior year in high school my best friend and I were going to see if the guy she liked would give her his number. That was the day I met him. Strumming his guitar in the far corner of the classroom, acting as if he could care less about the girls screaming for his music. Looking back all I can do is laugh, laugh with tears of sorrow and joy. He promptly stopped playing his music as my friend started to ask for his friend's number. His friend was acting like a player and gave his number to me not her. Thus, she cried so I told him off, that was when it caught HIS attention. He walked up so close to me that I could feel his warm breath dancing my lips (This was the first time I saw him up close.) with a soft voice he said, "I like your attitude." That sent shivers down my spine. I ran out of the classroom with my crying friend feeling almost embarrassed for a reason I still don?t understand fully to this day.
On my way home I realized that I left my phone at school. So, I called my phone on the nearest pay-phone. To my surprise a boy answered my phone. He told me I could get my phone at school in classroom B-10. Happily I agreed and ran there as fast as I could.
I got to the classroom only to see that boy with blonde hair and warm breath sitting there in the empty classroom. He stood up and pulled out my phone. I walked into the classroom and tried to grave it only for him to push me against the chalkboard and kiss me. It was my first kiss. I pushed him away and ran home crying. But, not a sad cry more of a happy- perhaps- cry. On my phone contact I had a new speed- dial 1 contact, "Niall" and a picture of the blonde haired boy . After a few months I realized that Niall hadn't been attending school.
I asked around where I could find him, he was at home. When I knocked on the door a lady answered saying she was Niall's older sister. She took me to see him. He was asleep and looked weak. But, once I walked in he opened his eyes and smiled. Suddenly, I was over stuck with his beauty. All I could say was, "where have you been?" he didn't say a word.
He stood up grabed my hand and took me to a river and said, "This is where heaven and Earth meet. come here when you miss me." I smiled and he kissed me as the sun set. We began to date after that.
Four months later Niall dropped out of school. He told me to stop calling him. We were over. A week later he called me from the hospital asking just about life. I told him he sounded weird. That's when my world came crashing down, like a vase full of water crashing on to a hard, cold wood floor. He said he had a rare type of lung cancer that cannot be cured. While he was on the phone his voice became weak. He said it was getting hard for him to breath. I started to run in the rain to the hospital at night. I got a text but ignored it till I got to the hospital. When I found his room the nurse said he had just passed away. I cried and cried. I wanted to call him to say that this was a mean joke. When I opened my phone I had a text, it was from Niall. It was a picture of him smiling with the caption that said, "when you miss me go to the river where heaven touches the Earth, I'll be there smiling down at you :)"
And since then that place became my home.
