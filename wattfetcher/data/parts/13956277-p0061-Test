"It even makes it worse, can we get to the point please?" The principle got confused.
"Okay Mr.Sean, just be patient. Is bullying allowed here ?" I asked again.
"No, GET TO THE POINT" Mr.Sean answered angrily.
"Keep calm Mr.Sean. Okay, now, Conor was pinning a boy to the wall and was about to punch him while who I assume to be his girlfriend was telling the boy some horrible things, so I stopped them and then you came. May I go to my class now ? Chemistry, you know ...." I smiled.
"Yes you can go. Me and Conor will have some talk" Conor was playing with his fingers nervously.
Now, to Mrs.Peterson : the one with no mercy.

Lunch time.
"LET ME GO I WANNA KICK HER BUTT" I looked around and saw Miley fighting to escape from the girls who were trying to calm her down.
"LET ME GO I WANNA PUNCH THAT MUSLIMA'S FACE" It just took me half a second to know that she was referring to me.
"What's wrong ?" I asked
"DON'T ACT LIKE AN INNOCENT BABY YOU B****" Everybody beside me gasped at her words, I wasn't surprised at her attitude.
"Let her go" I told the girls who were holding her from attacking me with her clenched fists and sharp nails/teeth.
She came running to my direction and pushed me to a table.
Here comes the whole school to watch.
"I bet with 50 dollars that Miley will rip Leena apart" Someone said.
"I bet with 100 that Leena won't let her. Man, did you see how she slapped Jake the other day ?" His friend said. Now back to the fight ...
"What ?" I said coldly while her sharp nails were poking my shoulders.
"YOU DON'T KNOW HA ?" She spat.
"No, I honestly don't " I smiled coldly.
"Just let her go Miley" Here comes ..............Â  ELINAAA.
"Go away Elina it's none of your business" Miley said while her eyes were still glaring at mine giving me a deadly look.
"Just tell me what do you want, I'm hungry and willing to eat my lunch, so quick" I raised my eyebrow.
"Here comes the eyebrow move for the 1749th time" Damon stepped in.
"CONNOR GOT EXPELLED BECAUSE OF YOU" Miley shouted angrily.
"Oh really ? what a surprise *fake smile* I didn't expect that, I'm even surprised more because you didn't go with him"
"You ***** I'm gonna-
"I really don't think that it's a great idea to attack me *Whispers* since I got a black belt in karate and you saw how I was about to twist Connor's fist" I winked.
"Time to go to class, come on Miley" Damon came and threw Miley over his shoulder and lifted her out.
"YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT, LET ME GO YOU STUPID MEMBER OF THE CARTERS" Miley pinched and punched Damon's back but he laughed and kept walking.
"I WON THE BET MMWAAHAHHAHAA" Someone said.
"Its nor fair man, Damon got in" The other boy whimpered.
