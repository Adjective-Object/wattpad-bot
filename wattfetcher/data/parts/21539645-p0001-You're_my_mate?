Shadow's POV
I haven't done this much running since the last time I almost got caught, and even then I had lost them rather quickly. But by the different smells this time, so I'm guessing father and uncle got better personal to come get me. My dad is the alpha of the Frostbite Pack; the strongest pack in North America. He wants to send me to my uncle's academy; he the second strongest. He uses the students and faculty as his pack.
I wouldn't be as worried right now if it was just me, but I won't be the reason someone else gets hurt. I have to worry about Alex. For the past year and a half I've made my way from California to Canada. I've tried getting them off my scent by going just about everywhere. When I went straight north it was to obvious so I went almost all the way east. So when I passed somewhere in northern Kentucky I found Alex. He was in the woods running from his pack, he was 15 and didn't want to be alpha; he will be 16 in a few weeks.
I mind link him since we are in wolf form, 'Alex, go into town and hide in some store that's to the left of when we go in. They want me so they won't worry about you.'
'What!? No!'
'Do as I say now!'
'Fine! See ya later Shadow.'
Once we get there he turns left heading for some boutique shop since its the closest, and I go right. The men and wolves followed me like I knew they would. I push myself to go faster and faster, but we've been at this for at least half an hour and they had caught us right after we did a run. I'm getting really tired, after ten more minutes I feel myself starting to slow down.
'Shadow, I back tracked and they are closing in on all sides of you. If you don't surrender they will catch you anyway and hurt you.'
'Uhg! We made it to South Dakota. We were so close!' I growled.
I stop running and shift out of my black wolf once they get closer. They hand me a blanket to cover myself and said they will bring some clothes to me. The only girl held the blanket while I changed into a pair of black skinny jeans and a black fitted tee and hoodie. So he still remembers my taste in clothing, that @$hole. Once I was done Alex dropped down next to me and shifted out of his wolf; which was a mix of browns, blondes, and golds. He was handed some basketball shorts and a hoodie; so they did know about him.
"So the runaway wolf, or should I say science experiment, is finally giving up? After being so close. You're pitiful." Josh laughed. I growled back at him, "Shut up cousin! At least I didn't kill my wolf cause I was so scared and to weak to handle my first shift! Don't forget I can rip you to shreds!"
One of the men stepped up, "Joshua, Shut up!" He looked like he should be in the army or something. "And all of y'all still in wolf form go to the back and change." All of the wolves went back except one, but I could barely notice. Being around all these people piss me off, and what makes it even worse is that I drug Alex into this. I'm so stupid!
The man who I guessed was in charge brought me out of my thoughts, "Aiden, that means you too. Go shift back now!" The white wolf just turned around and growled at him. It even scared me a little and I'm a complete bad@$. Next thing I know I hear bones cracking and he's standing there looking at me, and he's naked which is gross. He starts coming toward me. Oh no.
*******************************************************************So... What'd y'all think? Cause I don't know. But let me know. If y'all want I can at least try to update once every week or every two weeks cause I have a very busy schedule.
