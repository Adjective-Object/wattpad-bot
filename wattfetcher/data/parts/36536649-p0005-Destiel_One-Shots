They heard the door open but it didn't register until they heard Mr. Singer's voice.

They instantly pulled apart. Castiel turned as red as their friend Charlie's hair.

"Boys, I don't care what your love life entails," Mr. Singer said, giving Castiel and Dean a breath of relief. "What I do care about, however, is that you're sitting on my tables!"
And with that, they scrambled off the tables.
Dean Winchester never needed another tutoring session, and Cas never got another B.
They both had exactly what they needed in a boyfriend(eventually husband), best friend, and Potterheads.
