"Quintin! Kyle! There's some girls here for you!" I yell. Two seconds later they're bounding down the stairs.
"Who? Where?" Kyle ask, out of breath.
"Oh, I don't know their names, but their really pretty. They're outside."
"Sweet!" Quintin yells as they push eachother and sprint out the front door.
A few silent seconds go by until "There's nobody here."
"Oh boys, I'm here." Payton says dramatically until high pitch screams fill the air.
I stuff a house key in my pocket before going outside and locking the door behind me.
Payton is squirting the boys with freezing cold water from a nerf water gun while I fill my hands with paint and attack. Kyle runs for the door.
"It's locked!"
Quintin grabs a water gun we had laying in the grass and tossed a boddle of paint to his friend. They fight back.
It's a full out water gun/paint fight. So not much of revenge I guess because it's fun for everyone.
I fling a glob of paint and somehow end up hitting an old jogger.
"Hey!" The old man shouts. "Look what you did to my new shorts!"
"Sorry Mr. Longfeild. I'll mail you a check!"
"Yeah, you better! Rotten child!" he shouts before jogging back to his house.
When he's gone, we start to play a game where one person hides and everyone looks for them. Whoever chucks them with the most paint in five seconds, gets to hide. Everyone has a different color paint.
"Ready or not, here I come!" I walk slowly to where I think Kyle is hiding. I hear a voice behind me. "Hey, where do I put-" I fling a huge glop of orange paint at Kyle. Everyone else starts pelting him while counting down. "5,4,3,2,1!"
"I won!" I yell see more orange paint than anything else.
"Um, guys." I hear a voice come from around the house. Kyle walks into view. "That was Josh."
Oh Gawd. And the trouble begins.
