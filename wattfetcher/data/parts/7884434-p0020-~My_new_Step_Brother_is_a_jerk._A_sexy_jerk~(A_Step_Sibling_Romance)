His tongue swirled around my bud making my body fill with so much pleasure. "Oh god" I said running my hand through my hair. "This feels so good"
"You like that baby?" He asked in a voice that turned me on even more.
"God yes I do!" He slipped in a finger pumping it in and out of me while still eating me. I couldn't function my whole body was in a state of over boared pleasure ready to combust. "I'm gonna come!" I said moaning.
"Cum for me baby" He said quickining his pace making me empty me juices into his mouth. "You taste so good." His mouth latched back to my kitten and he began again making me squirm. It was so sensitive.
He put my legs over his shoulder and grabbed my waist holding me there. Oh god someone help me I can't handle all this pleasure he was bringing to me.
His warm tongue teased my hole making moan after moan leave my mouth. "I love your moan oh god" He said and then latching himself back.
My back arched over the bed, my head back and my mouth open no moans able to escape. I could feel it building up again and this one hit me hard! I exploded in his mouth making him make slurpy sounds as he licked up my juice. "God Shea" He got up and hovered over me and attacked my lips with his furiously. I took my hands and started unbottoning his shirt. I slipped it off of him with a little of his help and broke the kiss and looking down at his body in awe. A beautiful six pack covered ins stomach making me drool.
I heard his chuckle and looked up into his eyes. "Thats all yours baby if you want it to be. Just say the word and you can have it" I bite my lip and though for a minute. What was I doing? This is my future step brother.
I pushed Seth off of me and ran into my bathroom. I locked the door behind me and fell to the floor. What have I done?
"Shea? Whats wrong?" Seth asked through the door.
"Just please go away" I said sobbing
"Shea let me in. I won't try anything I promis just let me hold you. I can't stand the thought of you crying. Please" He said in a voice that sounded so broken.
"Seth please I need to be alone" I said rasing my voice
"FINE SHEA FUCKING FINE! I TRY SO HARD TO SHOW YOU I FUCKING CARE AND YOU DON'T GIVE ME A FUCKING CHANCE! I WILL NOT WAIT FOREVER SO MAKE YOUR FUCKING DECISION!" He yelled through the door. I stood up and unlocked the door and swinging it open.
"I DON'T WANT THIS BETWEEN US SETH! YES I DO HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU BUT IT'S WRONG! IF OUR PARENTS DON'T GET MARRIED THEN WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT! THIS IS SO WRONG SETH!"
"ITS NOT WRONG UNLESS YOU MKAE IT THAT WAY! THEY AREN'T FUCKING MARRIED YET SHEA! LET ME HAVE YOU WHILE I CAN CAUSE ONCE THEY GET MARRIED I WON'T BE ABLE TO!" He said sadness crossing over his face.
"Seth I don't know. Its like all you want is my body. Everytime we are alone thats all that happens. I don't want that. I want to go on dates. A real date and get pampered. To take a walk in the park and hold you hand joking around. Not being sexual every chance we get! I want a relationship not a fuck buddy" I slammed the door in his face and locked it. I sunk back to the floor and rested my head back on the door.
I heard Seth mumble something it sounded like a 3 word phrase. But what?
