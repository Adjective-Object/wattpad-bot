Tessa wrapped the blanket that was around her over Jaycie.  She helped Jaycie and Paul had watched clearly happy.  He had a small smile and looked down.  I patted his back then.
"She's a keeper Paul.  She will make a great mate."  I said.
"She'll make a great mother and Beta's mate as well."  He said with a grin.
I looked over at him surprised.  "What?"
"Ohh yeah, forgot to tell yah.  Greg made me his future Beta.  He was saving it for my birthday, but he needed me so I was there.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the story of how he told me tomorrow.  I'm going to sleep.  Night Alex, Night Dad."  He said and walked upstairs.
I looked to Alex and wanted to know if he knew but he just put his hands up in surrender.
"Don't look at me.  I had no idea.  You're his father, you should know this."  He said with a grin of his own.
"Your his brother, you should know it as well."  I stated.
"Hey I just met him!  You can't say that!"  He complained and he was right.
"Fine.  I'l let you off the hook.  Now go to your room.  You need sleep as well."  I said.
"You do to.  You have a job tomorrow unlike me.  Also I can sleep in if I wanted to Dad.  I'm not going anywhere tomorrow unless I want to."  He said.
"Well you're going to need to meet the pack and you are going to have to have someone with you at all times and I know just who to get to do that for me while I'm at work."  I said with a smirk as I headed upstairs.
"Who?"  He asked.
"I'm not telling you."  I said my smirk growing.
"Awe come on Dad you have to!"
"I do not!  Good night!"  I said in a childish way and shut my door rather loudly.
Oh how I love to mess with my sons and daughter.
