Adelina P.O.V.
The sight infront of me was horrifying, I stared at them laying on the ground, tied up.
Her eyes met mine, she carefully mouthed run to me, although she was careful he caught it and turned around, as soon as his eyes landed on me, his mouth turned to an evil smirk that I couldn't push away.
I looked at her again, tears streaming down her beautiful cheeks, followed by my own one, her eyes were begging me, but I couldn't do it, it was so selfish.
I turned my gaze to him, his smirk widened at the sight of my tears, knowing that he reached what he wanted, he looked like the devil himself.
He took a step towards me, and it was the moment that I made my decision, giving her a last glance before I started running away, leaving everything behind me, I hold to the bags on my shoulders as I got out and away quickly.
I didn't look behind me knowing that it will only cause me to fall down, I kept running, fighting my own tears, because it will blur my vision, and I didn't want such a thing right now.
I was focusing on my steps and every move I take, telling myself to never stop, but I couldn't help when I heard a gunshot, followed by another one.
I stopped dead In my track, looking at the place that I just ran from, which was a very far spot now.
I started running again, but this time I didn't fight it, I let the tears race down my face as the wind pushed them behind.
I ran very fast that my lung hurt, followed by my legs, but the unbearable pain was the one in my heart as I tried to push away the thought that kept hunting me.
It finally broke free, filling my mind with horrible thoughts, and my heart with killing pain....I am orphan.
