"Thanks, you do too." I say quietly.
"Oh you two just hug and make up I am out of here." I hear Grandma speak up as she reaches down to her wheelchair wheels to propel her forward. I look after her as she makes her way to the back yard. "I will yell if I fall, otherwise you two are free to rip each others clothes off!"
"Grandma!" I yell after her glaring at the back of her head. Yeah, you better run away old lady! I say in my head at the same time I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up red faced to turn my glare on the man infront of me.
"Oh, you know you dont scare me with that look Allycat." I glare even harder at the sound of his old nickname for me. I shove his hand off my shoulder and turn to go inside the house. I slam the front door closed only to hear it being opened up once again as I walk into the kitchen. I yank open cupboard doors just to slam them shut again at not seeing what I want to see. That would be really hard to do because what I want to see isn't in the cupboards he is staring at me. Resigned I slam the last door closed as I sink to the floor putting my head in my hands.
"Why?" I ask defeated. "Why now? Why come back now?" I ask more to myself than anyone.
