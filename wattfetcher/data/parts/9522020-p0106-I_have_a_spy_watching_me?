Chapter 20
*Jaycie's POV*
I had woken up in the hospital room. I looked around hoping it was just a nightmare, but it isn't. This is a real life situation in a place that I think is a nightmare. I really don't want to be here. Looking at the people in the seats I see Dad, Paul, Chase, Xander, Tania, Thalia, Morse, and Justin. I started to panic though. I don't want to be here.
"Dad, Dad. Wake-up, please." I said as I was breathing hard.
I was highly afraid of hospitals. Justin and Chase automatically woke-up. Justin stood up quickly and Chase as well. They both came over.
"Hey, hey, hey Jaycie, it's alright." Chase said.
I shook my head no.
"No, it's not. Dad wake up." I cried.
"Jaycie, we tried to get you to be nursed at home, but they won't let us let you. Right now I need you to breath slowly. You can do it. Just breath in and out."
I tried to breath. I tried slowly breathing.
"That's it sis. There you go." Justin said as he gave my hand a reassuring squeeze.
"You'll be out of here, I'll get you out of here. I promise, I'll do it right now." He said and kissed me on my temple.
"What is he doing?" Paul asked.
Then he saw that I was awake. He started to wake Dad.
"Dad, Jay's awake. Wake-up you old lug. She's panicking."
Dad woke up automatically.
"I tried Jaycie, I really tried Jaycie. They wouldn't let me. They said that you can't be moved from here to the house."
I just nodded as I hugged Justin as he was the closest one to me. He hugged me and tried to make me feel better.

*Chase's POV*
I walked out of the room as soon as I kissed Jaycie on her forehead. I brought my phone out immediately after. I opened my phone starting to call my mom. After the second ring she answered me. I didn't let her have time to answer her phone as I hurriedly asked her my question.
"Mom, please get me permission for Jaycie to be nursed at home." Maybe that was a bit more of a statement.
"Why, what's going on?" Mom asked me.
"Jaycie just had a panic attack and it isn't helping that doctors are trying to calm her down. It's just making it worst for her. Her dad is trying to get rid of them with her friends. I need that permission ASAP, Mom."
"Alright, I'll talk to you soon. It will only take five minutes." Mom says.
I say an okay and hang up. I go back to the room and yell out for everyone to shut up. They all look at me. I glare at all the doctors.
"You who are not family or friends get out now." I start to only be interrupted.
"Who the heck do you think you are?" The female doctor asked.
"Why don't we get outside and discuss that? I bet you 20 bucks that I can get you to stay out of this room." I say.
"Lets see if you can kid." She said again.
"Alright all nurses and doctors or anyone that has a job at this hospital get out and I can tell you how I'll be going home with 20 bucks from each and every single one of you." I said smugly.
