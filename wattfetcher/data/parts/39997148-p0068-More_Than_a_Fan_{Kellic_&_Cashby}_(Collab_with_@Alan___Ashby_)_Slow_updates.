"You're an ass and you're not getting your bunk back." He said covering his eyes.
"Yes I am." I said putting my clothes on and pushing him over so I could get in. "See I'm in here."
"Yeah well get off." He said pushing me.
"No." I said wrapping my arm around him, "I'm staying right here in my bunk."
"No get out." He said struggling to get away from me, "Your bunk is the one down there."
"Uh, no you're stuck with me unless you leave."
"Why?" He whined pushing at my chest.
"Because this is my bunk."
"No your bunk is the smelly one down there."
I shook my head and pulled my blankets up over myself and him, "Night."
"Austin go away!"
I shook my head again and pulled him closer burying my face in his neck. "Night Ashby."
"You suck."
"And swallow."
"Oh my god you're a twelve year old boy." He grumbled.
"I'm not twelve, I'm twenty-two."
"Well you act like you're twelve."
"Well you like me."
"I don't know why."
"I think it's my hotness and charm."
"No, that went down the drain the second you laid on my bed all sweaty and gross."
"Well then it's got to be to be my, 'big deal' then, right?"
"Go to sleep."
"It is then." I said looking at him.
"Austin it's late and I'm tired. Go to sleep." He said blushing.
"Answer my question then."
"No it's not because of your big deal now sleep."
"Well you get to sleep I'm gonna go hang out with the guys unless you want me to stay."
"Go Austin. I'm sleeping."
"Okay goodnight." I told him and kissed his forehead softly.
"Night."
I left my bunk smiling before going to the lounge and hanging out with the guys.
