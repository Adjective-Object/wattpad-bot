I'd be lying, If I said I was just fine, I'm drowning in the waters, And you're next in line. I am self destructive, And it is going to bring you down, I write poetry, But these words don't seem to speak very loud. You're the sunshine in me, But I'm six feet underground. And just when I think You've erased all my doubt, The demons inside Start crashing around. - (m.m)
