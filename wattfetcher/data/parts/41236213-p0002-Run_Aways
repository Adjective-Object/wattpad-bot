Dris POV
I put in my headphones and "Castle of glass" by Lincoln Park starts playing. I grab my sketch pad an start on a drawing. It started out as scribbles, but somehow ended out as angel wings. I looked over at Max and saw her drawing a purple TARDIS.
Max POV
My TARDIS was turning out lovely and it was probably one of the best drawings I had ever done. "Where's the Doctor?" Dris asked me, looking up from her notebook. "In the TARDIS." I. Said as I started writing POLICE on he top of the box.
Dris POV
"And which companion is he with?" I asked curiously Max raised an eyebrow and said "Amy and Rory, obviously!" I smiled slightly, then snuggled further into my blanket. "All passengers please remain seated as we descend." a voice said over the speakers. "That's right Max, don't jump up and down." I teased her. She rolled her eyes and I smiled.
Max POV
"Knock, knock." I said to Dris. She sighed. "Who's there?" She teased. "Doctor." I answered. Simply. "Doctor who?" She said sarcastically. "Donna couldn't figure that out either." I joked.
Dris POV
"Oi! How dare you?! You will pay for that!" I shouted at her and smacked her with my pillow." The stewardess looked at us and smiled slightly as she talked to the old woman next to her about how nice it was to see two sisters interacting with each other, not just on their phones.
Max POV
I admit, my joke was corny, but it was all I had at the time. "Thank you for flying with us today. We hope you enjoyed your flight!" A sweet female voice sounded over The loud speakers.Dris and I got our backpacks and exited the plane, not needing to get suitcases because we were traveling lightly.
Dris POV
"Come fly with me, lets fly lets fly away!" I sang as we went off and Max have me a look. "Wait, it should be, You've flown with me, we've flown,we've flown away!" I sang with a grin on my face as Max giggled a little. "She laughs!" I exclaimed, and Max just grinned.
Max POV
"Have you heard about that really famous detective?" I asked Dris as we walked towards our hotel.
Third POV
Somewhere far far away..."Mr. Holmes! You have got to get my daughters back! They are the only heirs to the estate! If I lose them then my whole business will pass on to someone else!" Sherlock looked at the man in disgust and then nodded. "I'll take the case."
