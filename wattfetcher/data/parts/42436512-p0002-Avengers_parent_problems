"I had an aunt who allowed me to hold my cousin."
"Well who is going to care for this... thing?"
"Us. Come on it's something new." Peter basically begs.
"I am Groot" Groot says.
"According to Groot, he's wondering what are we going to call it." Rocket translates.
"(Name) that was my mom's name" Peter says firmly. His tone told the others that the name he picked was final.

Pietro Maximoff:
Pietro was having a hard day at work; Fury was having him do stupid ass errands. On one of these errands Pietro happened to be at the wrong place at the right time... you basically got pushed out of a window and landed right in his arms.
"Okay I didn't see that one coming." Pietro says. Pietro's silver-blue eyes are met with (eye color) orbs. He chuckles and carefully holds you as he races back to SHIELD HQ. Surprisingly Fury allowed Pietro to keep you, Fury even gave Pietro the rest of the day off.
A little confused Pietro zooms off to Stark Tower.
"You're back early Pietro." Wanda says with an amused smirk.
"Uh Fury allowed me to have the rest of the day off... I think mainly because I found this little one." Pietro replies carefully handing you over to his sister.
"What are you going to call her?" Wanda asks in Russian.  ((Что вы собираетесь назвать ее?))
"I was thinking of (Name)." Pietro replies in Russian. ((Я думал о имени.))
