Hunter grins as the bed dipped down, proving he was laying on the bed next to me. He played with my hair and ran his hand through it. I moan and turn, facing him "You, Hunter, are very very annoying" He smiles and rips the covers off my body. I moan, covering my eyes. Hunter kisses my cheek and says "Dont be jealous" He smiles "Oh rub off on me Hunter!" I laugh and he pulls me closer, tickling me. I twist and turn. He's laughing and My lungs start to hurt. Hunter nudges my collar bone with his nose. I pull away and smile at him "What time is it?" I ask. He shrugs "It is...10:36" Crap. I have a date with Jason Duate. I sit up and throw my legs over the bed "Are you okay?" I nod "Im fine" I didnt tell Hunter about Jason "You know Jason Duate right?" Hunter nods and rubs my back "Ya. I already know. You have a date with him, tonight" I nod "Im sorry I know we were supposed to go to the movies" Hunter frowns and starts to get up "Are you leaving?" I ask, pulling my jeans on. Hunter reaches for the doorknob "No. But im hungry" he leaves the room. He comes back and slams the door behind him. I burst out laughing. Hunter went out with only his underwear on. He glares at me "Now that was stupid Hun"
