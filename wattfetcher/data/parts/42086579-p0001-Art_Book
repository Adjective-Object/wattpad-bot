First artwork posted and it's my take on the purple guy from the FNaF series! This is actually a HEAVILY cropped version of a reference sheet that's on my deviantart (under the same username if you may or may not already know). If you'd like to see the full version, feel free to check it out there! Plus, you can read about his character biography there too.
And yes, Vincent Mathias Aldrich is his full name. At least in the FNaF AU I created with EncodedWarrior .
Enjoy!
