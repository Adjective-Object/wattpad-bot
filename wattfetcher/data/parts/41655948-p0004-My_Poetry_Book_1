I do see where you are now and I'd do anything to get it back. It's too crazy to miss something you never had but you seemed mine- as much as my name is mine although it doesn't leave a sour taste in my mouth to say my name the way it does when I say yours. You followed me like a shadow and I didn't mind. You saved me and I got my hopes up. Then you left- as simple as that, and even though you had faded away, I still felt traces of you everywhere. All the scents that remind me of you- all the things you said, I can't forget. I can't imagine anyone loving you the way I did. And only if you knew that if you came back, I wouldn't let you in, it would be fatal. I have been spending months learning to live without you and I cannot say that it's necessarily been successful but I have programmed my broken soul to let you go.
And let you go, I did.
