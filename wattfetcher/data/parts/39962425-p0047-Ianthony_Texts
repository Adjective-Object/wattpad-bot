A: I almost went to Casey's room to wake her up for school today again. :(
I: I know what you mean, Ant. It's been about three months since she died. Nothing is the same anymore.
A: It feels lonely in this house without her and Luna.
I: Yeah. It really is.
A: I miss her, Ian. I miss them both so much.
I: I miss her too. I miss them both too.
A: If we adopted again.... Got a little boy this time.... Would it help fill the little missing places in our hearts from Casey and Luna?
I: I-I don't know. Are we ready to adopt again?
A: We have Â a room ready for having a tween.
I: Yeah, but Casey picked out all that stuff just for her.
A: I know. We'll have to put her stuff up in the attic.
I: Should we leave the bed?
A: Yeah. It'd be so much easier to leave it.
I: So.... We are going to do this?
A: Yeah. We need to try to move on. Casey would want us to move on.
I: Okay <3
A: I love you <3
I: I love you too <3
