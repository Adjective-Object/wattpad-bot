CHAPTER IX: Phone Calls (Part 3)---
-*-*-*-Iron Cell Room-*-*-*-
//Third Person PoV//
Japan tries to cut the bars using his sword, sound of the clashes filled the room.
"It's no use!! My sword can't cut the bars." the slim, Japanese man sighed.
Russia lowered his head, "We can't just use brute strength... Too bad. I don't know what he was going to do, but we have to go after him quickly."
"But then we can't get out unless someone opens it for us from the outside." Canada told them softly.
" 'Someone'...that would be _____... Where did she disappear to?!" England asked.
Prussia looked around. "...She was with us on the way here..."
"Aiyah! We have to look for the girl, too!" China exclaimed.
"It seems that Italy has overlooked ______. What if....what if the girl gets chased by the monster?! Mon dieu!..." France said in a worried tone.
"No... I trust that she knows when and where the monster would show up at a time like this..." Japan told them.
Germany raised an eyebrow. "Huh? How are you able to say that, Japan?"
Prussia crossed his arms and nodded. "Hnn... The frau knows how this...'game' plays out..."
They all looked at Japan and Prussia with confusion written all over their faces.
"What?! What are you guys talking about?" England demanded to know.
Japan looked away. "I'm sorry...but we wanted _____-chan to tell you this herself... "
"Ha~ I knew it... The little sunflower does know something." Russia said cheerfully.
"Ja...it was a bit difficult to believe at first...but she's...not from...'this world'..." Prussia told them.
America went up to them excitedly, "OOH! She's an alien??!"
England rolled his eyes and hit America on the head.
"Oww..." America let out, clutching the area England hit.
"No, you git! I don't think they mean it like that! I think they're referring to the girl...not being from--this dimension?" England concluded.
Japan nodded, "Hai. She comes from a place where this situation we're in is not real...but only fiction."
"I'm sorry, but I'm really getting lost here, aru." China told him.
"The frau hasn't told us the full story yet... she was supposed to do that today... She was supposed to explain to us everything she knew..." Prussia said, looking across the bars.
"Hmm? Could it be that she knew that we'd be locked in here? How come she's not showing up to get us out of here?" Russia inquired.
America sighed. "...What are we going to do? If no one shows up--"
Suddenly, they hear the door open.
"_____! _____! Oh thank god! Let the hero out of this cage now please!! HAHAHA!"  the loud American exclaimed. Though, the person who entered was not the girl they expected, but a man with dark brown hair and green eyes.
"Whoa!! Wh-what is this?!What are you all doing?!" Spain asked, confused as to why the countries were locked up in a cell.
