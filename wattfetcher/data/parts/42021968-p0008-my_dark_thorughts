It's  my fight my life and my head there is a battle  in side my head my scars that I make while fighting it my heart that might not survive it my words that keep it alive I say things that make it worse and I can't make it better mood matter what I do I have a fight in my head and the people who fight it they all wants  me dead even if it's just in my head I fight every day just to fight again the next day now I realize this fight in my head will never  end just like the bullies at school you win
