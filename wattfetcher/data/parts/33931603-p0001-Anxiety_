I have an anxiety disorder.
It's not a normal one.
It makes me sick when I'm in huge crowds,like really sick.
It's worse when I eat,but I'm not anorexic or bulimic,it's just my disorder.
My mom thinks it's all in my head, so she takes me to huge partys and everything.
She watches me freak out, and gets mad when we have to leave early.
