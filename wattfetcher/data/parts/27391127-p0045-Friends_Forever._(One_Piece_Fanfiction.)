With Doflamingo was trapped in a rapidly spinning tornado and it is Natural's wonder how Doflamingo ecaped without a single scratch.

It must be noted that both Haruka and Aya used Haki whereas Sakura didn't because she didn't know how to.

Doflamingo got up and started laughing. "I see that the school taught you well."

"Sakura," Haruka called. She turned her head in response as Haruka laid out his plan.

Aya on the other hand, stood close to Millie, who for some reason hasn't left yet.

"Don't worry Millie. I will protect you."

All too suddenly, Aya and Twilight felt themselves being lifted onto a scaly surface. By the time they knew it, they were on a white Chinese dragon flying away from Doflamingo.

"Sakura?"
"Yep!"

Sakura's dragon form was a white Chinese dragon. It was two dark blue horns and four limbs. Her wings were somehow feathery which is abnormal for a dragon.

"Where are you taking us?"

Sakura didn't answer.

"Sakura, answer me!"

"Far away. Anywhere, far away from Doflamingo." Sakura answered softly. But in her Dragon's voice it was pretty loud.

"Good. Then take Millie-chan, I'm going to help Haruka." Aya said. At that particula moment, it seemed that Sakura went faster.

"Sakura' slow down! I wanna help Haruka!"

"Haruka specifically told me to get you and Millie-chan away from Doflamingo."

Aya's eyes widen before they went back to normal. How long can you stationary in the air?"

"As long as I want, why?"

"I'm gonna help him."
"Aya!"
"From here."

"Can you see that far."
"Yep, its very hard not to notice the Pink Fluff."

Sakura stopped and Aya stood up watching Doflmaingo's tiny feature.

Aya: Kira Kira no Arrow.

Aya called as a pink glittery bow  appeared in her hands and she fired a single glitter arrow.
