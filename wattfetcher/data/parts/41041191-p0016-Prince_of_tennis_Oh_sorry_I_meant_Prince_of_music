Hi ppl
I am sorry to say but
I got sick:(
that is the reason why I havent updated because I am sick and is never in a mood to update because I have a huge headache, throat feel dry and I have a stuffy nose.
But not only is it that it is just that school is almost over for us(June 25th) I am busy with finishing stuff Like I got a project due on this up-coming Monday and all so yeah.
I am only on the computer today because U have yo write the stuff down on the computer.
And why am I going to school?1 Because I am awesome and don't want extra homework not only that its just because I took half day came in the after noon and then yeah I felt OK. But also it just that Not matter how sick I am I contain to be able to go to school because my classroom is like a home to me(hey it is a portable).And yep tho I still Am. But I am improving (kinda)
So yes I would probably update the next chapter on the upcoming Monday AFTER school when I handed in my project and have that out of my hands, and probably be in amuch better state then I am right now
After that I am free!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So thats al and well BUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
