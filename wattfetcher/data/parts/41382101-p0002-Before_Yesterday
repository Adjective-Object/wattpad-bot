"Well now that, thats over let's go eat I'm hungry". I tried to say calmly it didn't come out that way but oh well. Just as I turned around I seen her. The most beautiful, scary, smartest girl her name was Chyna Jade Riley. I've like her since sixth grade and I'm still afraid to talk to her she's so likeable. She is so confident. I never asked her out because I'm scared of her though once  in seventh grade she beat up this guy it was funny and the kid deserved it though but ever since I've been scared to ask her out but I'm going to get her this year. She looked at me with her dimples, curly hair, freckles, and rocking body. During school she's this popular girly girl. But afterwards she a basketball player and a wrestler on the boys A team and so am I. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see the girl you like everyday and sometimes that includes parties on the weekends. This girl was my dream girl if I could have her I'd be the happiest boy on the planet and you know why, because I would be with an angel that fell straight from heaven. Everytime I think about her I turn into a girl. I think about her at night, during practice, during the day, always.
As I walked into the cafeteria with the gourmet lunch and chefs with actual degrees this girl stopped me. She said if I wanted to have a "good time" to call her and she wrote down her number. I'm a big flirt so i flirted with the girl for a while and told her I'd call her tonight but we all knew that wasn't going to happen.

After lunch I went to my next class and she was in this class also which was awesome. Mrs. Malo said we had a project and she was assigning partners Ty and Malory, Ki and Jenny, Jack and Miyca,......, and then she said it Zeke and Chyna.
