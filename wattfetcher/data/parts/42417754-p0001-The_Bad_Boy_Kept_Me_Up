Imagine this scenario. You're home alone in your very peaceful home. You decide to study in case your mean teacher decides to surprise you with a pop quiz. You pull out your books and start to study.

You're soon interrupted as you hear music and loud chatter. You look out and find many cars parked out in your neighbor's house.
What do you do?
Well, you accidentally look out the other window in your room and soon regret it as you find a couple making out in the room that is located right across from yours. Then, you get mad.
What else?
Oh, right. You go out and confront your neighbor.
And regret it.
And soon, he won't ever let you have peace.
Ever.
