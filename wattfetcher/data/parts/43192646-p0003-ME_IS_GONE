"Babe, yes or no. Do you vwamt to marry me?" He gets a thinking look on his face.
"Why yes cr9nus I will marry y9u. 6ut now that y9u pr9p9sed. We need t9 make plans. As in wh9 is g9ing t9 sit where s9 n9 9ne is triggered. And.."
"Kanny, vwe vwill vworry about that later. Come on vwe havwe a big night ahead of us." I leave a tip on the check and pay for the bill itself. Lifting up kanny bridal style I walk out and put him into the car.
" S9 cr9nus, where are we g9ing next?" Im surprised he didnt say more. But the thing that got me was how he was left speechless for a second. I, cronus ampora, made kankri vantas go speechless and now hes my fiance. Could life get better. I think driving off and taking kankri out on the town in celebration of us getting married. Little did I know that things were going to take a turn in direction.
