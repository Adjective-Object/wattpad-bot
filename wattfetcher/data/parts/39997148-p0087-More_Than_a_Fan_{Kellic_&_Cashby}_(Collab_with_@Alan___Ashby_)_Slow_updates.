"Oh yeah, its two." He said trailing off, "I never liked those songs."
"Well I like starving, and when we first wrote She Makes Dirty Words I liked it too but now that we're not together that song just makes me uncomfortable."
"Yeah, that's... something."
"Hey I liked that song!" Kellin said.
"Really?" I asked him shocked.
He blushed, "Well now that I know it's about you and Jonny not so much but I used to love it. I always wondered if you really were an animal."
Before I could even say anything I heard Alan start coughing as he choked on his drink.
"Oh my god."  Austin said and started to pat Alan's back, "I did not need to hear that."
"I never want to hear those things." Alan said finally breathing, "Fanfic flashback."
"Fanfic?" I asked.
"Yep, fanfic." Austin said, "It's something."
"You read fanfic together?" Kellin asked, "Dude that's weird."
"I wanted to see what people were writing about me and Austin decided to stick around and read it with me. Which resulted in him making me read it aloud."
"That's still weird." He said.
"Almost as weird as you wondering if Vic is an animal in bed." He shot back.
"Well have you seen him? It's hard not to wonder."
I smirked, "He has a point." I said and looked at Kellin. " And to answer your question yes."
"I don't think we need to know that." Austin said, "No one cares how you are in bed."
"I do!" Kellin said and started to blush.
"Kells." Alan muttered, "Stop it."
"Why? I bet you wonder if Austin is like he is in that fanfic you read."
"No I don't think about it. I know what I'm working with anyway." He said and blushed.
"Oh really?" Kellin asked wiggling his eyebrows.
"Nope, I was kidding."
'"No he's not, " Austin said laughing. "According to him I'm a pretty big deal."
"Austin. Shut up."
"Oh my." Kellin said while I just shook my head. I did not need to know that.
"It was an accident! And we weren't even going out yet!"
"Wait so Austin got naked for you before you even started dating?" I asked.
"You could say that."
"Austin! He forgot his clothes and dropped his towel just as I opened my curtain for my bunk! I didn't mean to!" Alan whined.
"He called me a big deal."
"Austin will you just let it go oh my god." Alan said covering his face.
"No, I'm never letting it go."
"Why not?"
"I think it's funny to tell people."
"It's embarrassing." He muttered and Kellin elbowed me.
"Hey babe, you have like ten minutes before your interview is supposed to start."
