Tick.


Tock.



"I...I hear ticking....a clock?" I said under my breath. looking around.


Tick.


Tock.


There is. Wait..no...there are. I feel like there are actually a lot of clocks somewhere in this room. Back then, I only thought there was one because I heard faint ticking...but now that there no other noise besides that...I've become more aware of them. It irks me somehow...


I stood up from my chair and looked around the room. Closing my eyes, I tried to listen carefully. I'm not sure why I suddenly became intent on finding them, really. But...it just feels like...it's something....I was supposed to do...


"Ah." I opened my eyes and turned around and walked a few feet to my right. There was an old looking closet. It was dusty and unkempt, just like the rest of the furniture here. This was the source of all that ticking.


I reached out to pull the handle. "Let's see what we haveâ€”-"



At the exact moment, I heard the door creak open, making me jump. "Ragazza?"




"Eeeep. Luciano." I thought to myself.
Scurrying over back to my seat before he could enter, I waved at him awkwardly. "H-Hey..."


"Yeah, uhm. We're still having a meeting in the other room, sorry if you're...lonely here." Luciano told me, looking away.


Shaking my head, I smiled. "Nah, it's fine, really. What brings you here if your meeting's still ongoing?"


"I'm just here to get some things." he replied, walking over to the same closet I was about to open earlier. Subtly, I peered over a bit to see what he was getting.



It was a large box...


...of clocks.
