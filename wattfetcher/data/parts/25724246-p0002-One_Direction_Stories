"He has some bad bruising on his leg. Whenever we touched it he would whimper. We had him try to walk on it but he wouldn't every put his foot on the ground."

"We'll we will take X-rays to see if it is broken."

"Alright. Thank you."
---------------------------------------
20 minutes later


"Aright it turns out Niall not only broke his leg he also dislocated his knee,tour the ligaments around the knee, tore a muscle in his calf and thigh. He broke his leg in four place. His tibia and fibula. Also his ankle and part of the bone higher in his thigh. He his going to have to go into surgery for the thigh, and his knee ligaments and fibula."

"Alright when should he get the surgery?"

"I would say he should get it today. We actually have an opening now if you want to get it done now."

"Alright we will do it now."

"Alright."
--------------------------------------

2 1/2 hours later

"Niall Horan Payne-Malik."

"How is he?" Liam asked

"He is good. The surgery went great he will have a very long healing process. But other than that he will be fine."

Zayn then asked "How long is the healing process?"

"That is about 6 to 10 months."

"Alright. Can we see him?"
"Yes right this way." When they got to Niall's room he was sleeping nice and soundly. 15 minutes later they got to take him home. But he was still sleeping.
------------------------------

The next morning when Liam and Zayn woke up they both went to check on their kids together. First stop was Louis who was just waking up.

"Hey, Lou."

"Hi, Papa. Hi, Daddy."

"Can we talk to you."

"Yeah, sure."

Liam started. "Yesterday when I came into the family room and Ni was crying. Why was he crying? And how did he hurt his leg?"

"Umm... Yesterday... Niall was being good. He was playing with his toys just like you told him to, Harry was coloring but he decided that he would go play with Ni, and Harry took the toy that Niall was playing with right out of his hands. Niall told Harry to give it back, but he didn't listen. So Niall came over to me but I didn't listen, and told him that I didn't care. Then I pushed him down, off the couch," by this point Louis was in the verge of tears. "I didn't mean for him to get hurt. Papa, I didn't want him to get hurt. I didn't know, he was hurt, I promise!" Louis told his Daddy and Papa.
