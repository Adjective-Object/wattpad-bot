Blake's p.o.vWe were all on the ship to beacon
academy and I saw him for a split
second when I glanced up from my
book.immediately I looked back
up,have my eyes deceived me?was
this boy going to be in my school
possibly and most likely distracting
me from gaining knowledge at beacon
I think I'm in love I thought, but I couldn't fall
for him though because I didn't work so hard
to get here where I am to lose it all
because of a boy,who I
wouldn't even know if he would even trust
me if he knew about my secrets.The
first secret that I am a Faunus which
is a race of humanoid people who
posses physical animal traits. For
example since I am a Faunus I have
my cat ears.
and my second secret is that I Blake
belladonna was once a member of
the white fang,and once peaceful
organization but now uses violent
means to counter the perceived and
discrimination that Faunus receive
from humans.I still support the white
fang and don't thing they deserve the
discrimination they receive but they
do not need to protest with such
violent acts.
But anyways I need to focus on my
school work and not boys because I
am here to fight the enemy which are
monsters known simply as Grimm
They are described as "creatures of
destruction" and lack a soul hence
they are unable to use Aura. They are
also drawn to feelings of negativity;
such as envy, sadness, loneliness,
and hatred; often congregating
towards the source of these
emotions.At one point, ancient cultures
believed that Grimm were animals
possessed by evil spirits, or were the
spirits of once tortured animals.
That's why me and a group of new
students are heading to beacon
academy on this aircraft so we can
learn to fight the Grimm that have
overcome our world.
I think if we only killed one Grimm a
day it would make such a difference.
