Ashley's Pov:
We were hit by a garbage truck.  Cam was driving, Nash was in the passenger seat.  Matt was behind Cam and I was behind Nash.  The truck hit the back of the car, my side. So that means I was hit worst.
I hear the sirens.  I can't open my eyes.  I can't move anything.
"Everyone ok?"  Nash asked.
Cam and Matt responded yeah.  I didn't say anything.
"Ashley?!"  Nash panicked.
"Her heart is still beating."  Matt said putting his hand against my heart.
Then, everything went black.
Matt's Pov:
All of a sudden, I hear sirens.  There was rumbling, then I saw people getting us out of the car.
One of the guys had to pick up Ashley because she fainted.  I really hope she's ok.
I'm so worried about her.  She's so fragile and delicate.  I don't know if she will last.  But again, I hope she does.

It's been two hours.  Nash, Cam, Ashley and I have to share a room because almost all of the rooms here were full.  Then again, there are only 4 floors to this hospital.
Ashley hasn't responded.  Nash is freaking out, I'm freaking out, and Cam is freaking out while trying to calm all of us down.
All of a sudden I hear a small, weak voice.  "Matt?"
I instantly turn my head to see Ashley looking at me, her eyes were half closed, her make up and hair was messed up but she still looked beautiful.
I get up from my bed and sit on Ashley's bed with her.
"How are you feeling?"  I asked her.  Nash and Cam came to sit with us.
"I feel tired."  She whispered.
"I bet.  I'm glad you're ok."  Nash says.
"Yeah."  Her soft voice says.  Just then, a doctor came into the room.  Nash, Cam and I went back to our beds.
"I have some news for you Ashley, you..."
