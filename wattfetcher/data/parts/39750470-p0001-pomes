I have so much to say But yet when i see you I have no words Ever time you come To mind i tell my self I am done thinking about You but yet 2mins later There you are in my head I dont understand how you Can be so ok when It's so easy to see i Am breaking  apart right In front of you But then again i do Keep it pretty  together But i also dont know If thats what your doing Keeping it together Well i guess we Will never know becuase We know we will Never talk so we Just got to keep liveing
