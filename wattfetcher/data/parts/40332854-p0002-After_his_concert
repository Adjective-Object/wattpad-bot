JoeAfter I pulled Julia backstage I took her to my dressing room and we talked for what felt like hours. She said she was a huge fan and absolutely loved my music. She didn't freak out like other fans do when they are talking to me, I really like that side of her. She's sweet, funny, gorgeous, and talented. Did I mention that she sings? She told me when we were talking that she sung "Hot N Cold" in eighth grade in front of the whole entire student body without being asked to perform. I found that amazing, I mean a lot of people have stage fright.. She told me she did, but she quickly got over her fear and kept doing what she loved. I've had a very hard time falling in love since Blanda and I broke up, but now I feel like I'm falling in love all over again....with the girl of my dreams.
