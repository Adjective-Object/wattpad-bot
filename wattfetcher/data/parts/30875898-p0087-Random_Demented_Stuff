Once upon a time, I looked into her eyes
And I saw a broken girl, beaten down by the world
Once upon a time, I looked into his eyes
And I saw a scarred up boy, tired of feeling destroyed
Once upon a time, I looked into her beautiful eyes
And I couldn't believe, anyone could ever ignore her crys
Once upon a time, I looked into his gorgeous eyes
And I couldn't believe, anyone could ignore his lies
Once upon a time, I looked into her sad eyes
And I loved the way, the tears glistened off of her face
Once upon a time, I looked into his blood shot eyes
And I loved the way, the red covered up his face
Once upon a time, those two looked in each others eyes
And they found a life, they found a light
Once upon a time, there were two who couldn't see with their eyes
They couldn't see a reason to live, but now they've found their bliss
