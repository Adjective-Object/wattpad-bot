I sat on my bed remembering how much I had changed over the summer. Visiting my cousin over in Malibu had definitely changed me a lot.I had ditched the thick rimmed glasses that had hidden my emerald green eyes and replace them with contacts. My pale skin had developed a slight tan and my once dull and lifeless  brown hair had gone under treatment leaving behind luscious and lively locks. Also having gotten my braces removed the month before, and losing the baby fat I had become some goddess. I smiled at my reflection in the mirror,  "Watch out California, Kaitlyn Gerald is on her way." I looked around my room and fell asleep.  Tomorrow would be a new day with new beginnings.
