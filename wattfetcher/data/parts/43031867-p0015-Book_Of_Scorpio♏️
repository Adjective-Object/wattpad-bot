If Scorpio was a drug, they would be Heroin. Just like Scorpio, they're both hardcore and addictive. Heroin suppress pain just like Scorpio suppresses their pain, but just like the crash, a Scorpio's emotion eventually comes out in an explosion. Everything they feel is in great intensity, so they either feel really good or really bad about things. They have an all or nothing mentality, and they can be pretty obsessive.
