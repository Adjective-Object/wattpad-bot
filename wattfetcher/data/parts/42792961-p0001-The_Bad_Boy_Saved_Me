He promised he'd come back, he's never broken a promise. I honestly don't know where he went, no one does. He just left one night and told me he promises he will be back, well where are you now dad? Where did you run off to ten years ago? now I finally broke out of my shell of hope, sitting at the window, looking out, waiting for him to drive back into the driveway with his rusty SUV. It's been ten years, I'm now sixteen and where is he? not here, like he promised.My dad was the only one that understood me when I was sad, mad, happy, scared, confused, everything, he always understood. Now he's gone and just left my mom and I to worry and struggle in our small, old, blue house, that we've lived in since I could remember.My dad's name is David Lee Raven, my mom's is Leanne Rose Raven and mine... Rylee Giselle Raven. We are, well were, the happy family called the Raven's that live on Traine drive, in a small place we call home; Charlee Village. A new family just moved into the house across the road, this is now the fourth family to be moving into that house ever since I was born, just proves how long we've lived here. The new family if a family of three, an older woman, an older man both probably around my mothers age and parents of the third person that got out if the car, a boy, my age or a year older. Great, another boy to be annoying around here, I already have to deal with Travis, a guy in my Math and English class, and also lives down the street from me. Just Perfect.
