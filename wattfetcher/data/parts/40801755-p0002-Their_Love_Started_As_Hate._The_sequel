"No, no, no," I cried "what is it now?" My brother asked walking into the living room, "Toby and spencer can't break up they are made for each other, no," I cried
"It's stupid Emily, why do you even watch shit like that," I snapped my head up from of the sofa and pointed at him. "don't you dare disrespect pretty little liars, or A will come get you,"
He rolled his eyes and walked out, I switched the TV off and picked up my phone,

Okay so me and Rose sort of became best friends it's been a year since the 'break up,' I haven't talked to him since,
My dad is changing the school from an all boys to a normal university after the fire, he wanted to mix, it might be something to do with me and Mark,
I don't know but school starts next Monday, new classes, new year, new everything basically, but I don't get a dorm because I have here I hope.
***Monday, 18th of February, school, fuck.
I got up early, got to make a good first impression, right? New girls there, New boys *winks mentally* I have gone crazy.
I took a long hot shower, I was going to see him again wow, a year, I still cry, okay stop thinking about him,
I jumped out and went to my wardrobe, I grabbed a pair of black lace pants, and a black white bra, I put on my black leggings, a white shirt and I tucked it in and pulled it out a little, I blow dried my hair and curled it, and started to do my make up, it was black smoky eye eye liner and, my foundation etc, I lined my lips and put in red lipstick.
A pair of tan pop socks and my lace up heel booties, I grabbed my Victoria Beckham bag and a black Wool coat that was mid length so it was down to my waist and leather inside, I put on a necklace with a dream catcher in it the feather was black and grabbed my gold iPhone 6, working really paid off, my dad bought me the phone for Christmas.
I was ready, I walked down the stairs and out into the rain I shoved my umbrella up and started walking to school, it was a five minute walk do it was good.
I stepped onto campus and the noise of girls laughing and boys greeting each other filled my ears, it was a nice feeling, I walked up getting wolf whistled at, I smiled at them and walked past I seen rose, and I gave her a hug, she was wearing a white and browny creamy colour crop top, black skinny jeans, roushe runs and her make up was simple, her hair was wavy and a strand was French braided across her head,
She held on to her leather biker jacket as the wind blew, "maybe we should go in?" I asked, she nodded in reply and we went to the big hall where announcements where made,
I seen my dad approach the mic as me and rose sat done and everyone quieted down, he cleared his throat,
