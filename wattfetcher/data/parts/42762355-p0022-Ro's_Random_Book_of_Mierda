Maybe someday I will be able to touch my face and feel healthy skin... Maybe I will be able to touch my back without being disgusted of myself... Shit how I hate to be a teenager. I hate it that I can't remember the time when I had a perfect skin... I know I had. Now it feels pretty much impossible. Fuck you too acne.
