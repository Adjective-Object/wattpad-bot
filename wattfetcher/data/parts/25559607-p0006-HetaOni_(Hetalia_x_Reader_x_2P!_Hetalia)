Obtained: Onigiri
Then some creepy-ass killer music plays and Steve just dashes towards Japan.
Was it because he took the onigiri?
The Thing then attacks Japan and then they battle. After the battle, the door seems to be locked.
Dangit, Japan! In this time of need???
The key was dropped somewhere. Don't worry, the Thing slowed down.
I then dashed Japan over to the upper left side of the library to pick up the key that he dropped.. Even if he never went over there. .___.
========
J: I found it! It's the key!Now I have to get out of here!
Retrieved: Key.
As I got to the door, a menu popped out asking if I want to use the key to go out.
========"Oh mein gott! Of course, dammit! Now let Japan out of thhheeeerreee!" I exclaimed as I opened a pack of chips forcefully for unnecessary dramatic effect.Â ========
Got away safely!~
J: ...Wha...What on Earth was THAT thing?!
I have to find the others as soon as possible.

Someone knocked on my door.
"______? Are you ready to go?" Mom asked from the other side of the door.
"Uh..Y-Yep! Just let me shut down my laptop and I'm good to go!" I said.
"Okay. Be down in 15 minutes." She said. Footsteps could be heard going down the stairs.
I saved my game, shut my laptop down, changed clothes and gathered my stuff.
I gave my room another look before I go. Then I saw something.
My cupcake!
I rushed towards the pink pastry and took a bite from it. Oh my god. These are so delicious. I gotta thank mom when I get down.
As I went downstairs, everyone was getting ready to go.
I settled my bag down and went to the kitchen to get a drink. I saw my mom was there, too. She was checking some stuff to make sure she didn't leave anything important.
I poured myself a glass of water and turned to my mother. "Oh, by the way... Thanks for the delicious cupcake you gave me, mom!" I said cheerfully.
She then had a puzzled look on her face. "What cupcake? I didn't make any." She said as I was drinking.
Wh-What?!
I almost spit out my drink.
"I-It must be, Dad..." I told her. I rushed to the front door where my father was.
"Dad, you were the one who gave me the pink cupcake, right?" I asked him nervously.
"A cupcake? No, dear. I didn't." He replied.
I was suddenly freaked out. "Then who on earth gave me that delicious cupcake?!" I said with a frustrated tone. My father then looked at me sympathetically.
"Let's not worry about that now, ______. You said it was delicious, right?" He asked.
I nodded weakly.
"Then praise the Lord! It might be a gift from above!" He exclaimed, nudging me with his elbow.
