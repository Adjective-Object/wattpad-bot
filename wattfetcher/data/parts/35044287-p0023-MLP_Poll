Finally Winter Wrap Up is out! Out of all the songs on the list this is my least favorite. Mainly cause it's one of those songs that get annoying very quickly. Anyway you know the drill. If you voted this song out then you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!!

And the nominees are:

TRUE TRUE FRIEND

WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME

LET THE RAINBOW REMIND

HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN

BATS

CRYSTAL BALLAD

FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES

WELCOME TO THE SHOW

SHAKE YOUR TAIL

SHINE LIKE RAINBOWS

PERFECT DAY FOR FUN

Good luck to the nominees
