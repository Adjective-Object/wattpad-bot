"Shh.. She's waking," I heard some accented guy say in my sleep. I couldn't tell if it was a dream or not, but this is the most comfortable I've ever been since I ran away. I didn't want to leave the bed. So I just kept my eyes closed for a few more minutes.
I kept hearing guys talking. So I decided to open my eyes. I turned my head to the right and there stood four guys, and one of them was Niall.
"Who are you?" I groggily asked them. I have to admit it, they're all pretty attractive.
"I'm Liam," One spoke.
"I'm Zayn," A guy with black hair waved and smiled at me.
"And I'm Louis,"
"Well, you know me," Niall chuckled. I'm not sure if I'm just really tired or there is actually four guys staring at me right now.
"So, you're all here because?" I questioned.
"Um.." Louis started to say, but Zayn finished for him, "We want you to live with us."
"What? I'm not sure I understood you correctly. You want me, a homeless stranger, to live with you four guys?"
"Niall knows you," Liam laughed.
"Okay, but why me? Why not some other person living on the streets?" I wondered. They could've asked any homeless being, in fact they didn't have to ask anyone, but they chose me.
"Um.." Louis said once again, "It's nothing important."

I sat in the back of their car with Zayn and Louis while Liam sat in the passenger side and Niall drove. I haven't been in a car for three years. It feels so weird.
"To be honest, your gorgeous," Zayn whispered in my ear out of no where. I shivered at his closeness. I've never had a guy compliment me or even be so near me.
"M-Me? I'm not. I smell terrible, my face is covered in filth from the streets, I-"
He interrupted me before I'm could finish, "It doesn't matter. It's not your fault."
"What? Of course it is. I chose to run away," I whispered.
"And how does that make it your fault?"
"I.. I don't know," I stopped myself and decided not to argue.

We all entered the apartment one by one. I was last. On the couch, sat a man with curly hair, I couldn't see his face though. Until he turned around. Wait, that's the guy who saved me from Brock last week. He didn't seem happy when he looked at me. He looked super angry.
"Who the fuck is that?" He glared at me and I looked away.
Niall started to answer, "The girl you always-"
"Why did you bring a dirty bum into the apartment? She doesn't belong here," he growled.
"Harry, don't play this game with us,"
Harry? As in Niall's friend? His friend who wanted me to stop starving? I'm in a world of confusion now.
"What game? I'm not playing anything. You're the one bringing a homeless freak here. Not me,"
I almost started to cry. Why is he saying such mean things if he was the one asking Niall to give me food and drink everyday?
"Lennon, go take a shower while we talk to Harry. Okay?" Niall gave me a sympathetic smile. I think he noticed my uneasiness.
I really wanted to hear this conversation, "I-"
