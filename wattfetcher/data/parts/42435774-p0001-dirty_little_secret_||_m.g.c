The ringing sounded, making me jump up a little in shock. I was, rather unfortunately, sat below the loud school bell, that was just signalling the start of lunch break.
Stretching, Luke, Calum and I stood up from our seats, wandering out the small classroom door and into the vastly filled corridor that was crowded yet unusually empty, for Eastbrook high anyway.Normally you couldn't move and had to walk at an intensely slow pace to get ten meters away from a certain point. But today was different... Although it was still difficult to move, there were no geeks being shoved into lockers, there were no freshman running around trying to find their classes, and most of all... There were hardly any teachers about.
I glanced at Luke with a raised eyebrow, who just shrugged his shoulders and walked out to the field where I caught the eye of Casey and Rena, who beckoned us over with a wide smile.
I stripped myself of my jacket as I smiled at the boy, his hair fluffed up like normal. It was hard to believe this guy was the most talented football player in the city, he appeared like a large teddy bear yet was lethal on the pitch.
He patted Calum's shoulder "Hey big man" he laughed, letting his finger run briefly over the new tattoo he had recently got on his arm "I still don't get it..." He laughed again.
Calum rolled his eyes with a small chuckle "its an Indian you idiot... Like a general". Casey's eyes lit up
"Oh like the guy in Pocahontas?!"
"Oh my fuck Casey... Are you sure you're not gay?!" I laughed upon seeing his pout.
"Oh look, here's Ash" Luke finally spoke up, making us all glance over to the blonde/brown haired boy, accompanied by another boy with fluorescent red hair "And he's brought a friend"
