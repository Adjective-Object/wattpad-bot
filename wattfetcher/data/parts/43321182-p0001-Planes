Isabelle's pov
Hi my Isabelle I have a step sister that I can't stand sometimes, she is way too loud and I think she is copying my style.
Anyways we have a lot in common we hang out in the same group and we have the same music type, she has a evil side and a sweet side but the sweet side only comes around when my step-mom and dad are around.
But let's get back to reality we both think our dad hates us because here is why he hits us and treats us like crap but he is totally different when my stepmom is around and I hate it.
Then tomorrow is the first day of school, I'm not that happy about that cause of the drama but on the only good thing about it is that I get to see Jack...
