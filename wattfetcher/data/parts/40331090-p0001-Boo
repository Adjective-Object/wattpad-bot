For @esther_oh :D
"Come in" whispered a lady in a shaky yet threatening voice. I threw my head back and shrieked like a toddler. Who was she?! More importantly, what was she doing in MY house?!!! I tried to calm down and get a grip of myself but an icy cold hand got a grip of me first...
The hand shook my shoulder while the floor swallowed my legs, leaving my body suspended held up by her firm grip. That's when I saw the spoon in her other hand, dripping while leaving a puddle of blood on the floor. Just the sight of it made my blood run cold. ðŸ™‰ðŸ˜±
