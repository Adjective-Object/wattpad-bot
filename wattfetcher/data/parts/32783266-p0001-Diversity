what does it mean
Pain, Screams thats all I hear. Everything stops; The room is solid cold, not a single movment. Cries of pain and tears wakes up everyone. I stop to breath but suffocate on my own air. Its as if im drowning. Asoon as I know it, Gentile, gentile, a gentile hand grabs me carfully and holds on to me with might but cares so much it doesn't hurt but because the reason it does hurt is for their care.
"Breath"
"Breath"
The soft voice whispers sweetly into my ear.
"Breath" It says once more as it becomes clear.
"One Two,
Three Four,
let your pain out the door.
Five six,
seven eight,
keep calm for your days are bright." She chants peacfully.
"Mom?" I ask.
"Yes?" She responds.
"im scared." I said in weak tones and sorrowfull eyes.
"Tell me. What happend this time." She asked looking at me with emeralds in her eyes.
"The chant..." I said with wounded lips.
"What chant?" She puts her hand on my salted cheeks.
"One-Two
One-Two
Three-Four
Your not the same
Your not little anymore
Five-Six
seven-Eight
So quit your tears
Your too late
what does it mean!?" My Grey eyes glow to her in dispare.
"I dont know." She says as she embraces me in a hug.
The room is quiet for a while. My whole world stops and i wish it would stay like this forever.
"Dont let go."Â I whisperd into her ear.
