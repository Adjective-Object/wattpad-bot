Bella hoists Dax into the ute tray and I clip him in. Before I can do anything Bella grabs my hand and gives me a nervous smile, "Are you sure you want to come with me, this is dangerous. You can start new without me, meet a new girl..." I say, "I don't want you getting hurt"
"So I can do this with her?"
"Do wha-...?" Before I can finish Bell is on me, kissing me and dragging me towards the ute door. She pushes me into the drivers seat and climbs in after me, sitting on my lap facing me. Pinning me under her, her knees either side, her hands on the shoulder rests of my seat and she's sitting on my lap.
"I must admit I would miss this, but you'd be safe" I say even though I don't want her to stop
"I'm not leaving you, I'd miss this to much" she replies with a smirk "Come on, let's make this quick"
