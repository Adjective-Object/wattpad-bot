Yknow. At my funeral they'll say what I did do. That I played volleyball or that a was an honor roll student with a 4.7 GPA.But they won't say what I didn't do. That I didn't try to live, didn't accept help, didn't move on, those kinds of things. It's strange. Everyone's always so focused on what people did do, the good or bad, that they try to cover up what they didn't. They mess up who you are by doing that. By making you actions and not a person.
