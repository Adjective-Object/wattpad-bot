I got ready to go to the beach with my brother and his friends.  "Amber,  hurry up!" Jackson yelled "or I'll leave"
"Chill,  Jack i know you've been waiting to see Madison in a bikini but spare me some time here " I yelled back agitated.
I was trying to look my best to impress Cameron because I've had a crush on him since forever. I rushed down stairs and punched him on the arm. He winced" What was that for? "
" rushing me" I smirked and walked out the house. I was the last person to get Shawn's car. After I closed the door he drove away.
"Can you turn on the radio? " Taylor suggested.  Shawn turned it on to a random station.  It was giving Fire N Gold by Bea Miller
"Fire N Gold"
Like an astronaut that's scared of heightsWith a heart that's beating at the speed of lightYou've been waiting for this feeling all your lifeSometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a momentAnd your spark has been stolenThis is our time to own itSo own it
Baby, we were born withFire & gold in our eyes, eyesWith fire & gold in our eyes, eyesGot lightning in a bottleHands on the throttleEven in the dust we shineWith fire & gold in our eyes
There is something different about you and I (about you and I)And I feel like I have known you my whole lifeThere is beauty behind every tear you've criedSometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a momentAnd your spark has been stolenThis is our time to own itSo own it
Baby, we were born withFire & gold in our eyes, eyesWith fire & gold in our eyes, eyesGot lightning in a bottleHands on the throttleEven in the dust we shineWith fire & gold in our eyes
There is love inside this madnessWe are walking on the moonThough I don't believe in magicI believe in me and youI believe in me and youI believe in me and you
Baby, we were born withFire & gold in our eyes, eyesWith fire & gold in our eyes, eyesGot lightning in a bottleHands on the throttleEven in the dust we shineWith fire & gold in our eyes
Shawn was singing like there was no tomorrow as well as my idiot brother.  He attempted the high notes and failed all. Finally we got the beach before they could start singing again. Cameron was already there waiting against his car. I bit my lip and straightened the dress I had over my bikini.  I lifted it over dress and put it on my shoulder. Cam smirked and walked over to us.
"I'd been waiting for 10 minutes " He said and Jack explained to him" Amber took forever to get dressed" I rolled my eyes and went to set up my towel on the sand. I placed my bag down and got out my sunscreen. I rubbed it on my front side but couldnt get to my back side.
"Need help?" someone asked from behind.  I turned around it was Cameron.
"Yes,  please" I smiled. He took the bottle and poured it on his hands and rubbed them together.  He massaged it on my back and legs. It felt so good but looked wrong. At some point I actually moaned.
"oh,  you like that " He said with a smirk plastered on his face.
" Shh,"I hushed him "Are you done yet?"
