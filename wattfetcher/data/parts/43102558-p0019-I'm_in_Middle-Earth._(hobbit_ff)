Goblin King's dead body fell on top of them. I held back a laugh. We ran out of the tunnels. We continued to run until we were close to a cliff. We stopped to catch our breath. "Where is Bilbo?" Gandalf wondered. The dwarves argued with each other. Thorin accused Bilbo of leaving.
"No I'm right here." Bilbo came out.
Everyone questioned Bilbo. I left it alone not caring what happened to him. I was just glad to have the burglar back. The sound of wargs filled my ears. One of them was a pale orc who rode a white warg. Michelle, we need your help. I thought hoping that she heard.
I'm close. Don't attack the blue dragon that you will see in a few minutes. Michelle thought back.
