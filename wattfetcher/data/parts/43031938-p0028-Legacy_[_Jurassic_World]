"He's been cleaning it out then." Owen said. Keira nodded.
"He's hiding something."
"I'm not trying to jump to conclusions but it definitely looks that way."
"What is he up to?" Owen growled.

Lowery looked up to the parents.
"You want me to what?" he asked.
"Recover the deleted emails." Keira said.
"On Theo's laptop?"
She nodded.
"Why?"
"Because Theo is doing something he shouldn't be and is hiding it."
"What makes you think that?"
Keira explained the emails. " ....And with his recent behaviour, we have to figure out what he's up to."
"Well, that does seem odd but don't you think maybe he thought you guys would go through his emails and maybe he was discussing something private to his pen pal that he didn't want you to read?"
"What would he discu- Oh!" Keira said before scrunching up her nose. "No, no I don't want to think about that." she shook her head.
"It's plausible." Owen said. "But I don't think that's the case here Lowery."
"You guys haven't been wrong yet." Lowery said. "I'll look into it, okay?"
"Thank you Lowery, you're the best!" she hugged him tightly. Lowery smiled as Owen cleared his throat. Lowery raised his hands quickly as Owen grinned and walked off.

Theo sat before his laptop staring at the screen. His hand was grazing over the touch pad as the computer arrow hovered over the send button. He let out a groan looking up the ceiling before looking down and over to his night stand. There was a picture of him with his parents when he was only two years old. He was standing in front of a young Apatosaurus with his hand outstretched trying to touch it.
He reached out and touched his finger to it before placing the picture frame face down. He looked back to the computer and clicked send.
"It's gonna work, you guys will see."
