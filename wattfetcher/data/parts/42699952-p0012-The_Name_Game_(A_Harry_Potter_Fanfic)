"Potter, Harry!"
Harry nervously walked up to the stool and sat down. I looked over at Hermione, who was already seated next to Ron at the Gryffindor table. I hope I make it with them. I hope. I couldn't hear what was happening with the hat on Harry's head, mostly because I was phasing out, but I did hear something about Slytherin when the hat yelled out, "BETTER BE GRYFFINDOR!"
The Gryffindor table had an uproar of applause as Harry sat down with them. I didn't hear McGonagall when she called my name at first.
"M, Domino." She said. People raised their eyebrows in the crowd and I tripped up to the podium, gathering myself and sitting down. The heat began to speak.
Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you ever since your father left this school. Let's see, I assume that it is not my duty to tell you your full name.
Wait, you know it?
Yes, Miss M, I know your name very well. Your father... He was a very successful student, indeed. Shall you follow in your father's footsteps?
Why can't you tell me my name?!
Persistent, are we? You and your father share many characteristics, but alas, you are very, very different from him. I suppose that legend will be heard when time comes. For now, you'd be the best in...
"GRYFFINDOR!"
The table cheered once again, and I hopped off the stool and made my way to the table, sitting down next to Harry. He squeezed my hand under the table as people congratulated me, especially the Weasleys and their friends. A few more people were sorted, including Draco (who almost knew he'd be in Slytherin from birth) and Luna Lovegood. I liked Luna, but it surprised me when she was sorted into Ravenclaw.
Dumbledore gave a quick speech, then said in his booming voice, "Let the feast commence!" And a buttload of food appeared from thin air in front of us. I spooned on a little bit and began picking.
"So, how does it feel to make Gryffindor?" Harry asked.
"You would know as well as I know." I shrugged, looking at him. He smiled.
"It feels awesome."
