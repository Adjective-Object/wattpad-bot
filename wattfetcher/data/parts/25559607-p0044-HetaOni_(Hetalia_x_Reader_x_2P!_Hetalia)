I suddenly waved the screen away. "Oh god, I gotta help Canada."
I went downstairs and rushed to the library England was in.
"E-England!! Help! It seems like Canada fainted!" I told him frantically.
The Briton dropped the book he was reading. "W-What? Where is he?"
"He's still in the piano room!" I told him.
"Okay. I'm going over there." England said as he rushed out the library.
I knew that Canada's not really in danger, so I didn't rush over there as panicked as England. I took the opportunity to reflect on some things. ...I think...maybe I should tell them what I know. Which one? Where should I start? Should I tell them everything? Maybe I should tell them about the rope ladder before the Thing gets to it? Yes...maybe I should... It's for the best...
I was about to leave the room, when I suddenly felt arms wrap around me.
I was shocked. "W-What the..." I couldn't turn my head to see who was...hugging me. I squirmed to get myself released.
The person behind me suddenly spoke, "Now now, poppet. Are you sure you want me to stop hugging you. It's very relaxing." The man started to giggle.
My eyes widened. ...He called me...."Poppet"...
No...
No way...
They're...they're not part of this!
"...Please...let me go..." I asked of him.
I suddenly shivered when he nuzzled his head on the crook of my neck.
"Who are you asking to let you go, poppet?" He asked playfully.
I bit my lip and prayed that I would be wrong. Though it'll be just like when I met Japan. But this...this is different... This guy's equally...if not..more..dangerous than the monsters here.
I began to open my mouth and spoke softly.
"Please...let me go...England."
He let me go and made me face him. I looked down. I didn't want to confirm my fears.
"I've watched you, poppet. I've also learned that in your world, I have a name of my own. A name I do not share with that grumpy man~" He told me cheerfully.
"............O-Ol.." I said under my breath.
"Come on now, poppet. Tell me~."
He then cupped my chin and made me look at him in the eyes.
I saw two blue orbs that had swirls of pink.
He smiled at me like a cheshire cat. I took a deep breath and spoke weakly,
"Oliver."
