Hey y'all! Excuse any mistakes and give me feed back.
Lauren's POV
"Hello." I said dryly as I answered my phone.
"Baby I been calling you all evening." Devin said through the phone.
"I was asleep." I told him.
"Okay. Well I'm off of work." He said.
"Alright." I said getting out of bed.
"I'm gonna take you and the kids out tonight."
"The kids aren't here." I told him.
"Well where are they?" He asked.
"They are at my mothers."
"Well baby why didn't you consult me first? You know, about them staying." He asked.
"I didn't really think about it." I said honestly.
"Alright. Well how about just you and I? Since I can't have my kids I'll take my wife out." He said.
"Wow! Thanks for letting me know I'm second choice." I rolled my eyes.
"Baby now you know I didn't mean it like that" he said laughing lightly.
"Mmhm." I said washing my face after putting him on speaker.
"What you doing?" He asked.
"Washing my face. I'll be ready when you get here D." I said.
"Alright cool." He said and we hung up.
I got showered up and dressed afterwards. More than likely we will go some place casual.
I went downstairs after filling in my eyebrows a bit, adding mascara and lipgloss.
"You look beautiful." Devin said meeting me at the door.
I smiled. "Really?" I asked him looking down at the tan playsuit I decided to wear.
"Hell yes." He said kissing my lips.
"Where we going? Should I take off the wedges?" I asked looking up at him.
"No, you can leave em on if you're comfortable." He told em.
"Alright. You still didn't answer my question." I said.
"And I don't plan on it. Come on." He said and grabbed my hand.
"I got you these." He said reaching in the backseat of his bmw.
"Aw!" I said seeing that he had a bouquet of flowers for me.
"You like em?" He asked me.
"Yes of course." I said putting them up to my nose. "You tryna get brownie points so you can get some huh?" I asked him.
He laughed. "It wasn't even like that but if you're willing.." He trailed off.
"I don't know. It depends on how well this date goes." I said smirking.
"Aren't all the dates I take you on good?" He asked.
"Yeah." I nodded.
"Exactly so don't be like that."
"Don't get smart Devin. I'm mad at you." I pouted.
"Oh yeah? When are you not." He muttered.
I glared at him, and looked threw the window pretending not to hear him.
I can't even be mad at the statement he made. That's honestly how it feels sometimes. Like I'm always upset and stressed or worried. Always.
