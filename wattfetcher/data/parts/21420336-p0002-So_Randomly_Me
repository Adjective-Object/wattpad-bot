So I read this image about Percy Jackson and YOLO.
It went like this;
Percy: What does Y.O.L.O mean?
Annabeth: Y.O.L.O is a ~insert big word I can't spell here~ that means,"You Only Live Once" basically, your flirting with death.
Nico: Well hello there! *flirts eyelashes flirtasiously*
My reaction to this:
Me: YOLO YOLO YOLO
Nico: heyyyy
Me: OMG OMG OMG HE SAID HEY TO ME WHAT DO I SAY?!??
Nico: ... You could say,"Hello Nico how are you?"
Me: Hi Yolo
Nico: *smirks*
Me:..... *stares off into space looking like this* @.@
Nico: yeah well she's gone umm so she will be back sooner or later let me just get the supplies to get her out of this trance....
Nico: *leaves and comes back with: Bazooka, bomb, books, dolphins, tank, drawings, anime, and water* hopefully this is enough....
Nico: SO BYE BYE EVERYONE SHE WILL BE BACK LATER!!
[A/N so sadly I don't own Nico, Annabeth, or Percy all rights go to *sigh* Rick Riordan
Lucky guy.... ]

OMG....look at the size of that duck. *starts chasing the duck* COME BACK HERE YOU FUCKING STALLION DUCK.
