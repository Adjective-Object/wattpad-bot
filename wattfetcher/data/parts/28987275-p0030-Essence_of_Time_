"Hi girls. Here to see Vaughn?" he asked.
"Yes Sir," Serena answered. "Is he in his office?"
"Yes. And Porter's back there, too. I think they're discussing the Chamberlayne case," Frankie said. He directed his attention to me. "I'm really sorry about Savannah, Nora. All of us here are helping in any way we can."
"Thanks, Frankie. I appreciate it," I responded. Our trio waved before going back to Mr. Vaughn's office. Serena knocked, and Mr. Vaughn gestured for us to come in.
"Hey girls. What brings you down to the precinct today?" he asked, smiling.
Serena hopped onto his desk and sat on the edge like I've seen her do a thousand times before. "We wanted to talk to you about something school related. Do you have a minute?"
"I have all the time in the world for the three of you," he replied. I loved Mr. Vaughn like a second father. Serena was an only child, but after we all met in Kindergarten, we'd grown up to be like sisters. Jasmine and I were kind of like Mr. and Mrs. Vaughn's daughters from other mothers. "Let me finish up with Detective Porter and then we can go to Coffee & Toffee to talk. Sound like a plan?"
The three of us nodded. "Yes Sir," Serena replied. Serena and Jasmine walked out of the room, but I lingered behind for a moment longer. I acknowledged Porter with a nod. The corner of his mouth lifted.
I shut the door behind me. I tried to make out what they were saying, but I couldn't. After two minutes, Detective Porter came out of the room. "All yours, girls. Have a nice afternoon." He nodded at me. "Nora."
"Porter," I said, eyeing him.
Mr. Vaughn exited his office a moment later. "Ready to go?"
