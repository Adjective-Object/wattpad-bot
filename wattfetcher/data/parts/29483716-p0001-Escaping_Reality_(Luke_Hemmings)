So let's begin shall we? I was just fifteen when I was held Captive by these greedy unworthy men. Days like this felt like the ultimate horror story like you know when the chainsaw guy rips his chainsaw alive and breaks down the door? That was how it felt that was how I still feel. It's been six years that I'm still with thess chauvinistic gruesome beings, so yeah I'm 21 now. They changed me well my physical status. How can god have these animals no animals are better. How can god have these butt holes alive? I was once blonde with the name Lianna George but now I'm ginger with the name Juliet Potter. I used to live in hot sunny Vegas now I "live"  in cold rainy England.  This is my life now.  Screw you Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood and Ashton Irwin. But who knows, things might take a turn from here
A/N: hey guys well new story here hope you like it and yes Emm watson is Juliet Potter.
