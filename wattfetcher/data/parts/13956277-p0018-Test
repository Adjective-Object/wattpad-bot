We kept walking for 2 hours ... TWO MORE HOURS !!!!
"Are we there yet" I asked, my feet started to get hurt
mind: Did you have to wear these small shoese ???
me: shut up, they look good with that skirt
mind: Ok, you deserve all that pain
me: Oh please
"one hour left" He breathed rapidly, because we were kinda running
"Ouch" I stepped on some broken glass bottels ...
"What happened" he turned towards me in the speed of light
"nothin, stupid glass"
"L'mme see" he bent down
"No No Im fine" I stepped back
"Oh, you can't walk in these shoese any more, they're torn now"
"It's Ok, Come on" I stood up and walked past him
"Ouch" Probably I stepped on something spiky
"You really can't walk like that, Either I carry you home bridal-style, Or you take my shoese ... but I prefer choice number one" he teased
"Wallah If you didn't know where my house is, I wouldn't have even spoken to you, So either I punch your face so you stop hitting on me or you direct me to the house and leave me alone, and I dont know which choice I prefer more " I said with a stright face though I wasn't looking at him.
me: Astaghferollah, I shouldn't have said that ... I should've been more classy .
mind: Naaaaah  it's fine
"Oh, I see ... but you surely need me, so don't speak to me with that tone again if you want to go home" He chuckled
mind: such a Jerk
me: I agree, He's provoking me, should I punch his face or show him the karate move I showed to Damon when he blocked me ?
mind: No it's improper for a girl like you to get into a fight with a boy like him, just be patiened
"Ya Allah Sabberni" I left without knowing where to go
"Ouch, Ouch, Ouch" my feet ached and got swollen more and more with every step I took
"Hey Hold On" Tom shouted but I ignored him and kept my gaze on the pavement which I could barely see.
"Stop stop" He jumped in front of me, I tried to pass him but he blocked me again
"Just please go away I've had enough today"
"Ok, Im sorry, Take these" He put his shoese in front of me
I giggled sarcastically
"I'm serious, come on get in them" he said seriously
"and how are you gonna walk then " I mocked
"On my legs stupid"
he acts like a gentleman for a second ... then that mouth walks in and blows up everything
"No, thank you Tom" I passed him
"Come on" He pulled my wrist, I froze
"let go of my hand please" I glared at him
"sorry *lets go of my hand*, but turn on that small brain you got, you can't walk like that, your feet are probably bleeding and your shoese are torn. come on, I'm sorry, take these"
