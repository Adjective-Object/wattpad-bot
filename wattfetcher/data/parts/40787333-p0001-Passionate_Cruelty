*Sapphire's POV*While I was sitting in what we call a 'Glorieta', listening to Second Heartbeat by A7x, I looked to the side to find a strange man starring at me from a tree located beside a hospital near my school. He had an Emo haircut, red eyes and a black suit. He also ha a sly smile on his face. Do you wonder how I knew he was looking at me? I was the only one sitting there. I am a loner so I obviously don't have many friends, either. Those are two reasons and the third was that, well,  our eyes met every time I raised mine and I could feel his red eyes burning a hole into the side of my head. Now, I must tell you that I'm really shy around strangers, so it bothers me that he's looking at me; no one's ever taken an interest in me before. I mean, I'm pretty average.I have black hair with white and red highlights, that are actually natural. Weird right? I wouldn't say I'm fat but I wouldn't say I'm skinny, either. I would say I'm a tiny bit chubby. I have brown eyes that look like melting chocolate. People always tell me that they look like the eyes a murderer would have. I have dark circles under my eyes because I have almost chronic insomnia and full lips. That about covers it all. Oh, I have been told that I am one, if not the darkest person in school. I saw him walking closer, while I drew on my journal. He looked to be in his 20's and.... Did I mention that he was the hottest dude I have ever seen?
When he got closer to me, I realized that his eyes had something that made me uncomfortable. I furrowed my eyebrows and stared into his red orbs. When he was a good 5ft away from me , he stopped an tilted his head. I looked down to the picture I was drawing and smiled. L looked so cute with his cake. Not to brag but I have a talent for drawing and singing. And even writing!!
I didn't say my name, right? Silly me. My name is Sapphire Enid, but my little circle of friends call me Sapphie or Enid. My stepdad is Japanese and my mom is puertorrican. Now about my 'little circle of friends', by that I mean that I have a grand total of.... (Drumrolls please) 2 friends!! *Dramatic le gasp* Shocking right? Celeste and Nathalia are my only friends. I met them in a psychiatric hospital when my mom sent me there for depression, cutting an a lot of other shit. Celeste was there for trying to kill someone, while Nathalia was there for depression and suicide attempts. No one wanted to be friends with Celeste because, once in the hospital, she tried to kill her roomate but I was aching to talk to her. I remember a time when she was sitting with us and some girls were talking to her about her being possessed by Zozo (she claimed that she was possessed by a demon called Zozo) and someone said something incredibly stupid, so she said 'juhm, pathetic' in a scary, creepy yet beautiful voice (for me her voice was fascinating). And Nathalia and I became friends relatively fast. We had a lot in common. The three of us became bff's since the experience at the hospital.
Enough about my friends. Let's talk about the black-haired, red-eyed beauty that is now sitting in front of me. "Hello." - The man said simply."Uhm, hi." - I said awkwardly. I didn't like the way he looked at me, at all. I was listening to 'The dreamer' by I the Mighty, when I heard a honk. I turned my torso around to see who it was and my mom was there. OMFZ!! She's finally here!! Thank Lord!! I picked up my things and looked at the man for a moment before turning around and walking towards my mom's car.

When we reached home, I said Good evening to my stepdad and ran upstairs. I had to continue writing my creepypasta story. I promised I would update today and I didn't like to make my readers wait. So I had to finish it. After and hour, I made a pause to eat and then continued writing for another hour and a half, until I was satisfied with the chapter. I uploaded it and proceeded to take a bath. I turned the handle, and the tub started to fill. I took off my sweaty clothing and turned the handle again. I stepped in the tub and lowered myself in the warm water and let out a looooong frustrated sight. I had to think about my future, and when would be a good time to think about that? When there is no one telling me what to do or what I should do with myself. It tires me. I wanted to be a writer but I mostly write fanfiction. I mean, I'm only a junior and 16. And I still don't have a concrete plan on what I'm gonna do with my pathetic life. I want to be either an artist and draw my own manga or be a writer and write amazing stories, like J.K. Rowling, John Green and Jennifer A. Nielsen did. I pondered on this while I finished washing my body. I stepped out of the tub and dried myself. I walked out of the bathroom connected to my room and pulled out a tank top and panties from my dresser. But something seemed off, I just couldn't put my finger on it. So I shrugged it off and pulled the tank top over my head. Didn't I let my computer on? I started walking to my bed, when I felt two strong hands grab me from behind. One was firmly wrapped around my waist and the other one was covering my mouth.
