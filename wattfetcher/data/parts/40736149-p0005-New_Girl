Miracle
We was at a drive thru movie theater i had a big smile on my face because i remember telling jas i always wanted to go to one... I turned at her to see her already staring at me
Miracle ~~~ Thank you so much Jas
Jas ~~~ No problem ma
Nd with that we started to watch the movie (beyond the lights) we was about 20 minutes into the movie when i looked over to see jas moving her hand towards mine buh she seemed kinda scared so i took it upon myself to grab her hand she looked over at me and smiled
when the movie was over
We pulled up to my house
miracle ~~ Hey jas why don't you stay for a while ya know since it's raining nd all
Jas~~~ Lmao u must be scared of thunder
