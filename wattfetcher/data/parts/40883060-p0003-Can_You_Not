Carson POV
" That surf was great " I say.
" Yass the waves were gnarley " Natie says wit some southern accent.
Right now we were tanning.
All of the sudden I feel wet drops get on me. Wtf
" Hey babe "  who the hell is this and why is he talking to me and my friends.
We look up to find 3 hot guys, who look like they just came up of the ocean.
" Do I know you " Megan says sassy.
" Ooo a feisty one we got here " one of the guys says.
Megan just glares at him.
I have to admit one of the guys was extremely attractive.
