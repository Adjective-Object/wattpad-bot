///Italy's PoV!///
Faintly, I could hear droplets of water pitter-pattering down. I was about to ponder about them, when suddenly, I caught wind of a voice.
"Italy.
... Italy."
It took me a while to process what I heard. "Italy? Italy... Who's that, again? Huh? Me?"
"Are you all right? Are you suffering?" I heard the unknown person ask.
I felt a sense of familiarity upon hearing the voice again. "I... know that voice. Who is it?"
"... You can still go on, right?" I heard the person ask once more, disrupting my thoughts.
It feels like it was slowly dawning me; so much that I was starting to tremble a little. "That voice... I'm sure I...
...!!
W-wait! You're---"
=*=*=*=
"Italy!" I opened my eyes to face sky blue orbs that seemed to shine even in the darkness of the room.

His firm hands held my shoulder, it seems he was the one who shook me awake. "Are you all right? You were having a nightmare." he explained.
I look at him dumbfoundedly. He was calling out to a man named "Italy", right? Could that be...? "...... Me?"
".....Italy? Have you lost your memories again?" he asked me with an expression on his face that was a mix of worry...and fear. By this time, my eyes have already adjusted to the darkness--allowing me to scrutinize fully who this person was: a man with blonde hair and sky blue eyes....with a thick....German...accent.
I see...I remember now....
He raised an eyebrow, noticing my silence. I shook my head and spoke, "... Oh. N-no... I'm... fine, Mr. Germany."
"You..." he managed to say in a low voice. His eyes showed a tinge of sadness...and hurt? What did I do wrong?
I looked away from him and tried to explain. "I'm most defenceless... when I sleep... My memories slowly... slip away. I tried not to fall asleep... I'm sorry."
"No, you have to sleep. It's okay to forget. It can't be good to have only memories of the events in this house..." he told me reassuringly.
Feeling really guilty, I faced him again and tried to talk, "But I--I mean, Mr. Germany--I mean..." I stopped when I finally gathered my self and connected the dots. My memories started to flow back to me. Realising how ridiculous I've been acting, I couldn't help but chuckle a bit.
"Ahaha, what am I saying? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've got it all sorted out now, Germany."
"I-I see..." he stuttered, looking unconcinced.
I decided to sway from the subject and pointed at the bathroom door. "I'll go wash my face. You can go to sleep, Germany....It was your voice that I heard in my dream, wasn't it?"
He raised an eyebrow, but brushed it off as I stood up.
"I don't really get it, but if you're all right, I'm going to sleep. If anything comes up, wake me up." Germany said in a concerned tone.
I smiled at him and saluted. "Veh! Sir, yes sir!"
