I paused for a moment. "I'd want everything to be explained already, too." I sighed. But then, I don't think it'd be okay to just pry and go in there. I guess, I'll have to wait until they're finished. I turned the doorknob and walked into the room where they told me to stay in.


I was alone in silence once more.




Or so I thought.

///Third Person PoV///


Tension rose up quickly inside the Second Players' meeting room. Luciano cursed under his breath. He himself couldn't even believe that he made that big slip-up of telling his allies about something he had hid from them for...such a long, long time already.


But maybe it was time for him to tell them.


It's already too late to take back what he said. Everyone might still find it unbelievable to think about, but they will never let it down until they get a decent and viable explanation on all this.


That's one of the problems, though. How can he explain so much just like that?


How can he explain something so painful in front of everyone?


He can't do that...


He can't show such weakness to the people who show him respect.



All of his comrades started chattering away and questioning so many things that he had no time to compose himself to think about wisely. They all seemed to start becoming consumed by the horrible truth that was told to them in such bad timing.


His brother Flavio was clinging onto Andres desperately looking for reassurance that what I said was not true. The American and Canadian who would usually look like they'd beat the shit out of each other were actually sitting together in silence, without a hint of annoyance with one another. The usually cheery Brit, Oliver, just sat there in a daze, a depressed aura surrounding him. Zao and Nikolai were glaring at him, waiting for him to give them a solid answer. Francois was facing him, his arms crossed. He was waiting for an explanation, as well. As for Lutz and Kuro, they couldn't look at him in the eye at the moment, but they were silent as they always were.
