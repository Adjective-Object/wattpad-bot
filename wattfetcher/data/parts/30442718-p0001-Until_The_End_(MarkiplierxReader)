Your P.O.V
"How about here?" (b/f) asks. "Doesn't look safe. Let's just see if we can find anything useful." I said. "Okaaay." (bff) replied. 'Abandon churches give me the creeps!' I say to myself. (bff) quietly opened the door as I pulled out my shotgun. "I'll go first." (b/f) said. "Okay." Me and (bff) said at the same time. We got in, had to shoot some infected here and there. I sat in the santuary as I reloaded my guns and sharpened some of my knives. "(y/n)? We should find a place to crash. It's starting to get dark." (bff) suggested. "Okay. I'll meet you outside!" I said then smiled. (bff) nodded then (b/f) came and they held hands as they walked out. I sighed, "I need a man." I said outloud as I put my weapons away.
I noticed a picture that fell out of my bag. I picked it up and it was a picture of me and my family. A tear ran down my face. "I never should've left you guys. I'll find you soon... I promise." I said, kissed the picture and put it in my bag. I found some good food in the kitchen then I finally joined (bff) and (b/f). "What's our main objective?" (b/f) asked. "Our main objective is to make it to the treatment place in Winnipeg, Canada. But our current objective is to find somewhere to sleep." I replied. We walked towards downtown. "Hey! Over here!" (bff) yelled. "Shhhhhhh! What if there's infected?!" I whispered/yelled. "Sorry, but look." (bff) said and pointed. It was an apartment! "Let's do it." I said then took out my pistol.
We climbed to the fourth floor and went to the last door on the right. "It's locked." (b/f) said. "Let's shive it!" (bff) said. "you're so smart." (b/f) said to (bff). "Guys not infront of me!" I said then pretended to gag. "Infected." (bff) said. "I got it." I said. "Can I try?" (bff) said. "Fine." I said as I quietly opened the door. (bff) quietly took that infected down. "Good job!" I said then highfived her. We quickly got inside and we boarded up the door. "This is a pent house." (b/f) whispered. "All right we know the drill. Clear any infected out of here. I'll check upstairs." I said then pulled out my pistol.
I crept up the spiral stairs. I checked the first bedroom, it was a recording room? I noticed gaming stuff scattered and alot of drawings of one specific man. He had brown hair, glasses and a M on his shirt. 'He looks fimiliar.' I thought to myself. I checked the bathroom, I saw some medicine... We could use those. I put them in my bag then checked the last two rooms. I guess the last bedroom I entered the master bedroom. I saw a huge mirror. I'm not really a girly girl but I guess I needed to check how I looked.
It was a body mirror so I could see my whole outfit too. I was wearing my older brother's shirt that he ordered from his favorite gamer's online shop. It had a huge red M on it. I think his name was markiplier or something? I was also wearing black skinny jeans and some red converse shoes. Then it hit me. Was this Markiplier's old apartment? "What are you doing here?" Someone asked me. I pulled out my gun, quickly spun around aiming my gun at a tall man who was wearing the same shirt as me!
