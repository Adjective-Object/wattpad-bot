"Oh sorry I thought this was room empty" The girl who stood at the door said.
"No it's okay come in, I could use some company" I laughed.
She walked in and started organizing her photos.
I couldn't really see her face but I could tell she was shorter then me and had brown hair, I think.
"So what photography class are you in?" I asked the stranger.
"Ms Williams class" she answered.
"Hey me too!" I answered
"So what ya working on?" She asked.
"Just my assignment" I answered
"Oh is that the one about freedom?" She asked
"Yeah. So what are you working on?" I asked
"I took some photos over the break so I'm just processing them" She answered
After half an hour of talking with this stranger I felt like I could trust her with anything.
"So I heard you dating Sam" She said quietly
"Yeah what about it?" I asked
"Why? No offense but he is a d*ck" she spoke
"Well yeah he is but if I want to keep up my reputation I have to date a hot guy like him" I admited.
"Well if you didn't have to date him who would you date?" She asked.
"I'm not sure." I answered
"Why do you pretend to be someone your not? You seem really cool but when your with your friends your fake as hell. Why put in all that effort?"
Just as I was about to answer the bell rang and she rushed out.
I walked out and over to my group.
We were said to be the 'flawless' group.
Which isn't true.
All of my 'friends' need a real reality check.
They are fake as f*ck.
"Hey Troy!" Chloe squealed
"Don't call me that." I said
"What are you wearing, like seriously?" Hayley squeaked.
"I'm wearing clothes. You gotta problem?" I sassed
"Babe you look horrible today" Sam said as he looked me up and down.
"What because you can't see half my arse cheek?" I questioned
That talk with photography girl is really changing my tune.
"Well I'd like to see more then that" He winked and moved behind me.
He slid his sleezy arms around my waist and began to kiss my neck.
I pulled away and glared at him.
"Your really going to try to kiss me after what you did to that poor girl this moring?" I asked
"I didn't do anything but expose her for the freak she is" he laughed
"She isn't a freak!" I yelled
"Why are you standing up for little twitchy? Got a crush?" He cooed
"She is a human being and a nice one at that!" I yelled
"Well someone's on their period" he laughed
