Once we got back I held the door open for him and he got on with me following him.
"Vic I'm still really sorry I spilled my coffee on you."
"Kellin if you don't stop apologizing I'm going to break your calculator." I told him, "It's fine okay? Relax."
"You can't break my calculator. I need that." He pouted.
"Then stop apologizing."
"Okay, okay sorry."
"Kellin!"
"Sorry!" He said again.
"That's it, say goodbye to your calculator." I said laughing.
"No! Don't do that!"
"Why shouldn't I? It'll be payback for spilling your coffee all over me." I teased as I started to look around for his calculator.
"Don't! You said it was okay." He whined, "Don't break my calculator I need it for school."
"Well I needed that shirt."
"Well you can wash it." He said.
"Well you can buy a new one."
"Vic Fuentes I swear I will kill you if you break my calculator!" He said just as I found the thing.
"What are you gonna do?"
"I don't know yet but when I figure it out you'll know." He said crossing his arms.
"Well I don't think you need this anyway."
Kellin glared, "Okay I know what I'll do if you break it."
"And what's that."
"When you finally get the guts to ask me out I'll say no." He said smugly.
"I doubt that."
"You wanna test me?"
"I think I might."
"I mean do you really want to risk it. Risk losing all this," He motioned to himself. "Because you want to break a calculator that I need to graduate college so that I don't become a failure in life? Because if so then be my guest, break it."
I sighed and glared at him before laying his dumb calculator down, "You're lucky you're hot."
"I know." He said smiling.
"Whatever." I mumbled, "I'm taking a shower."
"Have fun."
I winked, "Oh I will."
"Ew. Just go shower."
"I'm going, I'm going."  I said walking past him to the bathroom.
"Good you stink anyway."
"Shut up Kellin." I said and walked into the bathroom.  I stripped down before getting into the shower.
Once I got out Kellin was already in bed with his curtain closed so I got in my own bunk quickly.
"Hey Kells."
"Yeah?"
I sighed, it's now or never.
"Will you go out with me?"
