"Kidding." He mumbled before kissing me again.
"Get. A. Room!"
"We have one!" Paul replied.
"Use it."
"No." He kissed me again. I pushed him away, blushing slightly.
"Come on Paul, we're in public."
"Fine." He sighed and grabbed my hand, lacing it with his. He turned back towards Danny.
"Where's Clara?" He asked.
"She went to the bathroom." Danny then turned towards me. "She said she wanted to talk to you about something to do with the wedding."
I nodded. "Okay. I'll go catch up with her later, Daniel."
His nose shriveled up in disgust. "Not you too!"
I laughed. "I just wanted to see how you'd react!"
"Never call me Daniel again."
"Why not?" I fake pouted.
"Only Clara is allowed to call me that."
"How come?"
"She's my wife, that's why."
I stuck my tongue out at him.
Paul laughed, while Danny mimicked my action. Which of course caused me to laugh also.
"Alright, I want some food. Now give me food!" Danny yelled.
"The pizza is over there." Paul pointed to an area across the room.
"You know me so well."
"Of course I do. You don't stop talking about yourself,like ever."
"'Of course I do. You don't stop talking about yourself like, ever. I like to kiss Melanie all the time.'" Danny said in a high pitched voice and then flicked Paul before walking away.
"Real mature, Daniel!"
"Don't call me that, Paulina!"
"Then don't call me Paulina!'
"Fuckin' deal with it!"
"What if i don't want to 'fuckin' deal with it'?"
"Then you're shit out of luck!"
"Jackass." Paul muttered.
"I heard that!" Danny yelled from across the room.
"That's a lie!"
"Alright fine it is, but i know what you said!"
"Paul." I tugged on his sleeve.
He looked down at me confused.
"People are staring." I whispered.
He laughed before pulling me into a hug.
"Get used to staring, Mel. It's going to be happening all your life. Especially when we're friends with the Edge family."
I groaned.
"What you groaning 'bout?"
I turned my head to see Clara, with her hands on her hips, smirking at me.
"So sassy, Clara."
"I think you mean sessy."
"Uh... sure?"
Clara flashed a brilliant smile before pulling me away from Paul. Not that he put up much of a fight.
