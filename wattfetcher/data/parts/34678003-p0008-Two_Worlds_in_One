As I was holding Kaitlyn and looking down at her with a smile on my face, and Chase looked down at both of us with a smile on his face and his right arm was around my waist - Amanda took our picture. She captured the moment of me holding her adorable daughter and Chase looking happily at us. "That's so cute! I love that picture! Mason, come here look at it!" Amanda said to her husband as she showed him her iPhone. "Oh um, ma'am, would you like me to take yor picture?" I asked. Then all of the sudden a Chick - Fil - A worker walked up behind me. "I'll take the picture for you all!" Amanda handed him her iPhone. So, Chase and I stood in the same position and Amanda and her husband, Mason joined us. Then after a few snaps of that picture, I handed Kaitlyn to Chase to hold her. It was the cutest thing.
I had then moved and gotten out of the picture and so it was just the family and Chase, this time I took the picture on Amanda's iPhone - not the Chick - Fil - A guy. After Amanda and Mason broke away from their little group and started walking towards me I managed to get just a picture of Chase and little Kaitlyn. It was the cutest thing. Since we were standing in front of a big window you saw the sunset in the background and it was almost silhouette-like. Chase had his forehead against Kaitlyn's and they were both smiling at eachother. It was the cutest thing I have ever seen - or even taken a picture of.
"Thank you so much for the pictures!" Amanda said to myself and Chase. Chase was still holding Kaitlyn in his arms. This just was the cutest sight - a cute boy holding an adorable baby (well toddler) "It was certainly no problem! And I'm sure Taylor didn't mind!" Chase said with a smile. Amanda and her family left Chick - Fil - A and Chase and I were about to leave.
