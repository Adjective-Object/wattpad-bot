He walked back upstairs, I look at Hayes he sighs walking upstairs. I hear him yelling at Cameron and the the girl. Soon all the girls leave, I continue to watch vampire diaries season three with Riley.
Jake is laid in the middle of the floor sleep, and it's about time for his feeding so I make him a puppy bottle. Hayes is face is boiling red, I stand up and he stops where he is, I hug him tightly, he hugs back and picks me up.
We walk to the couch and I pick up Jake, I grab his bottle and feed it to him, "You must be hungry." I chuckled, I look at the tv my eyes start to water as Caroline cries.
I look at Riley she's already crying, I lay my head on Hayes who's smiling at Riley, Hayes soon looks down and wipes my tears away. I smile and kiss him, Jake starts to whine and I take him to the bathroom. We go back inside and I pull out his little bed, he stays in there for a while and gets out scratching my legs.
I pick him up and he sleeps on my lap, "You are so spoiled." I chuckled, Hayes smiles wrapping his arms around me I feel a hand rub on my thigh. "Hayes stop." I whisper holding onto his hand.
Tanner gets up cutting off the lights and Hayes looks at me, "I love you." Hayes said, "I love you too." I said, I soon fall asleep on his chest hearing his heartbeat.
