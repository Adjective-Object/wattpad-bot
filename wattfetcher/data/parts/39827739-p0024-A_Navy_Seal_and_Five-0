"Whose Thanatos?" Danny asked.
"The Greek god of death. From what I could gather I think our murderer is a high priest of Thanatos. There is a group of Greek pagans here on the island. I'm sending you the address now" I said typing in the address and sending it to Uncle Steve.
"Okay, anything else?" Uncle Steve said.
"One more thing. I found that your killer is going to kill again, tonight. He killed his other four victims on full moons and tonight is a super moon, which means the moon will be larger than other nights" I said.
"Good job Kylie, call us if you get anything new" Danny said and they hung up. I went back to trying to find out where the next murder would be. I didn't realize how long I was working on the research till I heard a voice behind me.
"I can come back later if you're busy" Colin said.
"No, no it's okay. I'm just working on a case" I told him.
"Having trouble?" he asked me.
"Little bit. Where's the best place to watch the moon rise?" I asked.
"Um.. up on the cliffs near Diamond Head. Why?"
"Oh it's just cuz I think our murderer in this case is going to strike again. I just can't figure out who his next target is" I said pulling up the pictures of the four victims.
"Hey have you noticed that they all have different jobs that were important in ancient Greece?" Colin asked me.
"What?" I asked confused.
"Yeah, look he's a philosophy teacher, he's an up and coming politician, she's a writer and she was a doctor, the only other job that would come to mind for ancient Greece would be a soldier. Like a Spartan" Colin said and that's when it hit me.
"Oh my God!" I said and grabbed my gun, just as Kono and Chin walked in.
"Kylie what's wrong? What did I say?" Colin asked.
"Guys where's Steve and Danny?" I asked.
"They're at the place where killer is supposed to be, why?" Chin asked.
"I know who the target is. It's Steve" I said and we all rushed out of the office.
