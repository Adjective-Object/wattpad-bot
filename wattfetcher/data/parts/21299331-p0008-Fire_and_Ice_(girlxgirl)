"Here, Sky, put these over your wet cloths to keep the wind off" I say handing her the change, she quickly puts the hoodies over her singlet and the track pants over her shorts. Perfect. I put mine on too, as soon as I'm finished with the change I set up a rug on the grass.
"Hey, Sky, come sit" I say sitting on the rug and getting comfortable.
"I'm coming Bell, hang on" Sky replies coming over and getting comfortable next to me, sky being the bigger one let's me lye on her chest, she wraps her strong arms around me to keep me warm. If this isn't love, I don't know what is. Just us, under the stars, counting the constellations and finding out new things about each others day, it's simply perfect.
If we didn't have school tomorrow I would fall asleep right now, right in my girls arms, safe from the world when we are together. We know where better together, everyone knows that, even my parents sorta understand. Sky's parents don't know yet. I can't wait for tomorrow, it will be a special day.
