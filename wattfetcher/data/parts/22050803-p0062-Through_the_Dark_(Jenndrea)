Answer this question: if you could have me write one thing, whether that be in this story or just in general, what would it be? (Tbh this is just how i try to keep things going)

Nice, nice! cute v cute. jenndrea might be done for irl but that doesn't mean we have to stop ya know? Anyway, I hope y'all are doin well.
Sorry for the basically monthly updates, I just want people to read the BEST things i can do, not just sloppy, rushed things that i put out to please people. Thank you all for always being patient.
If you have any recommendations for this story/things you want me to write for this story, please say so! :) I'm literally uncreative haha keep this story alive pleeease.
