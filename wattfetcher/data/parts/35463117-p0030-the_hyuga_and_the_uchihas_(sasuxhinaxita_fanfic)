Sasuke was hesitant but spoke, "my father told me I can't be around you. My brother has notice I've been sneaking away, I can't see you anymore. I am sorry my kitsune. I can't be with you any longer. I'm sorry." And with these painful words in an already rainy day sasuke left, leaving naruto, in tears, weeping like a lost infant. Only not even the kindest of souls would help him.
End of sad flashback:'(
And here he was again. Broken. In tears. Bruised. Bleeding...but worst of all. Naruto was crying because he lost him. He lost the raven that broke his heart. But he loved that raven too much to hate him. He wanted to feel his touch, his kiss, he wanted to feel a filling warmth in his shattered heart. To replace the cold and empty void that is dark, a menacing voice echoeing in narutos mind.
"Foolish boy. You could have killed him. You could have used my power. Show him what your true power is!" The evil fox spirit seal in naruto said.
No! Naruto said mentally to the spirit. I love him I'll not hurt him! I'll only hurt myself if I do!
"Foolish. You are a foolish boy!" The nine tails bellowed.
So what! It doesn't matter if he hates me! I'll always love him! Naruto screamed wishing he could believe his own words. Just go away you fox!
"I'm sealed inside you, I'm not leaving anytime soon you fool!" The nine tails growled. "Your too much of a fool to even protect yourself!"
