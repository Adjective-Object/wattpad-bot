Jordan's POV
"Oh Jordan?" she said in a Seducing tone.
"heh?" he responded.
I stayed the night at his house, why I do not know.
I walked into his room with a smile as big as ever.
"What's with your face?"
"My smile? I'm just happy to be here."
"that and your not wearing makeup, I like you without makeup."
"Eww, no i'm disgusting."
"Although you look good all the time. whats up?"
"Come on."
"What are we doing Er-"
"Woah." I said as I entered my living room to see a set up of food and a nice place to sit on my couch with a blanket set up.
"Did you do this?" we both said at the same time
"yes, I knew you were going to say that." she said with the biggest smile on her face that i've seen so far this year.
"I can't believe you Erin."
"Jordan?"
"What?" I said as I leaned in to kiss her. she leaned away, why did I lean in and why did she lean away?
"Sorry... I." She said
"What? no i'm sorry I don't know why I... I didn't do that okay?" I said hoping she would get over it and not be mad.
"So? ehh? ehh?" she said
"I love it Erin." I said
