After lunch, Alex and I went to algebra class. While we were walking to our class, all people were talking about was Shawn and Lily. And when they remembered that I had set them up, people wanted me to help them hook up with their crushes. I guess I'm just that amazing.
When Alex and I got in our class, we sat down at our regular seats: I was seated behind Alex. Clearly, my algebra teacher wasn't smart when he put me behind a genius in school.
"Good afternoon, class." Mr. Joe said once everyone was in class and settled down. "Today, we will be having a pop quiz about what we've learned in chapter 7."
Everyone in the room let out a huge groan of boredom. Pop quizzed in Mr. Joe's class were so difficult. Whenever I took his quizzes, I would always get C's or D's.
Mr. Joe passed out the quizzes. "This is due by the end of the period. You may start now." Everyone started to answer the questions on the quiz while I was daydreaming about how I'm going to fail this quiz. I decided to actually try to answer some questions. When I looked at my paper, I knew I was screwed. I turned over the paper to found even more questions there. I am going to fail, I thought. Luckily, sitting behind Alex gave me a window of opportunities.
"Alex." I whispered.
Alex turned around and looked at me. "What?"
"I need help." I said.
"Sorry, Can't help." She responded.
"Fine. Can you at least give me the answers?" I asked.
"No!" Alex half whispered, half screamed. She turned around and went back to working on her paper.
I decided to guess on all the questions. Right when I was guessing on the 3rd question, I saw Alex get up and turn in her quiz. When she came to her seat, other students were getting up and turning in their quiz, I was panicking because there were 30 fucking questions on the fucking quiz
"Fuck." I cursed under my breath. "Alex. You have to help me on this." I pleaded. Alex turned around and started to glare at me. I returned the same glare. She softened hers, so I softened mine.
"Sorry." Was all she said before turning back around.
"Come on. Help a bro out." I begged. That's when I found Mr. Joe standing beside my desk, glaring down at me.
"Ms. Red. Can you tell me why I am standing here, right next to you?" Mr. Joe asked.
"Yes, I can." I replied. There was an awkward silence between us and to make it more uncomfortable, the whole class started to stare at us. "Oh. You want an explanation. Ok. You were bored and you needed someone to talk to." The class started laughing.
"No, Ms. Red. You were trying to cheat on your test." Mr. Joe told me.
"No. You're wrong. I was just simply asking a classmate questions about the quiz. There's a huge difference, Mr. Joe." I corrected.
"Charlotte. I am giving you an F on this quiz." Mr. Joe said as he took my paper and ripped it into shreds. Then he went back to his desk to throw it away.
"Thank you, Mr. Joe, for failing me on this quiz. Now, I don't have to know this. It's even worthless in my future." I shouted. Mr. Joe turned around, glared at me once more, and crossed his arms.
"You're going to end up in jail." Mr. Joe responded.
"Thanks for believing in me." I yelled. The bell rang and everyone was escaping the classroom.
As I was about to leave, Mr. Joe said, "You're impossible to deal with."
