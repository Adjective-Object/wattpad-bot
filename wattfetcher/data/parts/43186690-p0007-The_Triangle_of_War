"I love you Chaz, I have always loved you. From the sart all I have ever wanted was to be with you. I know that maybe it seems like a little girl crush when we were youngerr. But no, it isnt a stupid little girl crush. I am in love with you, and I want you. I.... I want you to make love to me Chaz. Before you are gone I want to be with you, I want to know that when you come home you will want me with you, forever. I want to be yours, and you to be mine, Chaz. That is all I have ever wanted."
That night we made love multiple times. I fell asleep next to him talking about how life would be like when he comes back. I dont know when i fell asleep, but when i woke up I had the biggest smile on my face. that is until I noticed the note laying next to my head. 'I love you too, Allycat. I'm sorry.'
I take a deep breath as the memories fade into nothing. I havnt thought about that night for six years, that was the last time I saw him until now. Three weeks later I found out I was pregnant. All the pain I was in after losing our child hit me like a frieght train at full speed. Steadying my breathing I look up at him as say "I'm engaged."
