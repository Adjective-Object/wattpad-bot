Germany looked at his older brother with a pained expression. "Prussia!! Why?!"
"Hey, West! Is this really the time to wipe the floor?!" Prussia joked with a sort of bittersweet chuckle.
Italy went over to his friend. "... I'm sorry. Are you okay, Germany?"
"Italy..." Germany looked up to his Italian friend.
(Ahh, I see. My mistake was to try to solve everything on my own.)
(And the reason why we kept being defeated was my narrow-mindedness. I didn't observe anyone but the enemy.)
I quickly rushed over to the others.
"This is my answer! The enemy is stronger, but so are we. If we all join forces, we can defeat it!" I exclaimed, drawing my sword.
Prussia smirked. "Heh. Well done!"
"You idiots!! Why did you come back?!" Germany asked with a sullen expression. It seems he didn't want us to get hurt along with him.
"You want to know why I came back?" Prussia said whilst holding his arms up to somehow cover Germany from the monster.
Germany's light blue eyes widened when Prussia continued,
"Because...
I can't think of a reason why I wouldn't help my little brother!"
