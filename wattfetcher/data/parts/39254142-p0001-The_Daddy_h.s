My eyes slowly fluttered open taking in the unfamiliar surroundings noticing that I was not in the comfort of my own bedroom. I slowly felt a strong tattooed arm slither around my waist pulling me in closer so that I could hear their heart beat.
Cautiously, I pulled the arm away from me noticing that I was fully exposed. I started scrambling for my clothes, still trying to keep quiet not wanting to wake up the beautiful stranger. "Get back to bed, baby girl" a deep raspy voice echoed throughout the Room.
Hearing that voice brought back so many memories of the night I had just endured. I had snuck into a night club with fake IDs saying we were 21 when in reality I was 17. I was dancing just having a good time when I felt a hard bulge grind against my back. I felt so grown up to think I had actually been mistaken for a 21 year old that I agreed to go back to the strangers house.
When we arrived i was slammed up against a hard wall, leaving bruises on my back, his plump pink lips leaving warm sloppy kisses across my jaw line and neck. "Do you want Daddy to make you feel good?" The fact he hade referred to him self as daddy turned me on even more. "Do you want Daddy to make you feel better than you've ever felt before?" He mumbled into my neck sucking harshly at my skin holding my legs around his waist grinding into me slowly. "Well baby girl do you?"As much as I regret it, i let out a loud moan "yes" and that's all I could remember from the night before.
I shed a small tear as the fact I may have lost my virginity to some random stranger in a dodgy night club. I wanted to curl up in a ball I feel so dirty looking at the the red sore marks left on my neck.
I felt obliged to throw my self into the strangers bed, but I couldn't bring myself too just casually jump into a randomers bed. "If you don't get back into bed right now, I swear daddy will spank your pretty little bottom so hard you won't walk for days" the voice sounded angrier but a hint of lust hid behind the anger.
By this time I was fully dressed and ready to leave I just had to locate my shoes and then I could happily leave. I peered over at the bed only to see a long mop of dark brown hair messily spread across the pillow. Then suddenly a piercing emerald faze burned into my small form. "Did you not hear me?! Get back in bed now!" The lust had completely disappeared by now and only a forceful groan was left. But me being as pathetic as I am I cried and ran for the door without my shoes.
I heard loud footsteps quickly gaining on me as I ran across the mysterious flat. The hallways never seemed to end rooms upon rooms. The footsteps coming closer and closer. "You're going to get it when I find you!" The voice was deep and slow almost sung in a mocking tune.
I spotted the door out of the comer of my eye and in a flash I was fumbling with the locks turning around to see a fully naked tattooed man in the hall way. I finally opened the door and got slammed the doored sliding down out of breath as I sat on the floor."Fine run but baby girl, I'm Harry styles, and I always get what I want!"
