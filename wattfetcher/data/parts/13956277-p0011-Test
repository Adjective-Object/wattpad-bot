"Welcome, food is on the table" Damon said
"I'll pray Duhr prayer first" I went to my room and washed my face.
I felt guilty for being away from the Holy Qur'aan for a while, maybe that's why I feel empty .
I read 10 pages after I prayed then went down.
Me and Elina sat and started eating, Damon came and sat beside me, I moved away from him but he kept coming closer,
"You know these sticky people who keep annoying you even after you scold them and push them away ?" I asked after I swallowed.
"Oh yeah, So annoying" Elina chuckled, Damon realized that I meant him and moved away
"AlHamdu-lellah, now excuse me I need to study, Thanks for the food Mrs.Carter" I gave her a warm smile then headed to my room ...
5 minutes later .
knock knock
-"who is it"
-"Damon"
-"what do you want"
-"Can I ask you something"
-"NO"
-"I'm serious"
-"yeah me too Damon"
-"just open the damn door"
-"just go away I've had enough action today"
-"Is that what I get for being nice?"
-"No, That's what you get for flirting with me and winking at me, Now go away because im trying to be as nice and calm as possible"
-"Uh I just wanted to help you with the school things since we are in the same classes"
-"No thank you"
-"Don't you wan-
-"NO"
He left after we argued for almost half an hour.
I finished studying then went down.
"I'm gonna get some Ice-cream , anyone wants some?" I asked
"Wait a second Leena, I told Damon to Get the grocery, Go together" Mrs.Carter said
"No I'm fine alone" I rejected
"You wont be alone with him in the car, you'll go on your feet, plus, you dont know the area yet" She explained
"Okay Okay" I agreed, a cheeky smile was drawn on Damon's face when he followed me out .
"I know you rejected Jake for me" he started to tease me
"Now believe me, If they made me choose between you and Jake, I'd prefer going to hell instead of going out with any of you" I mocked
he remained quiet the whole way until we reached the market .
I pulled some ice-cream sticks and went to pay for them.
"What are you doing" Damon asked
"Making a magical potion that will make you disappear" I rolled my eyes "I'm paying for the icecream"
"You know that I'm standing right here, so put your money back" he commanded
"What's wrong with you, Your body temperature must be high"
"since I'm the man, I'm gonna pay" he answered
