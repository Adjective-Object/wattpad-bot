I usually am okay when writing books. (Pobably shouldn't admit that but YOLO)
I almost always end up ending a sentence randomly. Go ahead. Ask my friends. (WHO I HAVE YET TO FOLLOW THEMxD) If you both are reading this...you didn't read the above sentence.
So yeah, back to the main purpose of this random book, this is supposed to be random... (Stop going for the obvious!)
ENJOY!
