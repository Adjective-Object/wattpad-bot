I: Ant, you do know that the walls are thin right?
I: Did you get louder on purpose? >.>
I: Anthony, I just got a call from our neighbors, now is the time to stop.
I: It's been 6 hours. I know you're faking now.
I: I know you're reading my messages you perv. >.>
A: I wasn't faking. I had a ring on.
I: Where did you get the ring?
A: Remember my engagement ring?
I: Yeah....
I: Oh my god, seriously?
A: Yeeepppp
I: Kalel would be soooo pissed...
A: If you tell her, no cuddles, kisses, or 'fun'.
I: Fine.
A: Love youuuuu!!!
I: I love you too, you pervy weirdo.
A: Did the neighbors really call you?
I: Sadly, yes.
A: Well I can never face them again.
I: Don't worry. I told them Pip was attacking you and they bought it.
A: But still. I need to take this ring off.
A: Shit
I: What?
A: It's stuck.
I: Really?
A: Please help...
I: I'll be there in a second.
A: Yey
I: You liar.
I: It was not stuck.
I: You're just not strong enough to pull it off.
A: Shut up.
