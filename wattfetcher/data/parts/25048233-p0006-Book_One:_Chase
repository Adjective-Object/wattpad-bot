“…” I cringed at the word “love”. It made me remember everything all over again.
“Chase…”
“What? Just freaking say it!”
“I love you.”
“Ching… Ching… Ching, are you alright?”
“Oh, yeah I’m fine Ma!” My mind seemed to have drifted somewhere.
“You seem… troubled. Do you want to talk about it?”
“Uhm, no. I mean, I don’t have anything going on Ma! Let’s just enjoy breakfast! I’m really hungry. Mmm… so good!” I managed to ramble enough words just to dodge the question.

“If you say so. Just take it easy, huh.”

As usual, a lot of girls were already gathered around Archcross High’s main gate. This time however, I’m not so enthusiastic in meeting them. I’m not in the mood in dealing with this. To be honest, I’m kinda’ annoyed with all the screaming and squealing. I decided to walk past through everyone, making sure to not give eye contact to any one of them.
“Hey Chase!” Oh god, not this girl again. I turned around to see Pearl waving at me.
“What do you want? I’m not in the mood. Please go away.” I might punch you in the face because I feel like doing it right now.
“Are you up for an interview?”
“No.” I continued walking towards our classroom. I can’t deal with any of these things right now. Not with anyone, especially Pearl.
“Don’t worry! It’s just gonna’ take a little of your time. Don’t worry; I made sure to confirm everything first before approaching you. I mean, I’m not mistaking you for Ice anymore.” I stopped to face her once more. Why’d you have to mention Ice’s name, out of all people?
“Do you wanna’ get a bruise or something? You’re really annoying the hell out of me. I’m not in the mood.” I continued walking again – this time, increasing speed.
“WHY ARE YOU SO STINGY? YOU GOT DUMPED OR SOMETHING?” Everyone in the hallway heard what she said. She shouted so loud that everyone turned to face her, then me. The fuck is this girl talking about – embarrassing me in front of everyone.
“…” I’m speechless. I can’t believe this girl.
“So it’s true then? Heh.” Pearl let out an audible chuckle. You can really see how she is enjoying the attention being given to her, now that she has “supposedly revealed” something bad about me.
“Whatever Psycho. Mind your own fucking business!” I can’t help myself anymore. This has been stressing me out more than I expected it to be.
“Okay, okay. I’ll leave you alone – for now. Just remember that you’re on my radar now. Heh.” With that, she went away.

I can now hear several whispers about me. It’s as if they cannot believe that I have been “dumped” by someone. They know that no one would dare to reject a guy like me. I don’t care. It’s been made-up anyways. They can think whatever they want. Sigh.

The morning classes went by unnoticed as I wasn’t really paying attention to them. My friends asked me if I wanted to eat lunch with them but I politely declined. I will just feel bad for them if I ruin lunch with the problems I am having. I made up my mind and decided to spend my lunch time alone. At least I’ll get to breathe and relax from all the stresses I’ve had this morning.
