I know that the plane ride to La Push is going to be very long and very boring. I know that it's a good idea to go but I really don't want to leave all of my friends here in Phoenix. I have to though, not only because mom and Phil need alone time, but because I have to keep an eye on my twin sister Bella. She is really clumsy, and going to a very wet, and rainy place, it will only get worse. It's not that I don't love my sister, because I do, it's just that I would like to have a break from the watching duty.
"Drew! Come on or else you are going to miss your plane!" Mom yells from downstairs. I look around my bare room one last time and grab my suit case and backpack off my bed. Mom assured me that dad got me a bed already so I don't have to worry about sending that, I also have a dresser and desk there, so I only had to send the rest of my things. They should be there by now, I have a hammock and hopefully I will be able to set it up in my room, just like I did here.
I walk down the stairs and see my friend Damion, he is like a brother to me. I know everything about him and his family, including him being a vampire. He is a good one though, he doesn't feed on humans, only on animals. Don't ask how I found out, it's not a pretty story. Anyway, before he was hanging out with this girl named Alice, they got split up and he was left hear broken. According to him, they were mares. That story always makes me sad, he told me about her special ability to see the future. "What are you doing here Damion?"
"I can't say goodbye to my sister?" He asks, pretending to be hurt.
"If you really want to, make sure that you visit though."
"Of course I will visit, if there aren't more of me there, it would not be good to have a new comer on their territory." He whispers the last part quietly, making sure not to let the others hear him.
"Lizzy, come on! I want a hug before you leave!" Phil whines. He is like a brother to me also, even though he is my step dad. We bonded really quickly. I smile and hug him tightly. "I'm going to miss you Lizzy!"
"I'm gonna miss you too!" He sets me back down and we head out to the car. I place my bags in the trunk and slide into the back seat next to Bella. We are complete opposites, she hates the rain, but I love it. I hate the sun, and she prefers it. She is clumsy and doesn't do well in sports, while I am the athletic one.
"Make sure you email often, text whenever you get the chance, oh, and make sure to win them some trophies!" Mom says excitedly. I don't think she ever found a way to calm down when she was my age. I got my bubbly spirit from her. Bella got her social awkwardness from dad. I, unlike my mother, found a way to stay calm, I play many sports. I love to run! I wont be able to run as much there until I get used to running in the rain though.
"Okay, I love you all, but we got a plane to catch." Phil says as we say our last goodbye's in front of the air port. I give Mom and Phil one last goodbye before heading to the desk and handing her my ticket. I made sure to wear something comfortable for the plane ride.
After we are in the air I take out my phone and listen to some music, hopefully it will get my mind off my first day of school tomorrow. Dad enrolled us in school already because he thought that it would be better for us to start off right away. Luckily tomorrow is Monday so we have to go through the entire week. Note the sarcasm.
The music didn't help my mind drift away though, all that I would think about was school. Don't get me wrong, I love school, I'm a high honer, straight A student, I just wanted more than a few hours to get settled in before school starts. Maybe I can convince dad to let me stay home tomorrow so I can get fully settled in. Yeah, that will happen with pigs fly. It wont hurt to ask. Then again, if I am able to stay home, then Bella would be left alone on her first day of school. What kind of sister would I be if I allowed that to happen?
