You were laying on the couch taking a naplike you did everyday. Dan and Phil were at the radio station doing their show. You were about 45 minutes into your hour long nap when you heard the front door open followed by Dan yelling, "Honey I'm home!" Then Phil says very faintly, "I'm here too..." You groggily get up and walk over to Dan giving him a small sweet kiss. Then you gave Phil a longing hug, not wanting him to feel left out. You then trudged back to the couch trying to continue your nap, but according to Dan and Phil that was not going to happen. They decided to film a video for DANANDPHILGAMES. You really didn't care if you were in the background and neither did the guys. They were going to do a Dan vs. Phil, the game being Just Dance 4. You loved this game and usually forced Dan to play with you. They asked for any suggestions, to which you responded " The Beauty And The Beat/ Call Me Maybe mashup one and Livin' La Vida Loca." "UGHHH!" They both roaned. They knew they were both relatively hard. "Your fault for asking me." You responded. After the video was over Dan had won.(Which you thought would happen anyway.) Dan came up to you and layed down with you. "Thanks for the suggestions Babe." "No problem Danny." You replied giving him a light kiss. Moments later Dan had fallen asleep on you so, you just grabbed the remote and watched TV.
Authors Note:This is my first Imagine and it probably sucks... I wrote the first couple of Imagines when I was at Church Camp so a lot will be themed after that... that's it... BYE!
