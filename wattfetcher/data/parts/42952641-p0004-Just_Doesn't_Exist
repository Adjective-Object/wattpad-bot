//Nicole's Point of View//
"Heather, Heather, and Heatheeeeerrrr..." I sang, driving near the park by my apartment. I was jamming out to the Heathers the Musical soundtrack. I was on the first track of course, it was one of my favorites at the moment. The night was perfect; I couldn't stop thinking about it! I saw Heathers again and met Ryan McCartan! And he took interest in me!? This had to be a dream. A dream too perfect. I was so happy, I knew nothing could ruin this night!
"And then there's the Heathers, they float above it all..." I quoted along with Veronica on the track. "Heather McNamara, head cheerleader. Her dad is loaded; he sells engagement rings... Heather Duke, runs yearbook. No discernable personality, but her mom did pay for implants... And Heather Chandler... The almighty..."
A large tree branch fell from a tree from the park, right in front of my car. I screamed, hitting the brakes and turning my wheel rapidly, hitting a light post. The last thing I heard before my mind went blank was Veronica finishing Heather Chandler's introduction.
"... She is a mythic bitch."
