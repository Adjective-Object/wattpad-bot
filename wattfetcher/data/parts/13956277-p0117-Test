We got back to the mansion, "How am I supposed to get in my room?", "Climb up, the way I doo", "What if I fall?", "I'll catch you", "Fine" I climbed the huge tree that was planned in the garden and extended to reach the roof, "Too bad you're wearing jeans, can't see a thing, why didn't you get into a skirt this time" I was still climbing the tree, I chuckled, "Shut up, you are so rude, I took off a shoe and threw it at him" , "You missed me" Simon said as he was laughing,  I slowly took the second shoe off and aimed it on his head, "Ouch" He frowned, "Didn't miss it this time" I chuckled and reached my window, "Goodnight Leena", "Goodnight". I felt something strange, something I haven't felt for so long, I got the feeling that I had when my parents were here. Love ? Maybe
....
"I want to go to the park" I said, "Are you serious?" Karam asked, "Life goes on, right Simon?" Simon was watching TV and he nodded, "Fine" Karam agreed. I opened my closet, got into skinny pants along with a long T-shirt and walked to the living room, "Are you going out like this ?" Simon asked, "Yes, why?" I asked, "You always wear large things,  those are skinny jeans, way too skinny", "Come on, I like it, doesn't it look good?", "Yes it does but it shows your figure, and let me be honest,  it's not a bad view", "Whatever, I'm going to wear whatever I want" .
Me and Simon were laughing then we noticed that Karam wasn't with us, I turned around and saw him leaning sitting on a bench with his phone on his ear, "He's talking to his girlfriend" I chuckled, "How did you know?" I raised an eyebrow,  "Look, he's blushing, smiling lightly and whispering, I bet he just told her that he loves her", "Don't be ridiculous", "It's a bet then", "Fine, Simon" We walked toward Karam and he got nervous when we got closer, Simon ran toward Karam and snapped the phone from his hand, "IT LOVE YOU, YOU ARE SO HOT" Simon said to the person Karam was talking to, Karam started chasing Simon ad he kept saying stupid things on the phone. "TOLD YOU, IT'S A GIRL" Simon shouted as he was running away with Karam's phone, "Give it to me before I break your head off" Karam threatened. Simon gave the phone back but got a playful punch though.
"Who is she ?" I asked, "What she ?" Karam acted foolish,  "Don't you lie, it's a she, a beautiful she, I saw the background" Simom wiggled his eyebrows and Karam blushed. "OH shame on you ! Since when?" I gasped, "Don't get me wrong, I want her as a wife, but her father rejected me many times", "Do I know her ?"I asked curiously,  "Remember the girl next door in our old house, Yara?" I gasped,  "You've got to be kidding me, she's ugly" I said, "No she's not, she's beautiful, I don't only care about the looks" I felt bad for calling her ugly,  I've never called somebody ugly, because they don't decide the shape of their body , the colour of their eyes, the size of their nose of their length. "And why did he reject you?" Simon asked sadly, "He said that we live in two different worlds, I'm living with my rich brother and they're still poor" Karam explained,  "That's stupid" Simon said, "Didn't we come here to play and have fun? Why are we still sitting here?".
My phone rang, "What do you want Simon?" I answered, "Sneak out, let's go to our secret place", "What secret place?" I asked half asleep, "Starbucks you stupid pumpkin", "Bye", "No, I'm serious", "It's 10 pm", "Yeah I know, this is gonna be our secret place at this secret time", "I really hate you", "Just get up and get dressed" . I got into skinny jeans, but with kind of a tight shirt this time, I looked good, my body looked perfect in that outfit.
"Ready to go? "I asked as he hopped in my car, "What is this?" Simon asked, "What?" , "Your outfit" Simon frowned, "What's wrong with it?" I raised an eyebrow, "Tight and shows much", "What's wrong with you and my look?", "What's wrong with YOU? You're not used to dress like this" He said, "Life goes on, we change" I smiled and turned my car on, Simon wasn't completely comfortable.
