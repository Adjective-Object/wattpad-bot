Hi my name is (what?) my name is (who?) My name is chicka chicka Rose. I'm from Detroit. The other side of Detroit. Let me tell you, Detroit is not very forgiving. I'm 17 and working part time waitress and part time student. I have to provide for myself and my family. My dad is a alcoholic, my mother is never around she always too busy do something, and my sister is in a bad spot in her life right now. My only escape from this tiny trailer park and abusive family is music. Especially Eminem. The world is so much better and quieter when your blasting Eminem in your ears. I'm huddled up in my room trying to do my homework, when my phone beeps letting me know it's dying. I search the dark room for the charger when all of a sudden I hit something hard. I look up to my dad hovering over me. He picks me up by my hoodie. "What the fuck are you doing you little shit?" He snarled at me. "Beer and weed, you've been having fun" I mumbled to myself. "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!" Oh shit I didn't know he heard me. He threw me and the floor and started kicking and punching me. I learned not to fight back because if I did it would only be worse. He was fighting for breath and he finally stopped. I was curled up in a fetus position aching. I fought myself to get up and go make sure there's no bad bruises. I looked in the bathroom mirror there were some starting to come up on my stomach and side. I made my way to the den and grabbed my charger. I fell asleep when my head hit the pillow. *5 years later* I'm 22 and out of that house! I'm engaged to my high school sweetheart! I've got a good job! Everything is perfect! *Flash back to the present* I was so dumb to think that he was the one. I was so dumb to stay in that house for so long and get beat everyday. I still have scars and bruises. Whatever. I don't care. I'm not going to let my past determine my future, I'm not gonna let it determine who I am & who I'm gonna be!
