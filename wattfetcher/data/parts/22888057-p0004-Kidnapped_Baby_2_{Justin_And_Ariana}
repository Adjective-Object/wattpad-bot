"Now what do we say?"He asks.
"Our love memo"Isabelle answers.
"I love you to the moon and back"Me and Justin begin.
"To infinity and beyond"Sophia and Isabelle say next.
"For ever and ever"We all say together.
"Good night"I say and we both kiss their for heads.
Before we walk out, I hear Sophia's voice again.
"Thank you for the best birthday ever"She says.
"Your welcome"We both say. We turn the light off and close the door.
We head to our room and get in bed ourselves.
"Our little girls are growing up"Justin says as I lay down and face him.
"I know, too fast. You know what Jayden told Tracy? He said that he loves Sophia and that she's pretty"I tell him.
"Well he can't have her, she's all mine"He smiles.
"She can't be yours forever, soon someone will take her and have her for himself just like you did to me"I say.
"Still, she will not be dating any boys when she gets older"He says and I laugh at him.
"Go to sleep Justin"I laugh and close my eyes and drift to sleep.
