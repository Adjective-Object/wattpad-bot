(I know it sounds cheesy putting a Katy Perry song in here but I promise it's a great song that totally belongs here)
"I leave the gas onWalk the allies in the darkSleep with candles burningI leave the door unlockedI'm weaving a rope andRunning all the red lightsDid I get your attention?Cause I'm sending all the signs that
The clock is tickingAnd I'll be giving my 2 weeksPick your favorite shade of blackYou'd best prepare a speechSay something funnySay something sweetBut don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathingBut we've been dead for awhileThis sickness has no cureWe're going down for sureAlready lost our gripBest abandon ship, oh
Maybe I was too paleMaybe I was too fatMaybe you had betterBetter luck in the sackNo formal educationI swore way too muchBut I swear you didn't care'Cause we were in love
So as I write this letterAnd shed my last tearKnow it's all for the betterThat we end this hereLet's close this chapterSay one last prayerBut don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathingBut we've been dead for awhileThis sickness has no cureWe're going down for sureOh, we've been diagnosedSo let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathingBut we've been dead for awhileThis sickness has no cureWe're going down for sureAlready lost our gripBest abandon ship, oh."
