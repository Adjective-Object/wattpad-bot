NOOOOO! NOT OCTY! She is my third favorite background character, so I am really upset to see her go. But I guess I is time to let her go. Well as always, if you voted her out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
VINYL
DERPY
LYRA
Good luck to the nominees! (I didn't give a description of them because, that's what the fandom thinks of them)
