THIS PLACE IS AWESOME ! IT HAS EVERYTHING I NEED.
"Elina isn't a baby, she's free to do whatever she wants" He said, I raised an eyebrow at him and gave him 3 skirts, 4 blouses, 6 jackets and 8 hijaabs to hold.
"So that's the only point you disagree with in the definition of MAN" I rolled my eyes and turned around
"why are you silent" I asked
"ma-hbe ba-cose 'am hold'n 200 pieces of clothes that c'vred ma whole face an' mo'th" he said through the clothes and I laughed
"I'll go get a basket *pause*, you know what, I don't think your muscles are for nothing, so hold yourself and hold these clothes" I put more and more things over the mountain of clothes he held with his bare hands.
I kept walking and choosing clothes, Until I reached the shoes & heels section. I froze.
"Oh my god ugghhhh" he sighed in frustration when he saw the colorful shelves that had colorful shoes and heels over them, because he knew that he still got way more things to carry.
"I swear if you bring any-" he was cut off by me putting two boxes in front of him
"No talk, more work. You wanted to have some time with me, now you must handle the consequences" I pulled more and more things.
"Didn't you bring any clothes from your house" he said sarcastically.
"No" I raised my eyebrows and answered sarcastically.
"That's funny" He laughed.
"What" I raised an eyebrow.
"Counting how many times you raise your eyebrow, I reached 63" He continued laughing
"What a huge baby I'm speaking to !" I sighed
"So you don't think I'm a man ha?" He asked
"I think you already know my answer" I raised an eyebrow
"64 ... Take that jacket, It will bring out your eyes *pause* you know, I'm still young to work"
me: Is he still thinking about what I've said minutes ago ?
mind: Your harsh words affected him for sure.
"But you're not young to drink, party, Date and spend your father's money on stupid stuff yeah?"
"I'm tired. Let's go home" He sighed
"No you're not, You just don't want to face the truth. See, the problem is that most of the guys around your age think that acting like jerks or bad boys is what makes them attractive men. You think that breaking a girl's heart, Drinking, smoking and doing other stupid things prove that you're the One. The powerful One, The best One, The Hottest One. When you actually are : The stupidest One, The most pathetic One, The saddest One for wasting the best part of your life doing stupid things you'll regret when you get older and wish you haven't done"
