There is one person I hate in this world above all others. Only one person in this world I hate enough to kill. I hate this person so much it consumes my soul. Every time they get happy I tear them down. Every time they rise up I push them to the ground where they belong. Anytime some is nice to them I convince them that they don't care at all so they end up all alone. I am both mentally and physically abusive to them. I cut them with a blade. Burn their skin. Make them fall down the stairs. Point out every flaw. Make them feel so terrible about themselves that they cry themselves to sleep every night. No one could possibly hate them more than I do. They fuck everything up. But don't feel bad--they deserve everything they get.
Now, who, you may be asking, am I talking about? Who could I possibly hate this much? The answer is simple.
Me.
