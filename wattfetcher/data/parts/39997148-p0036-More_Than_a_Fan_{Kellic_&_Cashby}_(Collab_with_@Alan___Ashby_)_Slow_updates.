"Perfect, Tino and Phil just went and got the other stuff so tonight is going to be great. Oh by the way Vic. You're not allowed more than one bottle of beer tonight." Jaime said.
"What? Why?"
"Oh I don't know maybe because last time you got drunk you threw up on me!" He said sarcastically.
"That's stupid. I can manage my own drinking. I don't need a babysitter."
"I never gave you a babysitter, I just said one beer for you but just for saying that- Kellin you're on Vic duty. Don't let him get more than one beer and he's not allowed any of the other alcohol and don't let him touch the drugs either."
"I wasn't gonna go tonight, but I guess I am now." He said, "But why do I have to be on Vic duty?" He whined.
"Because you're the new guy." Mike said and pushed Tony off of the couch. "Ha! In your face you fucking turtle!"
"You asshole!" Tony shouted from the floor, "I've given up. I'm living on the floor forever now."
"Good, that's where loser turtles like you belong anyways." Mike said smugly, "Hey Kellin wanna play?"
"No, thanks though. I have some school stuff to do." He said, "Come get me when the party starts. I'll be in my bunk." He told us and hurried to his bunk. Mike looked at Jaime.
"Wanna play?"
He shook his head, "Hell no, I don't wanna get pushed." He said and looked back at me, "So how was the date?"
"It wasn't a date." I told him, "We got groceries, liquor and had a quick lunch then came back here."
"Yeah but it was a lunch date."
"No it was lunch with a friend."
"Sure it was."
"It was."
"Whatever you say Vic, we all know you're in love with him. Now come play video games with me I'm bored and Tony is a sore loser." Mike whined.
"A handsome poor loser." Tony said still on the floor.
"Yeah sure you are." Mike said rolling his eyes.
"This is my new home."
"Awesome! I say we turn his bunk into the junk bunk!" Jaime said propping his feet up on Tony's back.
"I'm kidding! No junk bunk!" He shouted getting up from the ground.
"It's too late Tony, you decided to live on the floor. You have no say in this now." Jaime said pushing him back on the ground. "Now be a good footrest and stop moving."
"But your feet stink!" He whined.
"No they don't!"
"Yes they do." I said, "Its gross."
"Well that's just mean." He scoffed.
"You have the smelliest feet on the bus!" Mike said.
"Yeah well try having them on you." Tony complained, "I think I'm going to die."
"You're not going to die." Jaime said rolling his eyes.
"How do you know that? He's starting to look sick and I swear to god I am not cleaning it up if he pukes." I said.
He groaned and got up, "You guys are dicks." He muttered and walked off to the bunks.
"No we aren't!" Jaime yelled after him.
