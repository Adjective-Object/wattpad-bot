This room is quite beautiful.
White curtains draped over the double window that lead onto my vine covered balcony.
The rest of the room was just white except my closet.
That was black.
*twitch*
I opened the double doors that lead to my heven and walked into my closet.
I wandered through and eventually reached my personal bathroom that was all black.
I insisted.
*twitch*
I took a quick shower and went to bed.
I woke the next morning right on time.
I took another shower and put on some black jeans and a black t-shirt that had some weird writing on it then left.
*twitch*
I walked to school and noticed I got there rather early.
There was only a few people in the quad so I decided to go sit and read.
*twitch*
After about 5 minutes of reading my book was ripped out of my hands.
I looked up to see some guy hovering above me.
*twitch*
"What's up twitchy!" He laughed I had delt with these types of people before so I just ran.
I found a small staircase and hid.
*twitch*
I heard someone approaching and began to shake.
Nerves cause my anxiety to play up.
*twitch*
I looked up and saw the Tyler look-alike standing across from me.
"Come here!" He yelled.
He dragged me out and pulled me to the main quad where lots of people were.
*twitch*
They began to ridicule me.
Calling me twitchy.
Loser.
Weirdo .
*twitch*
Freak was the worst name.
The bell went but none of the crowd left they just kept standing there and laughing.
*twitch*
The guy that ripped the book out of my hands was there too.
Just as I was about to faint from the panic attack the beautiful girl from math barged through the crowd.
*twitch*
"What are you doing?" She asked the boys.
"Just making fun of little twitchy over hear" he laughed.
*twitch*
"Well stop! Babe I thought I taught you to always be nice!!" She growled.
She then lifted me up and pulled me out of the crowd.
*twitch*
