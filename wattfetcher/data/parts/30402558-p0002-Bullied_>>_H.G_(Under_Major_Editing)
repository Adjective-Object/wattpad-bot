I got up holding my stomach and felt a bruise coming in on my stomach. And a black eye. I open my locker and grabbed my things and went to class.
*skip to end of the school day*
I was waiting at the front of the school when I got a text
Hayes👿😔: come to the back of the school now! Or else.
I didn't answer I just walk to the back of the school
To be continued.....
------------Hey guys! So I got a new account I use to be Hayesismybaeeee but I forgot my password so yeah.
