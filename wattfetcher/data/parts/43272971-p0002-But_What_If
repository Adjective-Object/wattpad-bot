I see them crying. Begging. Just begging me too come back. I want to tell them I'm here but I can't. My throat is on fire and I am numb. Than they stop. They go back into their cars and go home. Days after days in the rain, waiting for them to come and see me. They never did.
My best friend Alex went into depression and barley comes out. He didn't even go to the New Year's Eve drop in New York like we always do. Now he his hair lost all volume and the bags under his eyes are getting heavier for him. He lost so much weight. I wonder why?
My parents are getting old and weak. My dad just found out he has brain tumor and is hearing loss, vision loss, sensory and motor loss, the list goes on. After my father found out my mother is completely blind by than. They will always stick together at the hospital. Even when time is playing his games. It hurts. I don't know why.
My younger brother, well, he's gone. There is not much to it. He died in a car crash when he was twelve. Awful right. They say it was a drunk driver hitting both my brother and his older friend. I say it was karma.
My older sister is a totally a different thing. She never loved me. She never cared for me. Never. It was all about the popularity. I always loved her. Never stopped. It was a promise she broke and that I kept. Until I died. I hated to see her like this. Because of this she is now lost and paranoid.
I'm sitting here. Thinking. On the gravestone. I didn't really pay attention to my surroundings but as soon as I turn around I regret it. It was me. My name. My birthday. Lastly, my death. I am not a ghost nor a person. I am just a memory. But what if?
