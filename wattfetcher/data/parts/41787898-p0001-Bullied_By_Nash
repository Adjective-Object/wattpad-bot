Ugh, my school that hell of a place.
i groaned and got up from my bedI wore a rainbow long shirt with a really short black skirt, then tied my hair into two ponytails, brushed my teeth and went downstairs. I don't even feel like eating breakfast.
I sat on the couch waiting for the bus to come.
Mom:hey sweetie! Don't you want some breakfast??
Me: no thanks mom, I don't feel like eating breakfast.
Mom: oh okay.
As the conversation ended I heard the bus driver honk too loud, I quickly jumped from the couch, held my backpack and ran quickly to the bus.
Inside the bus there were everybody chatting, shouting, laughing.
I looked to the last seat to find my besties sitting waiting for me,
I smiled and headed towards them, as soon as they saw me they smiled too.
Farina: hey Raven! Come takes a seat next to us!
Me:coming!
I went over to them and took a seat next to Taylor and Camelia.
We continued chatting until the bus stopped, signaling that we were already at school.
We quickly got up took our backpacks and went to our lockers,As we arranged our things and took what we needed.
I held my history book with me as we walked to our classes,I realized that I was too late so I started running.
Not after I was pushed to the ground by someone, and I exactly know who it was.
Nash.
