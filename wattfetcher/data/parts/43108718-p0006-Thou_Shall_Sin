"Look." Elizabeth said. "All the other caves are nice and big. Grandma's is so small. She won't like hers."

Gabby looked at Elizabeth confused. "What?"
"We have to make hers pretty like the others." Elizabeth said in a serious tone.

"We can't. I'm not allowed there." Gabby said.
"But I need your help and your my best friend right?" Elizabeth asked. She started to cry. "Maybe you don't want to help me do something nice for my grandma."

"No don't cry. Okay I will help you." Gabby said.
"Cross your heart and hope to die." Elizabeth said.

Gabby placed her finger on her chest and gestured an ex over her shirt. "Cross my heart and hope to die." She said.
