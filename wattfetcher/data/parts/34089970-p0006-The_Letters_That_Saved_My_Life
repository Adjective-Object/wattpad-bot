I had gotten out of the hospital an hour ago. Yes! I had thought at the time, but once we got home I was sent to my room. Now here I am alone with my thoughts, my thoughts might just end up killing me...
I thought as I got on Wattpad. I go to my page and click on people that are following me. Black_Raven192, I'm sure it's him. If it's not....
He hates you, it was an mistake that he found you. It was all a joke, no one cares nor ever will. Give up, you are weak, useless, just go die. If you died no one would care, they'll be happy your gone.The monster spoke. Tears ran down my face at those words.
I'm not weak.
Yes you are. Pathetic, that what you are. No wonder you mother left you... The monster replied.I sobbed at the mention of her. See? The monster asked me as I cried.
Wiping away my tears I glanced down at my phone, still on Wattpad.
What do I have to lose?
I clicked into a private massage, I put in his username.
Hello...
A few minutes later he texted back.
Are you grounded?
Are you stalking me??
No, I just figured that since you ran you would be grounded...
What are you talking about?
I saved you, remember?
I stared at that one massage. I saved you remember? I saved you remember? Remember? I saved you...
Yea.. thank you
Your welcome
How are you?
Fine....
Are you okay...??
Why do you care?!?
I was just,
Just what?!? Trying to get into others personal life??
No... sorry for caring.
Whatever...
I looked down at the phone in my hand. I didn't expect that to blow up in my face...
