A/N- Yeah, not very good, just been rummaging around and found a bunch of really really old stuff I wrote. And since I don't like to alter work that I haven't worked on in a while you guys are gonna get what you get and like it. Mkay? Mkay. Oh yeah almost forgot, this is about cyber bullies.
Don't go back, you don't need to see it again
Don't go back, they are no longer your friends
Don't go back, shut down the page
Don't go back, just stay anonymous always
Don't go back, throw your anger out the door
And when it comes back, beat it to the floor
So don't go back, don't go to that place
Cause you go anywhere and everywhere and never leave a trace
