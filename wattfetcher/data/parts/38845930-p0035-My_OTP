Jordan's POV
"Erin, dizzy?" I asked.
"Yeah, whatever." She responded.
"What? Do you not want to talk about it?" I asked.
"Boo, go play." She said kissing Boo's head.
"What?" I asked.
"I stood up and got dizzy, that's it." She said.
"That's not it. I know you, there's something else bothering you."
"Jordan! Stop prying!" She screamed.
"Sorry." I said.
"I'll tell you later." She said before giving me a kiss on the cheek. "Okay?" She asked.
"Alright." I agreed.
We left the park to drop Boo off at her dad's house.
Erin's POV
"Hey!" (Insert ex's name here) said to Boo.
"Daddy!" She screamed.
"Alright Boo, come gimme a hug." I said.
"Hey, babe." He said.
"Stop." I said. Jordan was standing at the car watching the entire thing.
"Stop what, baby?" He said as he put his arm around me. I heard Jordan grunt and start to walk, I swung my hand back signaling for him to stay back.
"Oh, is that your boyfriend?" He asked.
"Yes, but your not. Boo go inside, I love you." I said. Boo ran inside with the look of sheer fear on her face
"Oh, you made her upset." He said pushing me back into the railing of the stairs we were standing on.
"Stop it!" I said as I ran to the car and into Jordan's arms.
"Oh, your protecting your baby?" He asked.
"Yeah, I am. It seems like you don't care." Jordan said.
"Oh, I wouldn't br surprised if you were the one to brake her arm." He said.
"Oh please, he was there, he cares. He was the one who took me to the hospital, the one who comforted me when I cried rather than being the one who made me cry! He was the on who helped me back up when I was down rather than kicking me. He loves me, and you never did!" I screamed before getting in the car.
"Sure, like I'd buy that shit!" He screamed.
"Go to hell!" Jordan and I both yelled.
Jordan got in the car and started the engine only to find I was hiding my crying from (Insert ex's name here), he drove without saying anything to keep it hidden untill we were far enough away that (insert ex's name here) wouldn't see.
--does anyone else feel like his name is David or Chistopher? No, just me? Okay--
