Seth's POV I f*cking kissed her...she probably hates me now. Wait. She has a smile on her face!
"Thanks for the date Colby. I had a great time."
She said opening her hotel door and placing a kiss on my cheek. Then she closed the door.
Dani's POVWhen I closed the door I did my little happy dance. Then I finally noticed that the Bella's where siting on my bed.
They flooded me with questions."How did it go?" "Did he pay for dinner?" "How was the kiss?" "Did he touch u below the equator?"
And I said "Good. We went to the movies and I didn't pay for nothing. And how did you know we kissed. And no Brie he didn't touch me below the equator,"
Nikki and Brie stayed at my hotel room and we had like a slumber party but except Brie went to sleep really early so yea.
