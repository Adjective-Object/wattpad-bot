I got home just to see my dad already waiting for me at the door."Youre late, you know?" Still panting, I answered "yes dad""Give that to me" he said as he grabbed the bag of beer I had on my hand. "Youre a lazy idiot, you are useless-" he interrupted himself , opened a can, took a sip, and then added "but I guess you already know it, bastard. Why dont you kill yourself huh? You would do the world a favour. Nobody needs you. I lost everything I loved, I wouldnt care if i lost something I despise" I remained quiet and headed for my room."Were are you going?" he shouted from downstairs. "We will finish this tomorrow".I just shouted from my room "good night". I changed clothes, turned off the light, and let the tears stream down my face. Then, i took out the paper harry had given me. When I unfolded it I saw his number, written in fast, but still beautiful handwritting. I wanted to call him, I wanted to talk to someone, but if i did that, it would only make my dad go crazy. So I decided it to call him another day.I tried to sleep, but i couldnt. So I opened a drawer, took out my pencil sharpener and i started removing the screw, I took out the blade and felt the cold touch of it against my skin. The blood started dripping almost instantly, I liked the way it looked  "I deserve this" I thought while I started cleaning the bood from my arm.
"Maybe he is right, maybe no one needs me, maybe i should die" With those thoughts devouring my mind, I fell asleep
