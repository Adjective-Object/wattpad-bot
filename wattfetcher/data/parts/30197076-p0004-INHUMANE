If It Wasnt For the Presents And Ballons Everywhere, It'd Be Mistaken For Some Drunken Teenagers Party.
As She Reached Her destination, She Thought Of Opening Them, you know Just Take a Little peak, But She Knew Her Mother Would Start Scolding Her So She Thought Better of It.
Though, she Couldnt Help But Start Reading The Cards On Each Present.
'Im Sending Sixteen Hugs And Kisses your Way For Your 16th Birthday ! Enjoy The Awesomeness !!'
-Virginia, The Cool Chicka ;)
'Wishing a Happy, Happy Birthday To The Most Special And Memorable Person I Know ! Enjoy It !'
-Alaric, Your Drunken Bff.
'Let Your 16th Year help You Break New Grounds and Take You Further Than You Could Have Ever Imagined. Have a Great One-of-a-kind Birthday !! Enjoy To The Max ! P.S:Call Me Anytime Babe.'-Fransisco.
Upon Reading Franny's Card, She Let Out A Humorous Laugh..
'Oh That Boy Will Never Change.' She Thought, Shaking Her Head, The Smile Still Tugging On Her Lips.
She Knew That Although She Was With Aiken, He Wont Stop. He Was Such An Incorrigible Flirt.
Suddenly, As She Was Reading Another Card, A Hand Gripped Her Arm And Started Dragging Her Away As She Struggled To Walk Forward.
"Your Mom Would Slaughter you If She Found You Standing Here ! " Samara Yelled, Her Voice Barely Audible With All The Music In The Background.
As They Approached the Dance Floor, A Hand Wrapped Around Both Of Brianna's Wrists Before She Was Crushed Into A Tight Hug. The Vanilla And Chocolate Scent Of Her Hair Immediately Alerted Her To Who Her 'Attacker' Was.
Janice Jade Jagger.
Stupid, Hilarious Bitch But She Loves Her.
She Pulled Away And Stood, A Few Inches taller, As She Held Brianna's Wrists In Her Hand Before Wiping A Fake Tear As She Stared at Her Proudly.
"Oh My Babe Is Growing Up !" She Squealed out, Before Crushing Her Into Another Bear Hug.
'Gosh I Should Get An X-ray On How My Ribs Look Like Now.' She Thought.
Probably Severly Damaged.
"J-j-anice you're..Cru-sh-ing m-eee." Brianna Squealed Out Loud In Her Ear Before She Accidentally released Her As She Held Her Ears Painfully.
Brianna Quickly Sent Her An Apologetic Look Before She Quickly Whirled Around Just in Time to Catch Samara Before Hugging The Floor.
God, This Girl Was Drunk Already.
She Steadied her Before She Laughed Out Loud At Brianna's Stupid Expression In Which She Was Staring At her Might I Say Creepily.
"Hey, Did You Know That In some cultures, Age is a sign of distinction that demands respect. Tell me. How many years of respect do I owe you?" She Asked, A Silly Smile Tugging At her Lips Making Brianna Roll My Eyes and Reply.
"Oh Hun, It Doesnt Work Like This." She Retorted back, Laughing Before A Hand Wrapped Around Her Waist Protectively, Pulling Her Away From Them. Brianna Whirled Around, Only To Be Caught In A Pair Of Two Peacock Blue Eyes That Seemed To Engross Her Deeply And Pierce Into Her Soul.
Aiken.
