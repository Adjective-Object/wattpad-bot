Hey guys heres Chapter 2!
Chapter 2
Shea's P.O.V
Boxes.
They where absolutely EVERYWHERE in my house at the moment.
"Mom! Are we all packed?" I called from my room.
"I think! Brad, Seth and the movers should be here any minute!" She yelled back.
I huffed and collapsed on my bare mattress. Everything from a couple days came flooding back. That whole scene with Seth. I mean he had no right listening to what I was saying! It was rude! And then he had the ball's so call me a cry baby! Ugh the nerve of him! He hasn't said anything to me about it. Don't think he has said anything to anyone... I hope. I'll ask him when he gets here.
I heard the front door open and my mom screech with joy. I heard some mumbles and then someone coming to my room. I heard a knock.
"Who is it?" I asked
"Seth let me in, our parents are being gross" I laughed.
"Yeah sure, but i'm warning you there are a lot of boxes!" I said with a smile. He walked in and closed the door behind him. He started walking back over to my bed and triped! "OH MY GOD! HAHAHAHA! Are you okay?" I asked him helping him up.
"Yeah, thanks"
"Hey I warned you!" I siad with a smile. "It was your job to watch where you where going" I said sitting back down on my bed. He followed and sat down as well. We sat there for a couple minutes. An awkward silence filing the room.
"About the other day" We both said at the same time.
"You go first" We both said again.
"No you" I said this time.
"No its fine just say what you need to" He said back. He cross crossed his legs and faced me. Our eyes meeting for a brief second.
"I just wanted to ask you if you said anything to anyone" I said softly.
"Why would I do that?" He asked
"Because you're, you're you!" I said raisning my voice.
"Yeah I am me, that doesn't mean I'm going to go tell people you cried because your dad died. I mean its expected. Who doesn't cry when someone they ove so much passes away. Me I'm not one to cry though, but I know people do. My dad cried when my mom died. I kinda just shut people out. I mean it was hard for us. I stopped talking to him for the longes-" He stopped and looked at me. "I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't need to explain myself and my problems to you" And the is the jerk that we all know and remember!
"Its fine. I could care less, just like you do. I didn't need you listening to my problems. Its quiet annoying actually. I can handle myself. I don't need pity, I don't need people telling me everything is going to be okay, or I know its hard! They have no freaking idea how hard it is! People are so stupid! I can barely look at my mom after what she did! I'm not going to give you pity because it doesn't help a situation! I mean I know pity might help you but it just makes me feel worse! How can someone sit there and say they know how you feel, or try to help you if they actually really don't have any idea! I just wann-" Seth placed his hands on my cheek and I instantly went silent. His fingers felt like fire on my skin. What the fuck?
"You need to relax! God. Its kinda cute when you go off on a rampage like that tho" He smiled. He dropped his hands and I continued to look at him confused.
