I woke up in Nialls arms and felt so safe. He was like my brother and I hope it will stay like this. I checked my phone and saw a new message.. From Ashton.. "I know you won't talk to me, but I need to say that I still love you.. When you left I noticed how much I needed you! Please Maybelle! I love you" I didn't answer.. I walked downstairs without waking Niall up and gave Denny and Casey some food. Soon I saw Louis in the door looking at me. "I'm so sorry" he said. I just looked at him and sat down on the floor. How can they just stand there and say how sorry they are? Louis, Harry and Ash.. Fuck! I want Harry! No others, just him.. Even though I like Louis' eyes and Ashtons laugh.. Harry has everything! I smiled to him and walked upstairs to get dressed. It was pretty cold so I took a hoodie and jeans. I also took a blanket and a pillow downstairs so I could chill on the couch the rest of the day. -30 minutes later-I was laying on the couch when Harry came over to me and layed down next to me. He held me tight and I layed my head on his chest. I saw that Louis was so jealous, but I tried not to care about it. Niall maked lunch for us and Casey and Denny was playing outside. They never went anywhere without me or some of the boys. They always was here. Zayn and Liam was soon coming over and we was all going to hang out with each other. "Are you okay?" Harry asked me and I noticed a tear on my cheek. "Uhm.. Yea.. It's okay" I said and smiled. I saw that he didn't believe me, but I couldn't tell him that Louis likes me and the text from Ash.. Cuddled with Niall all night.. How did Harry and Louis even get in the house this morning? Harry has a key.. Maybe they came together?
