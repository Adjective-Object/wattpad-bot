Don't worry, those ships carry the bodies  Of the ones you'll think will be forgotten, but in reality They give them something close to heaven Intended for love, reprimanded for hate, conformed for the conscious  Molded for what we want yet broken for morals Dance, hold the pieces closely as they cut into the flesh of the arms Pressing the illusion of the expected to be sunken  Beneath the skin, lost only to always carve deeper, deeper Still, few actually stare at the pieces Shattered on the asphalt, glistening with red, white and gold Gleaming with promise, daring the few to not lift  Each shard from the blackness, the depth Those who desire to loose, are placed in the ships Discarded with the most diligent care, delicately wrapped with remorse  As the ships drift off into the horizon Falling off the ledge Into what we wish to be a golden world
