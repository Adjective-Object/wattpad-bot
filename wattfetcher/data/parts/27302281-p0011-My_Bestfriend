" good.. wait what did you say Channing Tatum " he said. Staring at me
" yeah he's sexy " I smirked
" and I'm not " he said looking down at me while still hovering over me
". Nah " I joked
" oh " he said frowning with disappointment in his eyes and getting off me
" I'm joking Justin " I said pulling him back on top of me and kissed hissoft plumb lips
" i love you" I said pulling away then kissing him again
" iloveyoutoo with no spaces " he said giving me a goofy grin
" why no spaces " I asked
" because with our love there is no room for anyone else " he smiled kissing my forehead
" your so cheesy " I said smiling and pecked him on the lips
Then he planted his plumb lips on mine and I kissed back of course then I pulled away and walked off to open the door.

" I'm opening the door didn't you hear a knock " I asked looking at him weird

" hey baby " I said smiling at him
