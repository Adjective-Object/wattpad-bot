Okay, i have recently re-watched Lion 3: Straight to Video and i noticed everything that was inside Lions mane. Basically Rose's most personal treasures, and it makes you wonder, what is Lion's connection with Rose Quartz? Well let's first list all the things that are inside his mane, shall we?
1: The mysterious Bubbled gem artifact, and or gem.
2: Rose's battle flag.
3: Rose's Sword.
4: A picture of Rose and Greg.
5: The shirt Greg gave Rose shortly after they first met
6: The tape for Steven.
7: And the mysterious treasure chest filled with who knows what.
Lets start with the bubbled gem. This caught my attention when i first saw it, and i began to wonder, why was it inside Lion's mane? I think they will explain this latter, but it leaves me to wonder. Why was that gem or gem artifact so important to Rose?  And what the heck is it?
Theory time! I think that the bubbled thing is a quite possibly some sort of gem that was close to Rose, like maybe its the first gem to join her rebellion.
Now we know what Rose's flag is, it's the one she carried in to battle 5 thousand years ago, and we know about Rose's sword. The picture self explanatory, the tape is also. And the treasure chest, i got nothing on that.
Now on to Lion, i think that Lion was ordered by Rose before she gave birth to Steven to watch and protect Steven after she either created him or gave him powers to do so.
Now that i'm finished i will update as soon as possible.
