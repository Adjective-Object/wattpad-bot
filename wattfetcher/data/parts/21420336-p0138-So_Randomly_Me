I forgot I downloaded wattpad on my moms phone and left it signed it with notifications
Nico: *waves hands* surprise, she forgot something xD
Anyways she saw the update about my friends calling me gay and well the convo went like this:"Sandy why do your friends call you gay? Are you gay?"
Me: *gets nervous* "haha no what me gay no I like guys what yeah boobs dont have ant affect on me. No yeah my friends are idiots"
I already talked about me being gay with my mom and she said she would accept it but she thinks I am confused
If only she knew i had a girlfriend before and I was happier than ever xD

Nico: *whispers* she probably didnt damn
