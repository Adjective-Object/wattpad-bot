Another hour has passed, which marks the 10th hour.we finally hear the intercom go off and the pilot begins to speak, "We have now reached our destination, welcome to America." Boy was I glad to hear that! Relief and anxiety is what I'm feeling. I see our limousine has made it here and so did a hoard of paparazzi. Just what I needed. The butler helps load our stuff in the limo and we're gone in a heartbeat.
When I take a look around here, I noticed that Texas isn't bad and the fact that we're going to Austin, the capital of Texas, is pretty cool. It's peaceful here and I like it! So far it's clear and no one seems to have seen me.
Add another hour into the time that we've been trying to get to our destination. Now we are finally here! Bruce does have a nice house. It's 2 stories high, it actually has a front and backyard, and a garage. Down the street I could see a park, and further down the road I could see a creek. It looks stunning but I guess it could be considered ordinary here.
