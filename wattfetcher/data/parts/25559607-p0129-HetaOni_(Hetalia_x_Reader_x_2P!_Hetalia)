---CHAPTER X: BLOOD (Part 1)---

(((Italy's PoV)))

The only thing I remember vividly,

to the point I can't breathe,

is when we first came here.

Even while everyone was trying to think of

a way to escape,

I did nothing to help...

I had to be protected like an idiot...

Meanwhile, everyone else was getting hurt.

And I was alone.

One after the other,

they lost their lives right before my eyes.

"Huhu

...I'm sorry. It looks like this is the end for me." Japan croaked out, barely able to move.

"D-Don't say that! Wait just a minute! I'll make bandages out of this flag and stop the bleeding!" I told him, tears running down my cheek.

Japan did his best effort to shake his head, "No... no, it's hopeless. There is no time. Please, just leave me here and go to the others. Fortunately, they've forgotten...that I came here. Please, leave me..."

"Of course I can't do that! Just--I'll make bandages right now! Please!" I frantically tried to search my pockets for at least a piece of cloth.

"Italy."

"Wh-what?"

"You don't have your white flag any more, do you? You have already used all of it to make bandages for everyone else." Japan said. He knows... He knows that..but...

"No! I-I do!! L-Look! I just made it! I'll help you right now!!

... No, Japan!! I'll do anything!! I'll do anything!!! Just hold on a little longer!" I was pleading him with all I could muster. I just... This...This isn't happening...
