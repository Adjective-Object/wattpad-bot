Simon's POV :
"So, I was thinking about the project and found-"
"AAAAAHHHHH" I was cut off by a loud scream and a loud bang right after it.
"It's Leena" Damon ran upstairs and I followed him with Elina and his mom.
Damon pushed the door " OH MY GOD"
We saw her body lying on the floor while her head was dying the floor with red dye.
"SHE'S BLEEEING" Elina shouted.
"CALL THE HOSPITAL" Mrs.Carter shouted to Damon.
"No, she'll bleed much more if we stand here waiting for the ambulance. Give me some bandages and sterilizer" They all stared at me.
"QUICK" I shouted and ran to Leena, Mrs.Carter went to get what I wanted.
"Can you help her ?" Elina asked me worriedly.
"I'll do my best" I sat beside Leena.
"No, go away Simon, we can't risk. I won't let you try some First Aid moves you've learned in school" Damon said aggressively and pushed me.
"It's either me or the amulance that will come in 30 minutes" Leena's breath wasn't as it should be.
Damon caught the hem of my shirt ans stared right in my eyes "You better do your best"
And that was a sneak peek from chapter 15 MMMWAAAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAAH
I'M SUCH A BAD PERSON HAHA.
