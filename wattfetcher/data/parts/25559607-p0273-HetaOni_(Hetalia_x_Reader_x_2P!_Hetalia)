Germany looked behind to call after Italy. "Oh, come on! Italy, just get down!"
"Please! Somehow...somehow...!Â Make me-make me disappear somewhere!!" Italy said loudly, opening the journal.
Romano saw this and panicked. "Veneziano!!"
"Italy's journal!!" Japan alerted the others as he saw Italy hold out the book in front of him.
"Italy!!" Germany yelled, running towards Italy and grabbing the journal.
"G-Germany! My journal!" Italy said, the book being tugged back in forth between him and the German.
The (h/c) haired girl quickly walked over to them. "(N-Name)! Come back!" Canada called out.
(Name) looked back and spoke, "No, I-I know what's going to--"
"Let go of it, Italy!! The journal-Ah, dammit! You always---" Germany said, looking straight into Italy's amber orbs. He suddenly stopped when he noticed something strange happening.
The journal began to emanate a bright light, surrounding them.
And in a blink of an eye, they were gone.
