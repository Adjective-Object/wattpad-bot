Hey, I know I said I wasn't going to write one for you but here I am. You were amazing. You were a great listener and an even better friend. Thank you for keeping me alive for as long as you did. Thank you for being there. I just don't want you to be at my funeral. I don't want you to meet my fake family. I don't want you to listen to the speeches about how I was a loved daughter. I don't want you to be sad. I don't want you to see me in a dress. I don't want you to see my cold body in a casket. I don't want you to mourn. I would like for you to smile. Don't remember these last months. Don't remember the sad times. Remember the weird movie trips. Remember the time I threw my phone at your friend and made a terribly awkward scene. Remember our first Skype calls and how strange they were. Remember when you tried to scare me by talking about the creepy guy with the red eyes in my closet even though I knew it wasn't real. Remember all the silly selfies I sent you. Remember how I can't sing. Remember Emily and how you roasted her for me. Remember the memes I made for you. Remember beating me at left 4 dead... several times...Just remember the good. Don't remember my body. I know I'm abandoning you. I know I will be hurting you. And I'm so sorry. But I don't think I can keep doing this. Maybe I'll be back with my Angel. I love you. There's so much more I could say but I'd go on forever. I'm sorry.
You were my tree and my bull.
Love, Ashton06/07/2015
