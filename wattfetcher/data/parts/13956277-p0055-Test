"Hey" I turned my face to face .. Helen ?
"Hello ! what are you doing here?" I asked happily
"Playing hide and seak" She answered sarcastically.
"Hand me those" I took the clothes in her hands.
"94 dollars" I said.
"Come on ! you're my friend .. no discounts ??" She smiled.
"I'm your friend, I don't own the place" I giggled. The boss glared at me and cleared her throat.
"Sorry, no chats. NEXT PLEASE" I dealed with the next cotomer, Helen moved to the left to make room for the next costomer.
"I've missed you" She said
"I saw you before yesterday" I giggled "20 dollars please" I smiled to the costomer.
"You're my special friend, I can miss you whenever I want" She faked some tears.
"We can have coffee, my breake is in 10 minutes" I said.
"Okay, I'll walk around until you finish" She left.
I went to change the uniform the grumpy boss made me wear, I saw a little box between my clothes and a little paper.
You look hot in the uniform.
- Secret Admirer.
What ? secret admirer ? Now my life is PERFECT ! who is that stalker ? WHAT IF HE WAS A SERIAL KILLER  !!! should I open the box ? what if it contains EXPLOSIVES !!!
mind: nobody puts explosives in a little pink box and writes you a letter on it.
me: Oh, I'll open it later, Helen's waiting for me.
I took my bag after I stuffed the box in it.
"I'm here" Helen waved at me.
"Why didn't you wait for me, we were supposed to drink coffee together" I frowned.
"Sorry but I coudn't resist the cold Mocha" She giggled.
"I'll get one" I entered Starbucks and took my delicious cold Mocha.
"So how are you" Helen smiled.
"Hamdullah, I'm fine" I took a sip from my cup.
-Secret Admirer.
"What's wrong ? you seem distracted" Was it that obvious?
"I found this between my clothes" I pulled the box out of my bag.
"Awwh, how cute, who put it in there" She opened the box.
"Oh-Mah-God" She pulled a perfume from the box.
"Do you have any idea about the price of this thing ?" Her eyes widened.
"No" I pulled my phone and checked my facebook.
"more than 300 dollars" She said slowly, my jaw dropped.
"What ?" I raised an eyebrow.
"I'm telling you girl, who sent you this precious perfume is interested in you" Helen said and I giggled.
"Oh really, too bad he didn't leave his name" I faked some tears.
"He'll come back after you babe, he'll come back" She said dramatically.
"What-ever" I snapped the box and perfume from her hands and threw them in somewhere between the fake plastic trees.
