Show me what it's like
To kiss the northern lights.
Take me to breathtaking heights.
Where you can't tell the days from the nights.
Yeah, that's what I'd like.
I feel repetitive in all that I do
But not when I'm writing about you.
I'd like to never have to remember two plus two.
In general, I want to be with you.
Every day.
Every minute.
Every breathing moment I live.
Every morning I wake,
I want to wake to you.
I stopped rhyming the lines,
That's how real this got
