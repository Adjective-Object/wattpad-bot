My dearest ______,
I love you. I love you so, so much; I want you to know that when I'm gone. What I did, or will do does not concern you. None of this is your fault, my dear.
I haven't been exactly honest with you, though. And it is my fault that you will be in the future pain, but you will get over it. Everyone will at some point. I'm sorry but I cannot and will not explain to you why I'm doing this, not on paper; we all have our reasons and I like to hide mine. My hurt and secrets will die with me.
So you will not know it, but you feel it. Remember, this is not your fault. I love you.
Sincerley,
Her.

His eyes scanned the letter, adrediline and shock flowing through his veins. He had no clue why, but he had to find her before it was too late.
"Watcha doing?" His Pa asked.
"I'm going to her," He said as he sped out the door. He travelled past the houses, forgetting that he had a car. His mind was blank beside from the image of Her glued in the back of His eyelids. As He reached Her street then Her house, He had hope that He had made it.
How little did He know that He was too late.
