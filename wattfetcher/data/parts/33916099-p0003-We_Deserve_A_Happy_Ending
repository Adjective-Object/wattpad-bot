We heard the keys jingling and the front door open. "BAE, HOOKER wea yall at?!" Shenika said.
"In my room hoe!" I yelled.
She came in kissed Jay and plopped down in my queen size bed. "Well what did I miss in this lil chat session?" She said .
"We seen Dominic today." Jay said.
Shenika eyes got wide motioning her hand for me to spill the tea. "And how did that go?"
"Bih he want to talk I said fuck all that. I gave you five years of my life. Ion wanna hear none of that dumb shit."
"Nae' you could atleast hear what the man got to say. I know what he did was fucked up but atleast hear what he has to say. You know he love you." Jay said.
"He right girl. Atleast hear him out. And if he say some stupid shit we'll whoop his ass."
"Ion know if I wanna hear what the fuck he got to say.. He hurt me too bad. And you know if I woulda did that to him he'd shoot some shit up."
"Take it from a nigga who know about that cheating shit--"
"Nigga the fuck you mean?!" Shenika said sizing Jayden.
"Bae I'm talking bout before we got together chill."
"Oh. Shit say that next time." She said.
I just shook my head.
"Like I was saying.. If a nigga tell you it ain't mean shit and he actually trying to make things right then he's genuinely sorry. Just talk to that man Nae'."
"We'll see." I said.
My mind is saying fuck what he has to say! But my heart is like girl go talk to that boy cause you know it's some unfinished business that needs to be dealt with. I want to follow my heart but my mind keep replaying how he did me wrong.. I gotta sleep on this one.
It wasn't much but I tried! I know yall have been missing Dominic and Jenae' and they are officially back. Yall know what to do. Vote and give me feedback.
