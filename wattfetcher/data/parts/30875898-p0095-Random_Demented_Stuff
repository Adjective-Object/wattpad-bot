Don't you dare, ever, call me your equal. I do not want to be equals with someone who is racist, homophobic, or sexist.
I don't want to be equals with someone who calls people 'queer', 'faggot', or 'dyke'.
I don't want to be equals with someone who calls people 'nigga', 'cracker', or someone who thinks they're better than someone else because of their skin color.
I don't want to be equals with someone who says, 'bitch', 'whore',Â  'slut', or someone who thinks one gender is better than the other one.
Don't you, ever, call me your equal. I'm not your equal. But I'm not above or below you.
I'm going to be as far away from you as humanly possible... :)
