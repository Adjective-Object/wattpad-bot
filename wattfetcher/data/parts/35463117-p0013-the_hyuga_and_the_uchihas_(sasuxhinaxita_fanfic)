"This?" I asked him.
The room was in fair condition, there was a bed in a corner big enough for two people and gray carpet. A window brought fresh storm light in as it was still raining. It was a decent room.
"It'll be 300 each." The creepy man said.
"Here." I said giving him enough for us both.
"How long will you be staying?"
"A week. Any additional costs?"
"Only a small fee in the end if there is any damage. But that we can worry about later." He said. "My name is kikure."
"Whatever. You can go now." I said as he left. I shut the door to the room and locked it. "Man was he weird."
"I'll agree." Hinata said.
"I would strongly suggest staying close to me." I said to hinata. "That guy gives me the creeps."
"You wanna walk around?" Hinata asked. "Maybe we'll hear a good conversation."
"Sounds like a good idea. I'm kinda hungry too." I agreed.
So we walked around the town.
No ones point of view.
Hinata and sasuke sat on a bench somewhere in the small town.
"You want a drink?" Sasuke asked.
"Sure." Hinata replied happily.
"Be back in a sec." Sasuke said walking away towards a drink machine.
Across the street were 2 men.
"That one looks yummy." Said one.
"Yeah I bet she'd be fun." Replied the other. "Who gets her first?"
"I will." Said the first. "I'd like to play with her for a while. You can leave now."
"Pfft, whatever." Said the second as he walked away.
Hinata POV
A man came up to me while I was waiting for sasuke.
"Hello sir." I said politely.
"Hello, tell me, are you with someone?" He asked.
"My boyfriend. He should be here shortly." I said using our cover.
"He's most likely ditched you. For I don't see anyone else."
"Hey babe." Sasuke said sitting next to me. "This guy giving you any trouble?"
Sasuke didn't let me answer right away, because he kissed me. When he pulled away I answered half shakily.
"N..no. I'm fine." I said. Gah! My first kiss was stolen by him! He's cool and all but it won't be such a secret for long. Those fangirls will be up my ass 9 miles in every direction now!
"Hmmmm, I'll leave now." The man said.
