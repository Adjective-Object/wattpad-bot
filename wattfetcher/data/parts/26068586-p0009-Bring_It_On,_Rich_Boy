Why did he come in today?
I looked around the classroom and saw that Ashton Lawson wasn't here.
That's weird.
When lunch rolled round I didn't want to sit in the canteen with the others so I made my way outside and went to sit in the dance room which wasn't locked. The dance room was really big; the two walls opposite each other were brick walls, one was plain white and the other one was all mirrors. There were pictures hanging on the walls of different famous dancer from all different kinds of dances.
I closed the door behind me and went to sit down by the massive round window which you could see the field from.
I stared out the window and looked around the field. I stopped as I spotted Ashton on the feild. Not Ashton Lawson, Ashton Prince... argh I need nicknames for them. How bout Ash for Ashton Prince and Ashton for Ashton Lawson... yeah you get what I mean.
I watched as Ash played football with his friends on the field. It was a nice day so nearly everyone was outside. Then Ash stopped running and Lia came to give him a water bottle.
I need to get him alone.
Suddenly he looked up and automatically looked my way. I didn't even think before falling onto the floor and nearly breaking my ankle.
Did he see me?
I looked back up and he went back to playing football.
That was close.
Suddenly I heard the door creak open so I turned around and was surprise about the person standing by the door.
