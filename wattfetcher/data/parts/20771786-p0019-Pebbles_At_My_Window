She takes a deep breath. "Why are you naked?" she asked so sweetly and innocent.
I'm not... What.. I'm.. Oh.
I see down beyond the covers underneath that there seems to be something poking up. Oh, my bad.
"I could ask you the same question." I reply to her.
"I'm more covered than you." she protests.
"Not my fault." I snap back at her.

"Not my fault." he snaps at me which makes my eyes bulge.
If it's not his fault then who is it?
Oh I don't know YOU!
"So you're saying it's my fault?" I snap ready to throw him out my 2 story window. Still naked.
"Yea, you're the one that said it was way too hot in here and that I should take my clothes off. Don't you remember?" Marcus whispered like it was a huge secret to the world.
I did what now? Him being pants-less is all my doing?
"I like you better with pants on."
