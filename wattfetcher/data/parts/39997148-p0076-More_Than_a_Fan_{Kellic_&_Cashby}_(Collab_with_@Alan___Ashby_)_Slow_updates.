I sighed, "Okay tell me when they're here or something!"
"Okay!" He said and I didn't bother responding as I stared up at the ceiling. I'm dying of boredom right now.  There was nothing to do on this bus. The guys broke the xbox yesterday and Kellin has been hiding in his bunk threatening to kill anyone who bugs him and I need to be entertained.
I might have to risk being murdered. I jump out of my bunk and push the curtain to Kellins back to find him curled in a ball with his blanket pulled over his head.
"Kells." I said poking his side.
"Vic if you don't go away I will kill you." He said.
"I'm bored."
"I could care less. Go away."
"No, come on. I'm bored." I whined.
"Go away Vic, I'm not in the mood."  He said in a pissy tone.
"Whats wrong?"
"I don't want to talk about it."
"Its not good to bottle things up."
"Yeah well I'm bottling this up for a while." He said.
"You're just going to get madder." I told him poking his side again.
"Come on Vic leave me alone."
"I'll leave you alone for now, but only if you promise to tell me what's wrong later." I tell him.
"Later now go."
"Fine, I'm going Mr. Pissy Pants." I said standing up, "But I will be back and just as a warning three insane women are going to be here at any minute so be careful."
He groaned, "No."
"Yes," I mimicked before leaving the bunks and went to the front with the guys.
"I'm so excited and I just can't hide it." Jaime said jumping and dancing around.
I rolled my eyes, "Calm down."
"Don't tell me to calm down Vic! Unlike you who gets their boyfriend to tour with him I haven't seen Jess in so long and I miss her." He said glaring at me.
"Excuse me, he's not my boyfriend." I said, "And they're gonna be with us for like a week calm down."
"Shut up Vic you don't get it." Mike said, "I finally get to see Alysha!" He squealed happily.
"Are you sure you aren't gay Mike?"
"Oh I'm definitely sure I'm not." He said.
"You're sure?"
"Yes Vic. I'm sure." He said just as the door to the bus opened.
"Guess who's here!" One of the girls said as they all three hurried in and ran to their boyfriends. I rolled my eyes and sat down resting my head on my hand. Here comes the squeals and the yelling and the PDA.
I groaned and just sat listening to them all catching up with each other.
"Oh my god I missed you so much!" Alysha squealed.
"Whats going on?" I looked up and saw Kellin with a confused look on his face.
"Their girlfriends are here for the week." I told him ready to bang my head against the wall.
"Oh wow."
"Just so you know- they're insane so be careful." I told him.
