"Genetics." I simply answer. "My dad's tall." I add.
"Lucky." She laughs. "Well, I'm going to the sports club booth to sign my name up. See you later, I guess?" She smiles and dismisses herself.
I walk around the main hall and finally see the camera club's booth. "Hey, interested in joining us?" The girl at the booth asks, handing me a flyer.
"I am." I smile. She returns my smile and hands me the list of name. I write down my name, phone number and age on the name list. "Here you go." I give the name list to the girl.
"Thanks for signing up. We have a meeting this evening after dinner at the camera room. Here's my number just in case. See you!" The girl informs. I nod and leave the booth to find Melody.
"Jules! I'm here!" I hear Melody's voice coming from behind. I see her running towards me.
"Have you signed up?" I ask.
"Yeah! We're gonna have a meeting after dinner." She replies excitedly.
"Same." I chuckle. "Can we find something to eat? I'm quite hungry." I say.
"Yup. Come on. I know a delicious place to eat." Melody replies, dragging me to find someplace to eat.
