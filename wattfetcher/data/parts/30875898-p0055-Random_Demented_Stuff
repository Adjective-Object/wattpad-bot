An old friend that I haven't seen in four years sees me at the mall a few days ago. He comes up to me and asks, "Oh hey, long time no see! So how are you feeling?"
•alone
•anxious
•confused as to why you'd talk to me after you already got rid of me
•depressed
•disgusted by myself
•fat
•homicidal
•sick of being in this body
•suicidal
•unwanted
•used up and ready to disappear
My reply, "I'm fine, how are you doing?"
