"Shut up." He said as he took a big swig of what could have been his 100th beer of the week.
"Don't." Jordan said not even facing him.
'CRASH'
He threw his beer bottle at us luckily missing us by an inch.
(Bold is the dude Jordan is regular slant is Erin)
"Dude!" Jordan screamed.
"What do you know?" He asked.
"Nothing, man." Jordan said while opening the door to my house letting me in first.
"C'mon, come at me. If you don't I might take your girl."
"Hey, dont touch her!" He screamed.
"I do what I want."
"Except for mess with my girl! Trust me, you don't want to do that!"
"Oh, I don't? Maybe I do, did you think of that?"
"You're a drunk!"
"Oh, I am? I'm not. A drunk? I am not a drunk! Drunk!?"
"Just lay off!"
"No thanks."
"Go to hell." I whispered only loud enough for Jordan to hear me say.
"Come here." He said as he walked to the doorway.
"Get out of here!" Jordan said pushing him almost making him fall over.
"Ahh! Jordan!" I screamed when he threw a punch, Jordan dodged.
"Jordan stop! You're gonna get hurt."
"Stay inside please."
"She can come out."
"No she can't!" He said throwing a puch hitting the guy in the mouth making me scream again.
"Jordan stop! Ahh Jordan! Jordan!" I said crying while running to him after he got punched in the gut.
"He's all yours now sweets." He said while walking away and grabbing a bottle opener from is back pocket.
I contemplated running after and kicking him in the balls... but Jordan was more important than getting some sort of revenge on the guy.Drunk!
