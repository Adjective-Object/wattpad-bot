Lauren and Arden never experienced anything even remotely similar to what Jenn had for the last couple of years, and even though Jenn didn't put her faith to any higher power, she prayed to God that they never had to experience something as terrible as losing everyone.
Lauren and Arden may have thought Jenn was unnecessarily being an asshole, but everyone has their reasons. It was just something people did after getting hurt; They close up, give up, and grow cold. The funny thing was, she wasn't cold at all, she plainly thought people were inherently evil and were only out to hurt people, ruin their innocence.
Despite every belief her friends had about her, there was only one version of the truth behind this terrible person - She was hiding a secret, but she was just tired of it, tired of herself. But wouldn't anybody be tired of themselves if they had to hide from the world?
