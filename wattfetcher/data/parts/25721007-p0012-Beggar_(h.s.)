"I know, I know. You're scared because of what happened last time, but you shouldn't be,"
"It's hard. Okay," he sighed.
"Fine, but next time you mess up, don't come running to me,"
I walked away before they came out. Who could they be talking about? Harry doesn't seem like the type to be worried or scared of some girl. It's weird. I just wish I knew what they were speaking about.
"Lennon? You okay?" Eleanor asked from behind me. She looked concerned.
"Yeah, yeah. I was just heading back down to Zayn," I gave her a small smile. Harry was standing behind her, his eyes boring holes into mine.
"Oh okay," she shot me a nervous smile and I walked down the stairs and searched for Zayn. He wasn't on the couch or even anywhere near it.
Where could he possibly be? He can't just leave me like that.
Everyone was starting to gather in a circle around something. I walked toward the forming shape and in the center was Zayn and Harry. They were yelling at each other.
"You know she's not yours," Harry growled. He looks super pissed.
"Well, I don't see you going after her at all," Zayn smirked.
"Why are you being an asshole all the sudden?"
"At least I'm not one to her,"
"Shut up," Harry screamed, but Zayn kept taunting him with words that he didn't want to hear, "Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
"Chill out Harry,"
"How can I fucking chill when all you're doing is dangling her above my head? You know I like her,"
"She seems to like me more. After all, who's the one she hung out with tonight?"
Wait.. It all clicked.
Were they talking about.. me?
