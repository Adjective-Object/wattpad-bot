"Frida I'm honestly sorry about this morning OK I love you so much but you probleble think I'm and idiot for keeping all your tracks " I told frida  she was asleep in my room in my arms.
"I think I'm falling for you" I heard frida say in her sleep
I pulled the cover over us and wrapped her in my arms.
I truly love you Frida
3am
I woke up in the middle of the night to frida crying in her sleep almost screaming
I watched her , not like the freaky way , but to  see if she would cry or scream again.
"Ahhhhh" frida  screamed
" Frida wake up baby " I said shaking frida
She sat up breathing heavily
"Hayes , he's dead he died because of me" frida cried
"Frida  its OK baby , who did " I askedTrying to calm her down
" he died " she said to herself
" baby look at me !!" I screamed at her
She looked at Me scared , like if I was going to hurt her
"Go to sleep we'll talk about it in the morning OK " I told her as she calmed down and slowly start to drift asleep
**Frida's povI woke up and hayes wasn't in bed.
I think I'm crazy I'm all lovey dove with some guy I just meet a few days ago.
I got out of his room and walked into mine .
I grabbed some clothes and took a shower.
I played 'hey mama' by Nicki Minaj.
I washed my body with mint soap and my hair with apple scented hair shampoo .
I wrapped a towel around me and put on some sweats and a tshirt . I tied my shoulder length brown hair into a pony tail.
I walked out and down stairs
" Hayes " I screamed
No one answerd. I walked to the kitchen and saw a note on the fridge
