RING! The school bell at Nova High School goes. "Crap!" I whisper-yell as I start to run. My foot slips and I fall flat on my face. "Hey! Are you ok?" A girl asks me with a voice of concern. "Yeah I just tripped." I pick up my books that are scattered across the hallway. "Your the new girl right?" She asks. "Yeah I'm Natalie Foster." "I'm Jamie Williams. I think we are in the same class," she says "Where are you headed?" "I'm going to math." "That's where I'm headed too! After I finish University, I'm going to be a mathematician!" Her voice rang with happiness and pride. I walk with her to math class, and when we get there I feel very awkward.
As we walk in everyone stares at us, their beady little eyes digging into my skin. "Girls, you are late!" The teacher stomps his foot. "I was in the washroom, remember? I asked you." Jamie says"Oh right. Carry on Ms. Williams." he turns to me "As for you, Ms. Foster, as punishment for being late you have to speak about yourself in front of the class." Oh no. I wish that he had said anything but that! I am terrible at speaking in front of people! "Well come on Ms. Foster, any time now" my teacher grows impatient. "I-I um, am Natalie Foster, I'm 16 years old and I um like to draw and design clothes." I wasn't telling them everything. I'm actually supposed to be 36 years old. I was experimented on and now I age slower than a normal human. They trained me to be a fighter. Now I have over 30 years of combat experience. I sit down in my seat and try to listen but my eyes close and I drift off.
