Jacleen's POV:I close my laptop and lay down, with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. 'Who is this guy and, is he really going to my school?' I thought. As I was laying on my bed, staring at my wall, my sister barges in out of nowhere."RAPUNZEL!" Yells Daniella, one of my sisters."Ugh, what?!" I yell back. She observes me, with her blue, supposedly perfect, 20/20 vision, eyes."Mom says go to bed, now, go to bed!" She harshly says. Of course, this was no task at all, my favorite thing to do, actually.I shut my lights off and faked snored, as a message to her that means "Get the hell out of my room".
Another day as a freshman, typical. I brushed my long, reddish, blondish, can be strawberry blonde, hair into a French braid, blah. I wore my black, ripped, skinny jeans and Nirvana tee, blah. I ate my breakfast, blah. And that is how I will describe my morning, blah, blah, blah!
So at my school, everything was the usual, as always. "Hey!" I heard, as a cheerful girl skips toward me. This girl, this human life-form with blonde pigtails and a kitty sweater, is my best friend, Jessica."Hi..." I say, not as enthusiastic as she always is."So.... Have you heard about the new exchange student?!" She says in a perky voice, with a squeal."He has been asking to meet a person with the IMing username..." Her voice trailed off.Behind her, was Satan! Just kidding, but she has the soul of the devil. This person was Isabella Mary-Jane Tubman. "Hi!" She said in a fake voice, trying to mock Jessica. She was wearing overalls and a tank (since they don't allow skimpy outfits) with her curls down."Umm... Hi..." I reply, trying to escape the conversation."Why you so glum, bum?" She continues, making a crooked smile. I could see the fire in her eyes, with me drowning in the flames."What do you want?" Says Jessica, seeming determined."Oh nothing, I just wanted to talk with my besties!" She squeals, hugging as tightly around the ribs. I manage to escape her grasp and speed walk myself to my locker. But, this wasn't enough for her.She comes toward my direction and bangs her fist in my locker."What's the matter, dipshit, scared?" She giggles, menacingly."Well, when you don't have a lot of money and can't buy yourself into a school, you have to work hard..." I replied.Soon, her fists fall off my locker. She begins to fake cry, hoping someone would notice the situation.As she does this, I saw a boy come out of the door, looking over in my direction. A boy who has never been here before."Uh oh" I whisper.
