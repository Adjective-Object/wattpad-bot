I woke up and rubbed my eyes taking in the scene around me Kylie was on my chest sound asleep and I just laid there for a while and played with her hair then I slowly and easily slid her off me and threw on some pants and a shirt I smiled slightly and looked over at Kylie who had taken up the whole bed then I turned and tiptoed quietly out the room and grabbed my keys and walked out to my car and drove off I pulled in bojangles and ordered me and Kylie breakfast and also got my mom something just in case jazzy and jaxon were with their dad he's not mine so I just got us breakfast then drove to a place I knew all to well I pulled in and stopped at the gate and it buzzed and the gates opened .I pulled up and parked my car by a black BMW X5.

.......................................Kylie POV I woke up smiling and felt for muscular arms and found none and sighed knowing he had once left me again to run off to a unknown place and was doing who knows what what if he's with Selena what if hes sleeping with her what if right now she's slowly remove her clothes and he's slowly forgetting me as she begins to remove his I tried to shake this feeling but I couldnt maybe it was a sign.. he could be cheating and I wouldn't know cause he leaves me in my sleep and he's gone by morning I'm stupid he wouldn't cheat on me would he maybe that's why he couldn't tell me what unfinished business he had with her .I shook it off and stripped of my clothes and hopped in the shower letting the warm water run off my body slowly as the stinging in my wrist began to take toll the cuts were fresh from last night and no its not the first time I have done it I know you don't strike me as depressed but in a way it takes the pain away only a few people know most people who have caught me or seen my scabs I cleaned my body and dabbed my cuts with the washcloth I'm not the type to flant it I cut deep enough to cause pain not enough to scar or bleed but it still stings I know it shows weakness and but I am strong I see it as battle wounds it heals over time and got out I dried off and I vowed to never do it again from this point on . I walked into Justin's room in a towel and grabbed one of his shirts and some basketball shorts then put my hair up in a bun .I turned on the TV to the walking dead and make some popcorn and stuffed my face with it as I saw rick come across the screen; gun in hand and he shot at a nearby walker then another then the walkers started to appear so Rick went back in the prison to find glen and alert the group that walkers were surrounding the camp as I got into it I felt two strong arms wrap around me and pull me closer I smiled and continued watching my show he kissed my cheek and rested his chin in my neck he grabbed my popcorn and set it in front of me then grabbed my wrist and I winced at the pain it shot up my arm I tried to hide the pain but Justin noticed and tried to roll up my sleeve but I tried to jerked my hand away and he didn't let me as he rolled it up and gasped at my cuts I could feel his glare so I turned my head but I could still feel it as instead of freaking out he kissed it then rolled the sleeve back down .
" how long " he asked almost in a whisper
" four months " I sighed
" these were they from yesterday " he sighed looking at my wrist I nodded and pain feeled his eyes I knew he felt bad about it I grabbed his chin and kissed him softly
" don't worry about it I'm happy now than I have ever been " I kisses him once more " I love you" I added
