I've been getting some views on my story, and I'd like to say, thanks you guys for reading and you've been such an encouragement and I just love writing Harry Potter fanfictions. I don't want to get cheesy here, so I'm going straight into my new game.
It's called the Guessing Game. One of the main plots of my story is Domino's quest to find her real name, and I think this could be fun if I turned it into a game. So, here is how you play (only participate if you're going to be a good sport):
- Before each chapter, I'll put a little note that tells you if the chapter will be part of the Guessing Game. During some part of the chapter, I'll mention something about Domino's father that may or may not give you a hint of to who he is. When you see this sentence/paragraph, comment on the chapter (it doesn't have to be right on the paragraph) and tell me who you think it is.
- ONLY SOME CHAPTERS WILL BE PART OF THE GAME
- I will check your comment, and if I think you have a possible answer, I will either comment on one of your stories or message you the word "MAYBE".
- Yes, I do know who I plan for her father to be, so I won't change the story just because your answer is good.
- IF YOU DO RECEIVE A MAYBE, DO NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT. I DONT WANT TO SPOIL THE STORY FOR ANYONE.
Thanks for listening, guys, and I hope that you can find this a fun little addition to my story. <3
