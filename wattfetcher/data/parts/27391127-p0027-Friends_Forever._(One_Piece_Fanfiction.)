"What happened?"
"I have a good guess."
"Me too."

Twilight's POV.

I quietly walk down the long narrow hallway that leads to my room.

My room. More like my fortress of soltidude. My room where I currently live is in the West Wing. But the orginal bedroom that my parents gave me is in the Northern Wing, The wing that is strictly forbidden to the rest of the family.

I slowly walk to this room and fall on my comfortable bed that I haven't been on since three years ago.

I look at the ceiling, I clearly remember those words.

"Hey, Millie-nee-san, do you wanna build a snowman?"

I closed my eyes and I felt the warm tears tickle my face. I haven't seen my siblings for 10 years and I expected them to act like nothing happened.

Of course, it wouldn't be that easy, it's never that easy.

"Millie-nee, please come out. Everyone's asking where you've been."

More tears streamed down her face. The first thing she's going to do as soon as she becomes Queen.

*knock* *knock* *knock*

I instantly snapped out of my thoughts and dried my tears. I shakily walked towards the door and swung it open.

There, I saw Aya in her coronation clothes.

"You look pretty." I complimented smiling a bit.

"You're not dressed and you look like you've been crying." Aya said putting tme to sit on the bed. What's up?"

"Nothing much."

"Liar." Aya teased with a poker face.

I looked at her with surprise and then I looked at the floor, swinging my legs like a little child, my bangs covering my eyes.

"What's going on with you and your siblings?"
"Nothing."
"That' a lie." Aya  replied, being very straight forward.

I looked at her curiously. "There's something going and I believe it has something to do with your devil fruit."

I looked down again. I couldn't. I couldn't hold them back anymore.

That's when I started to cry. Like a downpour or Juvia from Fairy Tail.
