Standing in her room was Scott McCall, Stiles Stilinski, Malia Hale, Lydia Martin, Liam Dunbar, and last but not least Derek Hale. She was blown away; she almost fainted. "Am I in a dream", Anna asked. "No Scott", replied. Anna had many questions, but she couldn't get any of them to come out of her mouth. Anna finally asked what they were doing at her house. They told her she needed their help. She said, "what kind of help can some actors give me?" They all laughed. Malia said, We're not actors.
Anna thought her head was going to explode. She thought someone was playing a trick on her, a cruel practical joke. Anna finally realized the serious looks on everyone's face. She sat on her bed and giggled. She could not believe it her favorite fictional characters were in her house saying that they are not fictional.
Scott finally explained the whole show of Teen Wolf. He said that the stories were real that all of that happened in real life. That everyone was what their character was. He even showed Anna his red eyes. This time she did faint. When she started to wake up she had familiar faces watching yet they were like strangers. Anna asked for an explanation for the surprise visit. Lydia explained. She said that they didn't live in Beacon Hills that they lived in Anna's town, Cerny. Also she said that Scott might have accidentally bitten Anna. Scott ended the silence with a welcome to my pack speech. Anna was in denial; she did not want to believe that this was happening. Anna had always dreamed of werewolves being real, but know that it actually is true she really regrets that wish.
"So, now what!?" Anna yelled at the ceiling.
