"LET'S DO SOMETHING CRAZY" Simon's eyes sparkled,"I aint kissing anybody" I laughed, "And why would I even want to kiss you?" His facial expressions said he was lying, "Is that really a question?"I raised an eyebrow, "Shut up, LET'S GO RO THE WATER GAMES" He jumped like a 3 years old kid, "Are you crazy ? It's 9 and it cold" I glared at him, "Dah! That's why it's crazy", "LET'S GO" I raced him to the water games but thanks to his maybe 2727feet long legs and my long skirt, he won.
"SIMON", "What?" He looked at me, "I want girls' hair" and Simon burst in laughter, "I'm serious ! It's tasety" and he laughed even more, "Eat your own hair", "No I mean this" I pointed at what I wanted and he exploaded in laughter, "This is called Cotton candy" He said rapidly, "In Jordan we call it girls' hair", "Seriously? Are you like: please give me some girls' hair?", "Yes" I chuckled, "OKAY,  whatever makes you happy and fat" Then he bought me 'Cotton candy' The laughs we laughed were uncountable.
"Go before they see you" I shooed Simon away from the house, "That's what I get for letting you have fun?", "No, that's what you get for letting me play water games at night" I squeezed my skirt and splashed some water on him, Simon laughed, "No goodbye kiss?" He smiled and I slapped his face,"Always ruining the moment" I sighed and got into the house while Simon's laugh woke up most of the neighborhood.
I sneaked in slowly like a thief "Where were you?" Damon asked and Elina was sitting beside her mother facing the TV, I'm not used to lie so,"In the park", "With who ?" Damon leaned to the wall, "A friend of mine, it's none of your business anyway" I opened the fridge to get something to eat, "It's my job to watch you and make sure you're Okay. And what the hell did you do this morning?" He seemed angry, what's wrong with this guy ? "LISTEN TO ME Habibi,  I don't need you to take care of me because Simon is doing it perfectly" What did I just say .... "Simon ha? It's all about Simon right?" He asked, "I don't even have to explain a thing" I took my bag and headed to my room, Damon's grip tightened around my shoulder and he skinned me around, "You better stay away from Simon", "Oh please ? Take your hands off me", "Anything wrong honey ?" His mother asked, "No Ma'm, sorry I'm late" I smiled.
.....
"Simon" I called but he didn't hear me with all the girls blocking him, welcome to the daily life of Simon. Few seconds later they went off to their classes, "Hey, Simon" He turned his face and it was fully recovered, "Oh! I see you got your pretty face back" I chuckled, "Now I can see you with two eyes, even better !" I laughed, "Stop, now listen! Come to my house at 3:30 Okay?" I smiled, "Why?", "Just come, I need your help, and bring a huge knife, I need one" Fear was all over his face, "Relax, I'm not going to kill you, you're my friend now".
I had my math exam then went back home after I bought something, "What is that disgusting smell?" Elina asked as she walked down the stairs and froze when she saw me holding a rope with a sheep at the end of it, "Oh my god! Mom is going to kill you", "Come on ! I haven't eaten meat for months" I patted my sheep's head, "D - do you mean you're going to eat this?" Elina stared at me, "I'm not killing anything this time ! It was a chicken last time, now A SHEEP !!!" Damon freaked out, "Don't need your help, already called Simon" Damon's face turned red, then the doorbell rang and Damon's girlfriend showed up, "Hi everybod- What is that?" She stared at me and my still - Un - cooked meal, "My food" I smiled then Mrs.Carter came, "THIS THING HAS TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW" She blew my eardrums up, "Fine, fine just calm down, Majanin!" I sighed, "What does Majanin mean ?" Damon asked, "Crazy" I whispered so his mother doesn't hear me.
Someone pressed the doorbell button, SIMON ! "Hey everybody" He smiled, "What's that?" He asked with his hand covering his nose, it smelled kind of stinky, "Come on people ! Haven't you seen a sheep before ?" I mumbled. "You all with soft hearts stay, Simon, Come with me tough guy", "Right away sir" He pulled out the knife I asked him to get.
