"Sanji-kun!" Sakura yelled .
"AH SAKURA-CHWAN! HOW CAN I HELP YOU TODAY!"
"Can I have some meat please?" Sakura asked.
"How any would you like my dear?"
"Enough to feed an army!"
"Right away, Sakura dear!"

~In the Straw Hat's living room.

"Luffy, I brought your meat!" Sakura yelled, holding a giant platter with meat stacked ontop it.
"EH! Than you Saki-chan!"
"You bastard, don't use women to get what you want!" Sanji yelled, kicking Luffy.

"Why the hell am I here?" Law asked regardless of the situation.
"To play a game" Luffy said casually.
-_-" --> "Had a feeling." Law and Haruka responded sweatdropping.

"The truth is that Luffy heard about some game." Nami started.
"Its called Truth or Dare!" Luffy answered with an innocent face.
"And you know Luffy and his stubbornness." Usopp continued.
"It's very terrible."
"Anyways, he decided that it'd be more fun if others were there."
"I've waited a whole week."
"But when Traffy-kun said he wouldn't come." Robin started.
"Luffy didn't eat breakfast and lunch." Sanji continued.
"So it was your fault." Aya said firmly punching Law as she remembered when Luffy came to her complaining about a bellyache.
"That's when we decided to kidnap you." Chopper finished.
"Then I was happy! Let's play this game already"

They sat in a circle in this order: Luffy, Sakura, Nami, Usopp. (the giant plate of meat was behind them), Zoro, Sanji, Haruka,Law, Chopper, Aya, Brook, Franky and finally, Robin.

"So how does the game work?"Luffy ask.
"DON'T INVITE US TO A GAME YOU HAVE NO FLIPPING IDEA ON HOW TO PLAY IT!"
"Well, we ask a person Truth or Dare."
"Okay! Saki-chan, Truth or Dare!"
"Dare."
"Then you give them a dare to do."
"Saki-chan, I dare you to eat meat!" Luffy exclaimed.In one second, Sakura transformed into a dragon and ate all the meat.
"That's not what I meant!"
"Too bad."

"My turn! Haruka, I dare to go in that room!" Usopp exclaimed pointing to the 'safe' rooom whose blue door was closed.
"Piece of cake." Haruka answered, cracking his knuckles. He entered the room and closed the door behind him.

Sakura and Usopp began giggling and they locked the door.
