"Once you upon a time there was a place. This place was Earth, but it was different. A war once broke out people now a days have been isolated from it so much that it has been forgotten"."Almost forgotten!""That's right, Almost forgotten. Anyways, the war concluded and neither side had won. The first party made an agreement with the second party to end the war on a certain set of conditions.""What conditions?""They gave up something very precious in order to end the war because they had run low on reasources. The first party had lost lives, ammunition, food, and water supply had gone down, and they lost the most important tool needed for battle... faith. They had lost all trust in one another and in what they believed in. They gave it up.""The war?""No something else.""What?""I"ll tell you, I'll tell you... in a moment. On with the story. A third party, an arbitrate, got involved. They were loyal to the first party and gave their oath. There was one problem though.""What, what?""The third party was also assisting the second party. The second party knew that the the third had earned the trust of the first so they used that. The third agreed to work with the second on a second set of conditions. Their terms were stating that the second had to share their newly earned power coming from the first. The third took control over the government and the more undercover work done were as the second took charge in divide and concur. Leaders of the second split up and separated the land in factions, each leader ruling one under the third's watchful eye. In the end with the first weak already and being turned on by their false ally they conceded and agreed to follow the rules of the second/third.""What were these rules? Are they the 'conditions' you were talking about earlier?" "Yes, they gave it up. What? you may ask. They gave up their only source of power. Their freedom"And that's where we are now.
