"You can't fight if you don't have energy. Now, drink." I told him, my arms crossed.
"A-Alright, then..." He said before gulping down his drink.
"Aah~ Woah! You're right, I do feel energised now!" He said. After that, he began attacking the monster with his skill.
After a few more attacks on the monster, they eventually won. The monster didn't disappear though, but it was slowed down.
"Quick, let's go to the room where Germany is." Japan said.
We all rushed towards the room. We went inside and closed the door. Safe. For now, that is.
"This is the fortress where Germany is." Japan said as he pointed at the iron door.
"It's pretty solid. Hey, West! Japan told me you were hungry. D'you want some mushrooms? Or food or something?" Prussia asked.
A low voice was heard from the other side of the iron door. "Is that you, Prussia?Are you all right!?"
"Yeah, I'm fine!But I have bad news! Italy is still missing! And we have to help a mochi." Prussia replied.
After that, a tall, burly man with blue eyes and blonde hair went out of the, er, closet? Whatever. I knew that that man was none other than Germany.
"Hmm. All right. I'm done here, so we can go now. But...bruder, who's the frau?" He said.
Once again, I waved nervously.
"Ah! West, this is _____!!.. ______, this is my younger bruder, Germany." Prussia said proudly.
"You're...locked up in here like us, huh?" He said sadly.
"Yeah...but I hope I can help as much as I can to get us out of here." I told him.
He then gave a smile. After that, he turned to Japan. "Can we come back here once in a while?" He asked.
Japan nodded. "I don't mind, but...Do you actually like those narrow spaces?"
"Well, you could say that I'm... used to them.There's a lot of room, though." Germany replied.
"I don't really get what we're supposed to do, but let's go to the fourth floor!" Prussia exclaimed.
Hence, all four of us headed for the fourth floor. It was reealllyy tiring. I wish I had a shift button here somewhere =.=
On our way up, Prussia remembered something.
"Ah! Before I forget, I really need to thank you, frau!" Prussia said as he placed a hand on my shoulder and gave me a bright smile.
"Huh? What for?" Germany asked.
"Well, you see West--when we were battling the Thing, she made us eat some food. At first, we thought we didn't need to, but it actually helped us quite a lot! Kesesesese!" Prussia explained.
"That's right. I express to you my gratitude, ____-chan. You really helped us there. But...how did you know that we needed it?" Japan asked.
Uh-oh.. I don't know if I could tell them the truth... Mhhm...
"W-Well..I didn't really want to just stand there and play the damsel in distress... So I observed you guys from afar and...calculated what you guys would be needing and stuff...." I told them.
"That's a good skill for a soldier." Germany said approvingly.
"Haha..t-thanks, I guess.." I said quietly.
