Mallory:In the rest of my classes, no River. After school, no River. He left school early.
I walked home with Corey and I went to check my text from River...biggest mistake ever.
From 💝River💝: hey babe...miss you already...so bored without you next to me😔
"Mallory, what the hell are you doing?!" Corey yelled and grabbed my phone to check my texts. "Are these all from River?!" He shouted. I slowly nodded and he grabbed my hair and pulled me home.
He pulled me into the kitchen and grabbed a bag of salt. Oh no. He dumped it on the floor and said, "Put your knees in." I didn't move.
"Mallory, are you deaf or something?! Get your fucking knees in or I swear I'll do it myself!" Corey shouted and I hesitantly kneeled into the salt.
I cried in pain. It stung so badly. I covered my face with my hands and cried into them.
After about 2 minutes of being in the pile of salt, Corey picked me up by the hair and pulled me upstairs. He threw me into my room and locked the door.
I leaned against the wall and grabbed my blade from under the bed. I put it to my wrist and slid it across. Another and another until I had 3 cuts total.
I put the blade back and limped to the bathroom and cleaned my cuts. I limped out and saw my phone on the bedside. I saw I had a text from River.
From 💝River💝: sorry Mallory...we can't be friends anymore...you're bad for my life...
To 💝River💝: River please...don't go back to how you were before...i would die if you did😔
From 💝River💝: then why don't you just die already...see you at school slut...not that I ever want to
I gasped and put my phone down. I sat down on my bed and cried. "Don't leave me River." I cried and got my blade out again. I put it to my other wrist and slid it across. This time, I didn't clean it. I let it gush out blood.
River:I looked out my window to see Mallory sit on her bed. She got out a blade and looked at it. She then put it on her wrist and cut herself.
I can't stop her. I can never stop her. I shed a tear as I looked at how she didn't go clean her wrist. That cut was the effect of me.
I wiped the tear away and stood up to turn off my light. After, I crawled under the sheets of my bed and cried myself to sleep.
