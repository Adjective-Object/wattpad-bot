I don't like life. Wait...no I actually HATE life. I suffer every day by myself and no one bothers to listen to what I am going through.
Every day, my friends, well, the few friends that I actually have, always said "come on Emily, stop being so glum", they didn't understand. No one did. Except for me. I was the only one that I could talk to. I know that sounds weird and all but it's the truth. There was no better listener than myself.
