*A/N- Okay, so before I begin, I would just like to say that I do not mean to offend anyone by this post. It came purely from my mind, and it is my opinion on this topic. I am sorry if I do offend anyone, however, we all have our own opinions on this. Also, for the people who actually read this thing, *Warning* this comes from the point of view of the aborted child, and it also has many mentions of sex and such. Read at your own risk... Enjoy!*
Before I was born, you already had my fate decided
I was to die, cold and alone, until my life subsided
You think it's fair to kill someone that is barely even alive
Well I'll tell you, that for once, don't have such a fucking high sex drive
Get him to wear a condom, if you don't want me inside of you
Cause I'll tell you abortion will destroy you
Put yourself on the pill, take a morning after
Don't lay down, don't have a frown, get up, move a little faster
If you don't want me, then don't have sex
You can go and masturbate just like the rest
Cause I'm tired of having to die
Because you got pregnant and wanted to cry
I'm tired of being this mistake
Next time I won't even bother, for fucks sake
Get him rapped in plastic, go get yourself a nuva ring
Because I swear if you don't, I'll become your baby, and not just a disposable thing
