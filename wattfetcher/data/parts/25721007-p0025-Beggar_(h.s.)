"Yet, you let Brock do those terrible things to me?" I sighed. My mind is all over the place right now.
"I'm so sorry Lennon. If I could take it back, I would," he truthfully says.
"I need time Harry. My feelings are all over the place right now. Please go away," I, sort of, demand.
I want him to stay with me right now, to be completely honest, but I can't give into him like that. I'm not that type of girl.
---
It's been a week since I've last seen or talked to Harry last. He's been respecting my space that I need and I really appreciate that. Though, today, I'm ready to talk to him again.
I've been hanging with Eleanor more this past week. We've talked lots about Harry. She believes he truly does love me and I should give him a chance, but it's still up to me in the end.
As I step through the door, Zayn immediately greets me, "Happy birthday Lennon!"
"Shit, how'd you know?" I shake my head. It's sweet of him though.
"Eleanor told me," he shrugs and I smile.
"Well, thank you Zayn," I say and walk past him.
"Wait," he stops me and I turn back around, "I have something for you."
He hands me a box that's covered in baby blue wrapping paper. Zayn got me a gift, for my birthday. I haven't celebrated or gotten anything for years. This is the sweetest thing someone has done for me in a long while.
"Zayn.." I trail off.
"It's nothing really," he shrugs it off, "Just open it."
"Okay," I simply say and begin to unwrap the gift. Underneath the paper is a Nikon d5300, he shouldn't have.
"Zayn, this is the sweetest damn thing someone has done for me in years. I haven't received anything on my birthday for a long while. I don't know what to say really," I say and happy tears begin to run down my face.
"Well, I remembered you said about wanting to be a photographer and wanting attend college next year, so I've decided to help,"
"It's too much. Thank you," I hug him and wipe my tears.
Zayn looks behind me and glares. To my luck, Harry is staring right at us with angry eyes. Oh no.
Heyy everyone! Hope y'all enjoyed. A short and sweet chapter. But Yeahh..
Vote!
