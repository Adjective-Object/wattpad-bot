Hi, I'm Dark_Music01. Rainbow Dash is one of my friends. You may ask her some questions, ask her for advice or even compliment her. And she might be to overconfident...

Rainbow Dash : Overconfident? Pfft... Yeah, right. Blackhearted Curves is the one who is overconfident! Anyways, I'm Rainbow Dash. My friends call me Dashie. I'm the soccer captain. Lightning Dust is trying to take that away from me. Just please don't ask me math or science stuff. I'm not the egg head here. Twilight is. No offense, Twi.

Twilight : No offense taken, Rainbow. What your saying is true anyways. So, did anyone asked you yet?

Rainbow Dash : Nope, not yet. Imma go shut down this laptop of mine.

SHUTS DOWN
