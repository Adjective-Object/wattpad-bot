Sebastian stoped in front of me and looked away from Claude's cold glare.
"Yes. She works for the Phantomhive manor." Sebastian took my hand. "We're just leaving."
I glanced towards Claude and gave him a questioning look.
Sebastian dragged me away from him, and into the ballroom.
I shoved his hand away. "What the hell was that?"
Sebastian had a grim look on his face as he looked away from me. "Stay away from the servants here. They're far too dangerous."
I cocked my head to the side and narrowed me eyes at the butler.
"And you aren't?"
He finally looked at me.
"You knew?"
I rolled my eyes.
"Tch. You revealed it to me several times."
Black hair fell into Sebastian's face as he chuckled softly.
He regained his posture and held out his gloved hand. "Your hand, malady."
I took his hand, and he let me to Ciel.
Shortly after, we left the masquerade.
-Time-Skip----------
Back at the manor, I was in my nightgown and about to climb into bed. A soft knock was on the door. I sighed and opened it. Sebastian stood there.
"What do you want?"
"How would you know that I'm a demon?"
I gave him a serious expression, took a deep breath, and stared into his ruby eyes.
"My friend told me."
"Who's your friend?" Sebastian asked.
I gave a devilish smirk.
"The spider."
---------------------------------Boom! Mind blown.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna make this a love triangle... unless you want me too... OR NOT!
Thanks for reading!
