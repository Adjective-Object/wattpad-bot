I already have a chapter about her but I have to write another this girl is just too amazing lmao. Shes like my mummy she keeps me safe and hug me and give me kisses on the cheek and on my forehead haha. She gives me lectures all the time she's always like don't have sex until your married‚ date a good guy‚ put your phone down and study lmao and these lectures I always listen and do them not only because she's my mom (lol) but because there right and I just love how displine‚ sweet and adorable she is haha. So today I was staying back with her after our exams I stayed back with her to wait on her taxi to get her and then i'd go home and I lay on her lap while she was showing some pics of her husband lol and then she showed me some really weird random pics she have of me and I was like delete them now lol but she was like noooo there cute and I was like laughing because of how dumb I looked in them all and she kept them lmaooo. Mick is like the most jealous person in the hot damn universe haha even though I get jealous too but hot damn shes ten times worster than me!!!!!!haha like today this dude hugged me and she was like noooo u can't hug her shes mine and grabbed me away and the dude was like geez okay haha and you have this quote that says "you and your best friend don't act gay  then your not close enough" and all i can say is if the kids didn't know we were best friends then they would think we're lesbians haha. I remember when we both find out we liked the same guy haha we were like nooooooooooo!!!!!!!! And then within that same week we both just stopped liking him which i like really sweet cause when I asked why she stopped  she said cause your more important than some boy and then I was like Omg sameee haha. She's been there with me through everything and she really spoils me like she ties mt shoe lace for me and order my lunch for me and does like a whole lot of other stuffs and I spoil her too like alottttttt if she ever needs something im always there to go get it and whenever she gets sick I turn into the mummy and help her with everything and she tells me when we get old we're gonna be like crazy grandma's who are always laughing hahahaha which I think its true I doubt we'll ever grow up. I love you to the moon and back......
