Alright, here we go :D. Time forÂ a new rant! On SMILEYS!!!
Do you know what is wrong with that block of text up above? Besides my obvious abuse of the poor Caps Lock button, of course. Of course you don't, cause I'm about to tell you.
That. Freaking. Smiley.
Ladies and Gentlemen, meet Jessica the happy face.
:D : HI!!!
Me: Go away, Jessica. No one likes you.
:D : :(.....
Me: You know why I hate this little demon child? Because she's taken over the minds of several authors on this site!
I want you to count on one hand how many times you've seen text talk or emoticons in the middle of a story.
I bet you you can't, can you? That's because there's SO MANY!
I'll tell you what's wrong with this. Firstly, it's distracting. Secondly, it's lazy. Just like people who don't know what a spell check is. It makes me want to slap the author every time I freaking see Jessica invading the story.
:D : HEY!!
Me: Learn the functions of the caps lock, people. And stop using emoticons. And together *points gun at Jessica's stupid face* we can rid this website of the virus that is Jessica The Smiley Face.
*shoots Jessica*
FIN.
