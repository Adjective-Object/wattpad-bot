Hello everyone,
I know its been awhile since I've last updated and I know I said before that updates would be slow.  This time they may be coming slower.  I might even be putting my books on hold since I will be super busy with AP Psychology, AP Language, Human Anatomy, and other activities.  I'm sorry.  It sucks for both you and me.  I love to write and post my writings for everyone to enjoy.  It sucks for yall because it was just getting to the good part about Jaycie and the gang.  Also when I do post you may be getting more of the others pov.  If you want a specific person, just tell me.  You can message me, comment or write on my profile.  Comment, vote, and continue to be awesome :)!
