Jacob's POV :
Bella whent into labour but Carslile wasn't here so Rosalie gave Edward the injection for Bella to feel numb "We have to wait until the medicine kicks in." Edward said nervously."GET IT OUT!" Bella yelled. Rosilie cut Bella's stomic with a hospital knife I got nervous then I jumped on Rosalie before she did anything stupid. Then I got Rosalie out of the room. I went back in to see him holding a baby in his arms."Will you take the baby?" I refused "I don't want the thing who killed Bella ever!" I yelled at him then I started to get Bella's heart going again. It was no use she's dead thanks to that stupid blood sucking leach! I went to the room Rosalie had took baby Renesmee our eyes met and I kneeled. I cant believe I just inprinted on her.
