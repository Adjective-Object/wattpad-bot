The room is cold.
Its quiet.
Its dark.
My hands are still tied up.
And there is a clothe in my mouth, tied tightly around my head.
My face feels stiff from all my tears and I feel a sharp pain of the side of my head.
I slowly open my eyes, the empty room dimly lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. I start to panic and look around.
Step
Step
Step
Step
My heart rate quicken and a person appears from one of the corners of the room.
He's tall. Lanky and his hair is greasy. He's about 20 years old and his eyes are a light green. He looks at me with disgust in his eyes and I feel mine fill with tears.
"It's nice to finally meet you Shea" he says with a smug grin. "Yes I know your name" He says as he walks closer. I panic as he does.
"Relax Im not gonna hurt you... Yet" he says with a loud evil laugh. "So Shea you know Ashley right?" He asks with a smug grin. "Thats my little sister. And since you fucked her over. Me and her though why not fuck you over too"
