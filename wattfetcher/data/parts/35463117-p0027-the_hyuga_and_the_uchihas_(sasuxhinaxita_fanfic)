(Okay before the fight I just wanna say,
WhoohooÂ 4 chapters at once! This is because my mother had taken the service on my phone and I forgot the password so I couldn't update on a computer, but I could still write so I have a lot of updates for my books. All of em except "my heaven: a naruto fantasy, my heaven: a naruto fantasy- 3 years later, and my heaven: a naruto fantasy- 3 years later-a new problem" because they are complete. *dramatic applause* I am proud to say that I think my mom was mostly bluffing about kicking me out. But idk anymore. Nor do I care. Ehem, anyway if you don't know him I most definitely recemend "naver too late" which is a sasrnaru/narusasu and itakyuu fan fiction. It is a currently 3 book series in one book. The account name is thepervysage and I also recemend "forever young" which is a kakasaku fan fiction. Lastly I must tell you, FOLLOW THEPERVYSAGE! HE IS SO FUCKING HILARIOUS YOU WILL MOST LIKELY PISS YOURSELF OUT OF LAUGHTER I AM DEAD SERIOUS! SO FOLLOW HIM OR FACE SEBASTIAN'S WRATH!
sebastian: fear me and my sexy neko.
Me: mewow bitches!)
