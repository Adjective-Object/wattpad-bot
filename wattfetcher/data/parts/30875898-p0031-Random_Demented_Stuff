She took another step and looked at the ground
Her voice was caught in her throat, she couldn't make a sound
Even if she pleaded, no one would help her out
Even if she pleaded, everyone just put her down
It was a war, she felt so right but they told her it was wrong
In the back of everyone's mind, they knew she wouldn't last long
They knew she was gonna loose her valence and slip
They knew that it was the last time they'd ever see her blood drip
Looking at the concrete, she formed her last words
They escaped her lips, "Goodbye to this unfair, cruel, cruel world."
She didn't look back at the people she might miss
She just blows her bullies a goodbye kiss
She jumps, landing head first
But the shock on her tormentor's face looked much much worse
