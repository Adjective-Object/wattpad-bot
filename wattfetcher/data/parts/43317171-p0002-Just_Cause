"Yep,  Physical Therapy" I smiled, proud of my choice.
"Well..." he pulled out a folder, and handed me a pamphlet from  the inside. "I supposed that you would be interested in this convention that's going to be in town." He went back to his computer, and waited for me to read the pamphlet.
And here I am. Soon to be president of Mu Alpha Theta, treasurer of SGA, and all other positions like that; being asked to attend a nerdy science convention. So obviously, my first thought is no. Hell no, in fact.
But a part of me brings it out of me to say "Yes, I would love to" which is instantly a punch back in the face.
So, in the next two weeks, I have to find a way to get out of this "Super fun experience for our future leaders and healthcare workers!". Or, as the pamphlet reads.
Just another day of my boring life.Â Woo. Woo. Woo.
