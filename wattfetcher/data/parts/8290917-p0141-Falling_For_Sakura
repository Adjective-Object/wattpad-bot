He cocked his head to one side. He wasn't surprised that she never thought of herself beautiful. No, she was a beauty all right-both on the inside and out. And she was the woman he was in love with.
Without further ado, he clicked the shutter button.
"Darce!" she shrieked.
He laughed and continued clicking. Click! Click! Click! Click!
Sakura reached out to get her camera, but Darcy only laughed. Then when she wasn't prepared, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her so damn passionately and wildly that Sakura had to cling onto him for dear life. What Sakura didn't know was that Darcy was taking photos of them kissing, with the camera in his hand extended out at a good distance.
When he moved his head back, he stroked her cheek with his thumb, his eyes glowing with love as he gazed at her. She didn't know it, but Sakura herself was gazing at him, her eyes large.
Click! Click! Click! The camera continued to record.
Then she laughed. Sakura never thought she could be this happy with Darce-her dear Darce. Then suddenly her happiness was snatched away from her as she realized this couldn't be. This couldn't last. The reason? Because Darcy was her adopted brother. Because Alaina was his twin, and she would never ever accept this.
Oh, God! She didn't want to hurt herself any more than she'd already been hurt. Even more so, she didn't want to hurt Darcy. She never ever wanted to hurt him.
She cleared her throat and said, "I think we should be getting back now."
He smiled sadly. "Yes," he said.
Sakura turned and headed toward the road. Darcy watched her go, a sad expression on his face. Quickly he opened the camera, took out the memory stick, and shoved it into the pocket of his jeans.
"Are you coming?" She turned back to look at him.
Darcy looked up. "Yeah," he said and rushed up to her. He took her hand in his and led her back home.
