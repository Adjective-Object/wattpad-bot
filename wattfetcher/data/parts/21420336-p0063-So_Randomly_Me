Guys, I don't get why authors put requirements on updating books...
I mean, yah I get frustrated when 20 people read a chapter and like two votes
(THANK YOU PEOPLE WHO TAKE TWO SECONDS TO PRESS THE FRIGGIN STAR BUTTON)
ANYWAYS,
it is just like
I make books to get people to laugh, because lots of the people here on wattpad are the people who come to escape from their own horrible realities, and I respect that. Thus, I am not going to put requirements on my book because
1) It makes me look like a snob
2) My book isn't even that good so why make it sound that way
3) WHAT IS THE USE OF VOTES I WOULD RATHER HAVE COMMENTS SO I CAN SPEAK TO YOU GUYS
4) You Â know how annoyed I get when people say
"OMG 5OO VOTES FOR ONE CHAPTER IM SO PROUD NOW LETS JUST GET TO 5000 BY TOMORROW YEAH? WE CAN DO THIS!"
Im like
"First off, you ain't doing nothing, nada, so don't say we. Second, I DON'T EVEN HAVE 5000 VOTES FOR A WHOLE BOOK."
5) It honestly just makes people mad and it makes you mad when you do not get your goal
In fact everytime someone gives high ass requirements
I DONT VOTE
I do not care if your book is the best, I like modest people ._.
Btw guys, this is my opinion which is why the title is
"So Randomly ME."
Which means, this is me, I can say what I want because YOLO
If you take this to offense
I dont seem to find the fucks i give, try again tomorrow XD IM KIDDING I CARE
