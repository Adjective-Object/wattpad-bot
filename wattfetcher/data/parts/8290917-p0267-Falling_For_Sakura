It wasn't long after that when Mr. Tachibana and Ms. Ruka went on their merry way again, with their intended mission accomplished.
"He blackmailed us with Sakura," Hayden said sourly. "The bastard."
Tristan laughed. "Well, he's resourceful, that's for sure."
Logan said, "I hope Sakura isn't going to flip when she found out we're to be her co-models."
Tristan leaned back and smiled. He said, "I heard there's bedroom scene. I hope I'd be paired with Sakura for that. I like bedroom scene."
Conrad scowled at his brother and said, "That's not going to happen. Maybe Nicolas will get the bedroom scene with Akira. He's the oldest, and Akira is the most experience model."
"Maybe I'll talk to Mr. Tachibana about it," Tristan said.
"Not if I got there first, bro," Logan put in, and the brothers laughed.
