I don't really know what's going on. I have too many things to do, no one to talk to, and not a lot of time. It's frustrating. I'm so stressed out in breaking out in hives and I feel like I'm going to vomit. I just need to yell at something or someone. I'm not even sure that will help. Ugh. Fuck my life.
