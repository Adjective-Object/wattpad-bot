I walked around the neighborhood after therapy. The air cooled me down, it was too hot in the room I was in for 30 minutes. The lady there started to ask all these personal questions and I felt like I was cornered animal.
I hate that feeling...
I thought as I walked in random directions. This was probably not my brightest idea, it's a bad habit of mine.
"Hey, look who it is!" A high pitched voice yelled out behind me.
Just my luck!
I turn around to see the one and only, Amanda. She had a smug smile on her face, her blonde hair looked all devilish.
"What do you want?" I asked her impatiently, wanting to continue my walk. She glared at me as she Motioned her 'friends' over.
"She wants to know what we want." She told her friends. They laughed was as high pitched as her voice.
"I just want you to know what we know about you..." She replied as she walked closer, her friends forming a circle around me.
"You are worthless." She told me before she shoved me to the ground, another continued after her.
"Ugly, unloved, a brat..." Another kick or a slap.
"Uncared for, a burden, hated, waste of space..."
A different voice went on, but I could only feel the pain. I can't think with them beating me. It's one thing to think it, but it's worse to hear it from others, it breaks me into nothing. One voice I heard out of all else.
"You should kill yourself, no one will miss you." Amanda's voice told me as the beating stops. She continued on,
"You'll be doing a favor for all of us." I ran home as fast as I could, tears running down my face. I am a mess....
