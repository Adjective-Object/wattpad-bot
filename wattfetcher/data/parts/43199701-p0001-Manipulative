Before we start off our lovely story, a few notes are going to be given to you on this story. Almost all characters in this story are based off of real people. Yet, most of the events occurring in the story have never exactly happened. And there is homosexuality, so if you're homophobic, I suggest you stop reading here. But then again, #LoveWins. Also, there is going to be a lot of... feelsy parts. And to the people I don't portray just right in the story [Y'know who you are], I apologize for that inconvenience. I love you all, and thank you to those who plan on reading this tale!! ♡♡
