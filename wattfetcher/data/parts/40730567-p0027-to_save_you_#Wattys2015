Jake had rushed to Abrielle's house with Mandy on his side. The message had scared him. He didn't want to lose her. But he couldn't help but think, what if it was too late? When he parked his car, his heart was beating wildly. The door to the house was open, and there were several people banging on Abrielle's door.
"Abrielle, open up." He commanded, knocking at the door. When he grew impatient, he pushed at the door, forcing it to open. Everything grew silent right before Mandy's ear piercing scream was heard. Jake's knees gave away and he fell on the floor, too shocked to say anything.
