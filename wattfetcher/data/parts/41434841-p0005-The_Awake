Jesus I've written a lot today.The awake is a strange name y'know. But idk what else to call it. Honestly I just kind of want to write everything down but that'd take too long. I feel like I should probably talk to Jordan but I said a week. Plus I've been doing well on my own and I don't want to mess it up. Who knows. Maybe I'll end up showing this to him or something. I need to get out more. I should probably go for a run or workout. I need to get in shape anyways. My chubby self won't look so hot in a spandex guard uniform.
Oh well.
I think I could get used to being awake.
