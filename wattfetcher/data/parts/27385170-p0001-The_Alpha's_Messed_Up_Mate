WARNING: NOT EDITED!

.....Tick.....Tick.....Tick....Tick
I watch the seconds ticked by in the clock as I wanted in agony for the time to come. When the time came I would get revenge and nothing would stand in my way. My name is Elizabeth Carter and I will the one to end the life of the royal family along with my brother of course. I had a reason for doing such a action that could leave be died on the ground in a pool of blood and it was a good one. When I was little my mother left my brother, me, and my father to go with another man. She left us and went to her new family as the man already had too children. She tried to contact us, but by that time any love I had for her turned into red boiled hatred.
I wanted revenge for what she did to us how could she just leave us like that we were her family. That b*tch, but then again i shouldn't have been surprise given what type of person she is. Over the years me and my brother have trained for this moment. 9:00 couldn't have arrived faster at this exact moment the ceremony should be commencing.I quickly pack all my weapons into a bag headed out. We quickly go into the trucks and were rolling. As we were reaching the castle that houses the royals I think of everything from my mother leaving us to me heading towards the castle ready to kill the royals and the alphas in attendance.
We finally arrived and as I stepped out i looked towards my future and thought maybe if I finally kill my mother I can be at peace, but if not so be it after all she had it long coming. After all she should know..........KARMA IS A B*TCH.
