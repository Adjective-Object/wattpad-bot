Ugh  I don't remember the bench by the oak tree in the park then I ran to the bench and found the note taped to it
I'm sorry if your tired look behide you - justin
I turned around   and no one was there  but there was a box    so I opened it and it was a picture of justin  smiling and there was a note
Come to my house  you will find me there - justin
I smiled and walked to his house which wasn't two minutes away not even a minute really
I walked up to the door and knocked and his mom opened the door
"He's in the back yard " she smiled
" thanks "   I smiled walking into the backyard
Then saw another note and picked it up
Turn around
- justin
Then I turned around and found justin staring at me with tux on and I smiled
" Hey how did you like my little  goose chase" he asked
" I loved it " I said pecking him on the lips
" good I put a lot of work into it " he said leading me over to a blanket on the ground  and
sitting down and pulling me to join him
Then his mom  brought out a picnic basket   and walked back in the house
" this is perfect " I said pecking him on the cheek
" thanks " he said handing me a plate  with  a sandwich and fruit on it
" thank you .thank you" I said happly
" I know you like sandwichs and fruit wait till you see what I have for dessert  "  he said taking a bite of his sandwich
" cant wait " I said taking a bite of my sandwich
"    yeah "  he said
" is it raining ". I said. Looking up confused then looking back at justin who's eyes got wide then started  picking things up as it started pouring down  I helped him by handing him things and picking things up and running for his house
"  justin run "I said looking to see if he was following me  then he ran up beside me and we darted for the door and tapped on the glass door
" Pattie " I yellded  tapping on the glass
" mom" justin yelled tapping on the glass to with his free hand
Then Pattie came running downstairs and ran to the glass doors and let us in
" sorry guys I was upstairs  " Pattie said   trying not to laugh
" its fine " I said shivering cause now my dress was wet ... Great
