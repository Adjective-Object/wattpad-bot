The bus finally arrived at Wrightwood High School. The school is really big to be near a small neighborhood. It was built a few years ago and it looks like it's still new in the city. The school colors are red and blue. Therefore, the inside is plastered with red and blue stripes and lockers.
I got up from my seat and followed the crowd of high schoolers to the exit of the bus. Once I got out, I went inside to the hall of lockers. I searched around to find my locker, even though I come here everyday. While I was looking for it, I ran into my two best friends, Alex and Max.
Alexandria, AKA Alex, has beautiful green eyes with curly brunette hair. She has dimples and a few freckles. Her personality is like mine, but she has a really girly side.
Maxine, AKA Max, has amazingly colored eyes. Her eyes are a mixture of blue and green, but a bit more blue. She has solid black hair and a clear face. She's sometimes outgoing, but then she has those days.
"Hey, Charlie!" Alex exclaimed.
"Charlie, darling!" Max screamed in her dumb British accent.
"Cut it out, Max." Alex punched her arm.
"Ow! Fine. But wasn't it good?" Max asked.
"Nah." I admitted.
"Whatever." Max responded.
"Dude! Your outfit! Did you pick it out?" Alex asked.
"Obviously. You like?" I questioned.
"No. Love it." Alex replied.
"I love it, too, but the pants and hat are overrated." Max said. She always tells the truth because she says it's for the "greater good."
"The pants weren't on purpose, but the hat. It's obviously the best part." I explained.
"Not really." Max admitted.
"Don't listen to her." Alex spoke up. "We all know how she is."
"Yeah, we do." said a voice behind Alex and Max. They turned around and found our friend, Jesse.
"Hey, Jesse." I waved.
"Sup, Charlotte?" Jesse waved backa and came at my side. He put his arm around my shoulder.
"It's Charlie." I reminded him as I pushed his arm away from my shoulder.
"So... Jesse... Why did you come here?" Alex asked.
"I just wanted to see a few of my friends." Jesse answered while staring at me. He quickly looked away and found Max giving him a death glare.
"Ok. That's great. Now leave." Max said fiercely.
"Fine. Bye, tomboys." Jesse waved and walked away.
"Bye." Alex waved back. She quickly turned back to me. "He clearly likes you."
"No, he doesn't." I said.
"Yes, he does. Why else would a guy come around and put their arm around your shoulder?" Max informed.
"I don't know..." I shrugged.
"And he was staring at you. A lot." Alex added.
"I'm pretty sure he was looking at something in my hair." I replied.
"No, there isn't! All there is on your head is that hat! And he was staring at your face! Jesse likes you, Charlie." Alex concluded.
"I refuse to accept that. Why would an athlete fall for a tomboy?" I asked.
"I don't know. There must be something about you that he likes." Max said.
