Above the world, the earth, the sky, the trees, the horizon There resides an eternal darkness, strewn with infinite lights To us they are little beacons Little beacons of hope, promise, fate and destiny
They stare, watch with nonexistent eyes, glimmering with shimmering Ideas of which to involve us, you and I, my darling Plotting, not planning, our next moves, our decisions, which we so stupidly Believe to be of our own choice
Over a year now they have observed us, our deceit, our brilliant game A beautiful play written by ear by us, we, my darling Where two lovers battle constantly the cruel antagonist of reality Of the defiance of social convention, of judgment most foul Yet, we have evaded the stars and their awful ways Winding around the troubles in our path Leaping hand in hand into our desire for one another, damning to never Look back, to glimpse and smirk at those whom behold us In the typical dark light
Contained we are, yet boundless the emotions, the need The craving I myself find in yearning for you But, when our evasions are consequentially stopped, you will always look to me Right at me with those grey, amber lined eyes, a haze of sorrow veiling them Your light pink lips upturned in a suppressed delight, cursing them Hating them, despising the stars that made everything impossible Then the words come from your lips, so perfect they seem, so cruel Pale ashen skin framing them as you inhale, your cheeks deflate from the excess oxygen As you pull the words from memory, your beautiful voice cutting their air, You speak, "Damn the stars! Stars!" Unable to display my true abhorrence for such lovely, difficult creatures Aimlessly decorating the universe, I return the gesture of your mouth Joining me to you briefly, perhaps touching your jaw Murmuring back, "Forget the stars." For if we forget them, for a moment or a second, perhaps they forget us Perhaps they will gaze elsewhere in the eternal blackness, another earth Where two forbidden lovers, a boy and a girl, stare at their sky before back to their love's eyes Smiles of faux tolerance on their expressions, exchanged words of scorn Leaving us, my darling, to indulge in one another, embrace As we, so eloquently put, Damn the stars.
