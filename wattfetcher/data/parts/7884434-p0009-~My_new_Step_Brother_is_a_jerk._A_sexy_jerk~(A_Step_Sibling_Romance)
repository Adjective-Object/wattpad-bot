"I'm Lisa. Seths little sister" She said with a smile. 'And now your soon to be step sister!" She said happily! She ran up to me and wrapped her arms around my waist. "Seth was right you are beautiful!" My heart sunk in my chest. He called me beautiful?
"Its nice to meet you Lisa!" I said kiising the top of her head. She giggled and then let go of me.
"LISA! WHERE ARE YOU?" I heared Seth call.
"I'm in Shea's room!" She called back. I heared him walk towards my room and he stopped in the doorway. He looked over at me and he frowned. He then looked over at Lisa and a smile spread across his face.
"Come on silly goose, lets go get some ice cream" Seth said walking over to Lisa and picking her up.
She whispered something in Seths ear and he went red. He was blushing?! Oh my god.
Lisa giggled and he shook his head yes.
"Hey Shea?" Lisa began.
"Yeah?"
"Seth said you can come get ice cream with us if you want" She said with a smile. I looked over at Seth. He looked uncomfortable.
"Lisa I can't sorry. I have to finish unpacking. Maybe some other time okay?"
"Oh Okay." She said with a frown.
'Oh c'mon Shea, you can unpack later" Seth said suddenly.
"Uh no, Some other time I promise!"
"Okay. But you promised so you have to come next time!" Lisa said with a smile.
"Okay I will!" I said with a laugh.
Seth had not taken his eyes off of me. I was starting to feel self cautious under his gaze. "Hey Lisa can you give me and Shea a minute?" He asked his siter sweetly.
"Sure big bro but hurry your pants! My tummy needs its fuel!" Me and Seth broke out in laughter. Lisa left and me and Seth stood there in an awkward silence.
"I want to apologize" He said braking the silence. "I shouldn't have done that i'm sorry" He confesed.
"Its alright. I was kinda rude too. I feel bad for saying that. I really don't know if it was a mistake. A part of me liked it. But it can never happen again" I said and he shook his head yes.
"Can I just ask for one more favor? After it I won't try anything else I promise" He said walking towards me and resting his hands on my hips.
"What would that favor be?" I asked looking into his eletric blue eyes.
"Can I kiss you?" He asked looking into my eyes.
"Wha- Why?" I asked
"I don't know, but since I saw you the other day I have wanted to so bad" His eyes flickered to my lips and then back up to my eyes.
"Just one?" I asked him
"Yes. Just one. Unless ou want more?" He said witha smug grin.
"One thats it" I said sternly.
"Okay!" He said with a chuckle.
His face became more serious as he looked into my eyes. His where so full of emotion. To much for me to read. His hand left my hip and made its way to my cheek. He caressed my cheek softly with his thumb. His other hand rested on my waist rubbing the skin under my shirt gently. I closed my eyes taking in the feeling of his fingers on my skin. This was crazy! Why did I freaking agree to this? Before I could stop him his lips pressed against mine softly. My stomach filled with butterlies, my knees weak. Why in the living hell did he have this affect on me?
