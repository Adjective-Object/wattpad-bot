BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!
Went my alarm to begin senior year!!! I turned my alarm off and got into the shower.I picked out a dress that was lacy at the top and floral at the bottom with a brown belt around the waist and cowgirl boots.I curled my hair and did my makeup.I got a text that my best friend Mckayla was almost at my house so I grabbed my book bag and an apple.Mckayla pulled into my driveway and I got in.
"Uhh I missed you so much your parents suck for not letting you stay here you know me and my mom would of let you stay at our house."
"Mckayla I know I asked they said no but I met someone at my aunts..."
"Omg who what's his name??"I told Mckayla everything even why I left early.She stayed silent for a couple minutes.
"He's stupid if he had told you at the beginning do you think you guys would still be together?"
"I think so I don't care that he had a kid but the fact that he never told me."I said and Mckayla nodded.We made it to the high school and uhh it took forever to find a parking spot.We walked in together.
"Hey my sexy best friends."said Drake my guy best friend.
"Hey loser."I said giving Drake a hug.He's on the football team
"You know your crush Jake? Well him and Melissa broke up.And you'll never guess who he wants to date next?"Drake is best friends with Jake who is also on the football team.
"Cindy?"asked mckayla
"Miranda?"I asked
"Nope he wants to date you, mickey." said Drake with a big smile
"What?!?Nooo why now when I just got out of a relationship."Drake gave me a questionable look so Mckayla told him about Cole.The name still makes my heart flutter.
"Sounds like a douche bag."said Drake
"No he was an okay guy besides hiding that he had a kid."
"I don't know Jake just texted me and said he wants to take you on a date and ask you out.He said he'll be here in a couple minutes."said Drake slipping his phone in his back pocket.
"That is my sign to leave.Bye love y'all."I said giving Drake and Mckayla hugs.I had trig first thing in the morning uhh.I've also heard my teacher sucks, Ms.Boggs.We were going over a worksheet and I wasn't paying attention and ms. boggs calls on me.
"Mickey are you paying attention?"asked my teacher
"Sorry what was the question?"I asked.
"Get out if your not listening go sit in the hallway."So I pushes my chair back and sat out in the hallway.
"Hey mickey..."said Jake.
