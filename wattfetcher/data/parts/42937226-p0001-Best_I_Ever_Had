Sierra's POV
"Justinnn" I giggled looking at my best friend taking 5,000 pictures of himself on my phone.
"Sierraaa" he mocked me making funny faces.
"You always do this! And who is supposed to delete all of your stupid selfies? Oh yeah, me!" I scolded as he chuckled.
A knock on the tour bus door broke us from making him face my wrath. The same one I have almost everyday.
"Justy! Open the door!" I rolled my eyes. I could recognize that annoying voice anywhere. Hailey. Also known as Justin's girlfriend. Justin got up, throwing me my phone with a smirk.
"Have fun." He winked at me.
"I hate you." I glared at him while he was checking himself out in the mirror.
"Of course you do, how do I look?" He questioned.
"Horrible. Now open the door. I don't need your bratty girlfriend accusing me of shit anymore." I rolled my eyes.
"Hush up." He said opening the door. "Baby!" He cheered pecking her lips. I mentally barfed at how annoying they are.
"I missed you, Justy!" She whined. Looking around her eyes landed on me. Her face turned cold. "Well isn't it the ugly mistress."
"Hello STD magnet. How are you doin on this fine Saturday?" I asked her. I loved getting under her skin.
"Perfectly well, thank you. Wait-" I cut her off by laughing hysterically. Justin just looked at me amusingly trying not to laugh. My best friend everybody.
"I'll leave you two fuck buddy's alone. Whorely, try not to give my best friend a deadly disease. Peace!" I shouted throwing up a peace sign getting off the bus. I could hear her yelling at him about how he never defends her. Why would he? He's my best friend. He always told me that no girl he's with can over rule me. I smirked whipping my hair to the side.
"Sierra!" I heard someone call me.
"Yo! Who you be doe!" I called back. I heard someone running to catch up.
"Ry Dogs in the house baby!" Ryan yelled.
"What house? We're outside smarty."
"Whatever. I came to tell you, we're invited to a masquerade! And I need you to be my date. So what you say?"
"I say yes, to go to the ball. I'll go with you but not as your date. I'm already taken by my food." I shot him down with a cheeky grin. Ryan was another one of my best friends, but not as close as Justin.
"I knew you would say that. You always shoot me down for the food." He poured jokingly.
"Stop being annoying boo boo cakes. What time do I need to be by your side my dear prince ugly?"
"By 8, and the color scheme is red and black. So don't be the idiot you are and come out in a pair of black tights and a purple hoodie with Justin's shoes like last time." I rolled my eyes at him.
"I'll try not to! Bye bye!" I kissed his cheek and ran back to the tour bus. I opened the door to see Justin alone.
"Where's your STD magnet?" I furrowed my brows.
