bonnie laughed at the girl at her porch, claudia, teasingly. she knew claudia was crushing hard on her, and honestly, why wouldn't she be? bonnie was beautiful, funny, smart, and charming. claudia had come over to watch movies, and bonnie didn't know how she thought that bonnie would spend time with her.
the girls only knew each other through mutual friends, and had hung out a few times in groups. claudia was sweet, and a bit snarky, although not snarky enough to be bonnie's type. she had long, frizzy hair, and gray eyes, the same color of the sky outside. a storm must have been coming, bonnie noticed.
the slightly shorter girl looked at claudia and stated quietly, "why should i let you in?"
claudia looked at her, taken aback, and replied with a shaky, "because we are friends?"
bonnie scoffed, grabbed the bag of cool ranch chips from claudia's fingers, and slammed the door on her.
bonnie's caramel eyes took up much of her slightly chubby face, and they saw claudia looking very confused, with wet trails down her face. bonnie grumbled something about claudia being on her porch, and opened the door a crack.
claudia's hopeful look disappeared at the harsh words that left her crush, bonnie's mouth.
"go home, i don't like you, and quite frankly it is very annoying to have a crying girl on my porch,"
with that, claudia turned towards her car. once she got in, the rain started drizzling, beating on the top of the hunk of metal. bonnie gave a vicious wave, and claudia drove off.
