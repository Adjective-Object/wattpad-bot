So this is twilight related..... 50 shades of gray is pretty much about a wealthy business man who suduces his newest employee they have sex and they fall in love yadda yadda yadda kinda cheesy but it's like number 1 on the market. People love it their not judging it making fun of it so they shouldn't do that to Twilight at least it's not written and directed porn Minus the less than to minutes in the movie and no description in the book.........DONT JUDGE ME!!!
WHO AGREES WITH ME AS FAR AS ALL THE OTHER TWILIGHT STATEMENTS IVE MADE PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU DO I COULD REALLY USE IT
