She then drank all of the water in one gulp and laid back down on the couch.
"What did you even have to drink last night?"
"Punch." She mumbled. "Someone spiked it."
"Kids were drinking that!" I yelled.
She covered her ears and whined.
"Sorry... But for gods sake, kids were drinking that. Oh my god, Clara drank it..."
"Don't worry about her. She realized it was spiked the second it was in her mouth and before she could drink any. The second it was in her mouth she spit it out. She also made sure kids weren't drinking it."
"And she let you drink it?"
"Well yeah. I was stressed."
"Why were you stressed?"
She groaned and pulled the pillow over her face.
I pulled it away from her and stared her in the eyes.
"Melanie, why were you stressed?"
"It might rain at the wedding, and I don't want everyone to get wet, because then they'll get irritable and-"
"Why don't you just get a tent then?"
"They're expensive, and I don't have enough money for one."
"Mel, you do know I have money right?"
She grabbed the other pillow and threw it at me.
"What was that for?!"
"You're not wasting your money on a wedding! It's just like an oversized party!"
I laughed. "Melanie, it wouldn't be wasting any money. You know why?"
She tilted her head slightly and looked at me confused. "Why?"
"Because I have a shit-ton of it."
"No you don't."
"Want to bet?"
"I don't have anything to bet..."
"The winner gets to... uh... hmm... if I win you have to sleep shirtless tonight."
"What?! Paul!"
"Yup, that's what I get if I win. Now what do you want?"
"Fuck you." She mumbled.
"You'll be doing that soon enough."
"Nuh uh. I'm never having sex. Remember?"
I laughed. "Okay, okay. Now what do you want if you win?"
"I want to go to Warped Tour next year if I win."
"Do I get to come with?"
"No."
I pouted.
"I was kidding Jesus Christ."
"My name isn't Jesus. It's Paul."
She rolled her eyes at me.
"Is that a deal?"
"Deal."
We shook hands and then I pulled her with me to the office.
I found our banking account papers. (a/n; idk if that's a thingbut this is the future so fucking deal with it.)
I flipped to the page I was looking for and pointed to the amount of money on it.
