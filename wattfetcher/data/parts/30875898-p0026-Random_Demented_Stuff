A/N- So I made a song the other day, it's not very good, but I decided to pay it anyway. Hope you enjoy, bye!
My Last Words by Shy Valentine (ME!!!!)
Chorus-
Hey you little beauty, no need to cry over my mess
Hey you little cutie, we both tried our best
But suicide won and now I'm dead
And when you think about my last, this is what I said
Verse 1-
It's okay, there's no need to be afraid
The droplets of crimson water doesn't make me crazed
I'm still a human, I still have a beating heart
It might be broken, but it can go so far
(Chorus)
Verse 2-
Walk around the broken mirror
Don't mind all of the scars
In a couple of minutes, I'll be long gone
I'll be somewhere unearthly, either heaven or hell
But without my razors, I think I'll do too well
Don't try to change my mind, I'm dead set on this
I won't go to another place that I don't fit in
So I'll see you later in hell, baby this is it
(Chorus)
A/N- Like I said, not the best. Oh well, whatever...
