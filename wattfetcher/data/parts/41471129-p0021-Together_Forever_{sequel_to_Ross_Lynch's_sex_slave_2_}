Jordyn - Mom, I'm going to a party
Ariana - Oh no your not
Jordyn - Fine then
Madison - Mom I can't find my phone!!, OMG!, omg!. Jake could be calling me!.
Ariana - I think you left it in your room
Madison - Of course I did, jeez, why didn't I think of that?
Riley - MOMMY!!
Ariana - Yes Riley?
Riley - Jordyn told me to go fuck myself
Ariana - Jordyn what did I say about you swearing at your sister?!!
Jordyn - Sorry!!
The kids are running up and down all around the house for some reason, I dont know why
Madison - Mom?
Ariana - Whaaaat??
Madison - Were you cooking something?

Jordyn - Can I sleep over at Kelly's house?

After she left, Ross walked up to me and wrapped his arms around my waist pulling me into him
Ross - Hey there
Ariana - Hi
Ross - You OK?
Ariana - I'm fine. I just love you guys so much
Ross - I love you too
And then we kissed
Riley - Aww, Daddy loves mommy

She walked up to us and Ross picked her up
Riley - I love you mommy and daddy
Ross - And we'll always love you too Riley
Ariana - We'll always be together
Ross - Forever
