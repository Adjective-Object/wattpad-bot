Jungkook suddenly came towards me
with a smile.
"Annyeong."He said with a smile.
I gave him a shy smile but suddenly my heart started pumping really fast.
What's this feeling? When I usually meet my other biases in other groups I don't have this kind of feeling too....
It kinda started getting awkward so I turned to V.
"V, I'll get going now."I said with a smile.
"Goodbye, everyone."I bowed.
"Guys are we already done?"V asked.
"Yeah, I guess so..."J-hope said.
"Then, I'll go home with you."V said.
"Wait.....What about the clothes I just gave you?"I asked.
"Oh, these....We have a early dismissal today so..lets get going."
"Yah! V...!"I whined.
He held my wrist then we left the room.
Jungkook's POV
When V and kei left I smirked.
"V, seriously likes his own sister?"I muttered.
"Kei, is kinda cute we should tell V to bring her here sometimes."Jin said.
Yeah we should.......but....she looks somehow like.....Jiyeon-ah..
