He stood there with a blank expression on his face. I walked out to my car and got in. I turned it on and sat there. I rested my head on the steering wheel and took a deep breath. I lifted my head and began to back up. Visiting my dad always helps.
I drove up to my dads grave. I got out and walked over and sat infront of the stone.
"Hey Dad, so things have been pretty hectic lately. My freaking soon to be Step Brother won't keep his hands off of me. Weird right? I mean he doesn't stop kissing me! Don't worry dad I told him to stop. So I miss you. Like a lot. I know that if you were here we would be dancing just like always. I miss that. Dancing with you. If I was sad, you would turn on the house radio and make me dance with you. It always made me smile. I guess I never really thank you for all those times you made me smile. I wish you still could. Its har-hard dad" The lump in my throat blocking my words. "I guess I just need you because mom is never there... at all. And now that she is marrying this man she never has time for me. You always made time for me tho. You always made sure I was happy. Why you had to leave is a mystery. I always ask god why he took you away from me. I need you. I really do dad" I began to cry and put my head in my hands letting tears soak my hands. I looked up at the sky and looked at the clear blue sky. "I love you dad. So freaking much. I know you wouldn't want me to cry but I think about you and all our good times and thats all that comes out. Its my way of coping. Just remember dad I will always come here and visit you. Its my only way of visiting you. I know your spirit isn't there but your body and bones are. If thats the closet thing to you I will do it. I miss you dad. I'll be back soon. I love you so much!" I blew a kiss at his stone and got up. I wipped the tears from my face and began walking back to my car. I got in and broke down crying. Every emotion I have been experiencing coming out all at once.
~Knock~
I lifted my head and looked over seening a very good looking kid my age. I instantly felt embaresed and whiped the tears. I rolled down my window and smiled at the boy.
"Hey why is a pretty girl like yourself cring?" He asked with a small smile.
"Just um visiting my dad. Remembering old memories" I stated sadly.
"Thats understandable. I'm Casper" He said holding out his hand to me. I grabbed it and shook it.
"I'm Shea" I said with a smile
"Beautiful name for a beautiful girl" He said making me blush.
"Thanks" I said smiling.
"What school do you go to? I haven't seen you around"
"I will be going to Shore Ville High School. I just moved here with my mom. We moved in with her new boyfriend, his son, and daughter. His son actually goes to Shore Ville"
"Oh who is he?"
"Seth Morbin"
"Seth? Thats my best friend! So your his new Step Sister. He told me all about you!" He said smiling
"Oh he did?"
"Yeah. He was right you are definitly something to look at" Oh great another Seth.
"Look its bad enough Seth is all over me. I don't need another him" I said harshly
"Woah, he may be my bestfriend but I am definitly not him! Do I seem like him?" He asked
"I guess not. You definitly a lot nicer and you haven't tried to kiss me or put your hands down my pants!" I said with a smile
