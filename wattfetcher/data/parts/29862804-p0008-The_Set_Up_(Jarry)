" 3 words and 9 letters . " I said playfully ( 3 words means I have food and 9 letters means the letters of the 3 words )
" Okay coming I won't be late . " I laughed then we hanged up . I made some food for Niall . After a short while Niall was here . The door knocked and I opened for Niall I hugged him .
" Okay where's the food ? " Niall said sitting down on the sofa .
" Choose a movie first . " I went to the kitchen bringing the food to Niall .
" What about a horror movie ? " He suggested , I love horror movies alot ; I used to watch them when I was a little I always loved to know what's going to happen in the film that's why I watched them alot.
" Okay choose a good one . " I put the food infront of him , he chose saw movie . It wasn't bad but the things that happens in the movie freaks me out . I made some popcorn and went back to Niall .I gave him a bowl and I brought a blanket for the two of us .
" That's going to be really cool Jadey . " He said excitement .
" Yeah . " I smiled . We watched the movie and ate then Niall brought the note book movie I love that movie alot . After a whil my mum came but me and Niall were sleeping ; my head was on his shoulder and his head on mine , mum took a picture of us .
She left us sleeping both of us woke up because Niall's phone was ringing . It was Simon .Niall left my place and went to meet Simon and the boys , mum showed me the picture of me and Niall sleeping she said we looked very cute .
I checked my twitter ; I followed some fans and answered few messages . One ofthem asked me if me and Harry are dating but I told her no we're just friends then I closed the phone I took a shower then Perrie called me .
" Hey Jadey . " Perrie said happily .
" How are you ? " I asked choosing a pyjama from my closet .
" I'm fine , Jadey come to my house want to tell you alot of things that happenedtoday . "
" Okay I'm coming . " I chose my outfit and took my bag I told mum that I'm going to Perrie's house .I arrived at her house ; I knocked on her door and she opened . I entered and Perrie gave me some mango juice .
" So what happened today ? " I said taking a sip from my juice .
" Zayn asked me to marry him . " Perrie said happily , I hugged her tight .
" I'm so happy for you Pezza . " I couldn't stop smiling I'm so happy .
" Thank you so much Jadey hope to see one day as a bride . " She smiled and I did too .
" There's alot of pictures of you and Harry and some pictures fans made , you're so cute together. " Perrie said turning the tv on .
" We hang out alot but we're just friends Perrie nothing more . " Me and Harry are friends why people don't get it . It started to annoy me . I left Perrie's house heading to my home . My manager called me and he said I have to see him tomorrow because there's something important is going to happen .
