///Third Person PoV///


"You take care of that one! We'll take care of these two!"


"Japan! Are you all right?!"

"I'll take care of it while you do the chanting!"

Meanwhile, back in the current time loop, the other countries were engaged in a vigorous battle against numerous alien-like creatures in the room that had bloody numbers written on the floor.


"It's really tough...My sword can barely cut it!" France panted.


Prussia looked at his two friends and spoke aloud, "Let's go all three at the same time! Drei, zwei, eins-"


"Cero!!" Spain shouted as the three of them charged after the rock-like monster in front of them. After critically hitting the creature, they were able to defeat it.



On the other hand, Romano and Japan were battling against a flying alien creature in the top right corner of the room. "Jump, Japan! I'll distract it for you!" Romano yelled.


"Thank you!!" Japan said, jumping up into the air.


Romano grabbed the monster's attention by shouting out, "C'mon, you bastard, your trophy is over here! "


When the creature started to move closer to to the Southern Italian, Japan appeared and attacked the monster from above, successfully defeating it.


"...Arrivederci." Romano smirked as the creature disappeared.



Japan walked over to his comrade and smiled. "Well done, Romano!"


"... Yes! Get down, China!" England called out as he prepared his magic attack against the monster in the bottom right corner of the room.


China nodded and warned him, "Aiyah! Don't miss, or else!"


"Hah! You fucking tell me! Take that! Sectumsempra!!" England smirked as he used his magic to critically hit the monster and leading it to its end.
