"I didn't want to forgive you....I wanted to hate you.....but I love you." Love was the word the almost made me crash into a light pole...he loved me.... My life wasn't full of shit after all.
"You made my day ten times better" I saw him blushing. The cute son of a gun.
"Good to know" he laughed a little nervous. "My house is here." I turned in the drive way of a two story house it was white. "Great no ones home."
Me and dylan got out the car and followed him in. This house was insane! Sweet mother of Christ he must be rich.
Chris kissed me out of now where. "Take a picture It will last longer" he said making me shiver. "Later" he said in my ear.
"Just so you know I'm top" I said when dylan was out of earshot. Chris chuckled.
Maybe karma was a myth? Then I heard that voice.
Dark forest is rising. You will be on the side of light. This is where you will awaken. Your mate on the side of darkness......one will die....one will live..but in the end the wolves will reign supreme.
