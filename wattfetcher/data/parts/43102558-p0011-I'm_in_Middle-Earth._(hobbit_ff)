We stopped at a huge boulder. The camp was set up. I laid beside Thorin as he slept. I watch him sleep peacefully. I looked at Fili. He was talking to Kili. Are you alright Michelle? A voice popped in my head.
Who is speaking to me? I asked.
Blake. Haley can do the same thing. She is listening to our conversion right now. Gandalf said that all three of us have the same gift. You might have another one. Haley and I want to know what's wrong. Blake thought to me.
I'm in love with both Thorin and Fili. I don't know who to choose. I know that I have to choose one to save in the future. Haley will have to save Kili. I don't know what to do.
It's ok. You might be able to choose when the time comes. Haley's voice rang in my head.
Thanks. Please stay out of my head unless I want to talk to you without being heard. I requested.
Ok. Haley and Blake replied in unison.
I laid my head on Thorin's chest to listen to his heartbeat. Thorin wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me closer to him. I blushed madly. An unfamiliar sound filled the air causing me to sit up. Fear ran through me.
"What was that?" I asked gaining attention from the others.
"Orcs. Neck cutters." Fili started.
"They sneak into your camp at night and slit your throat while you sleep." Kili finished.
Thorin was up now. He noticed the fear in my eyes. Both of the brothers snickered at Bilbo's expression. I then remembered their future deaths. I shot up filled with anger. "Do you think a night raid from orcs is funny?!" I yelled.
"Sorry Michelle." Fili and Kili apologized.
"You should be. You know nothing of this world." Thorin added.
Thorin walked off and stared out into the forest. I walked over to him. I knew why he hated orcs so much.
"Don't mind him. Thorin has a good reason for hating orcs. It started at the battle for Moria. After Smaug took over Erebor, we hoped to reclaim Moria. We fought against the pale orc, Azog the defiler, and his army. It started with the death of King Thror. Azog cut off his head. Prince Thrain disappeared either driven mad by grief or captured. We do not know. Next was Thorin's brother.
"Thorin stood alone against the pale orc. With nothing but a sword and an oak branch for a shield, he fought Azog and chopped of his arm. The orcs took him away. The rest of us drove the orcs back into the depths of Moria. No song was sang that night for the numbers of deaths was too many. I knew then that there was one whom I could still call king." Balin explained.
"What happened to Azog?" Bilbo wondered.
"He died of an infection." Thorin guessed.
I slightly shook my head. Balin, Gandalf, and I knew the truth. Azog was still alive.
