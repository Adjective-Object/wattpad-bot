Ryouko Ookami is the Main heroine of this story. She's 16 years old and has a very intense personality, just like a wolf. She is 175 cm tall.

Ryouko acts like a tsundere towards the Host Club; In the beginning she has a mean attitude towards them but eventually begins to be kinder to the club as the story progresses.
Ryouko adores cute dogs and wolves. As in this story she only cares about other animals and she enjoys reading romance novels.
Appearance:

The soles of her boots have a wolf paw print on the bottom.
