"I didn't do it he did." Austin said.
"No, I really didn't."
"It's okay Aust, if it makes you feel any better Kellin spilled hot coffee all over me last night." I told him.
"And he took his shirt off and everything." Kellin said, "It was worth it."
"Oh nice." Alan said, "Get you some."
"Hell yeah."  He said, "It was hot as hell."
"Yeah well so was your coffee."
"Yeah but it was worth it in the end."
"Wait- Kells did you spill your coffee on me on purpose?" I asked him.
"Maybe a little but I wasn't trying to spill the whole thing."
"Really?" I asked while the two across from us just laughed, "You little shit."
"I give Kellin credit for that." Austin said laughing, "Way to go kid."
Kellin smiled, "What can I say? I'm a genius."
"This is why we're friends." Alan said.
I just laughed and shook my head.
Soon our food got there and we all started eating.
"So have you and Jonny talked everything out between you two?" Austin asked and I shook my head.
"Nope. I don't talk to him unless I have to and that's it."
"Makes sense."
"Of course it does. The guy's a dick."
"Tell me about it."
"Yeah the other day he pretty much ordered me to take his picture." Alan said rolling his eyes, "Why did you guys even have his band come on tour with you all?"
"I said no. In fact I threatened to start a riot." I told him.
"Because everyone loves the songs that he and Vic sing together and we didn't know who else to ask."
"They are plenty of other people to ask Aust." Alan said, "I mean what about Issues, they're great. Tyler and Michael are total babes."
"I suggested them but Austin said no and everyone else agreed." I told him.
"Why?"
"They were one of the only bands opened. Issues was going with someone else." He said. "Besides the guys in Pierce had concocted some scheme to get Vic and Jonny to get back together in hopes he'd dump the bitch."
I rolled my eyes, "There's a reason why there's only one Isles and Glaciers album."
"It wasn't even my idea to invite them."
"Yes but you agreed to it and I resent you for that." I said, "Besides you were trying to get me to hook up with him at the party but that doesn't matter I have someone a million times better than that dick now anyways." I said and put an arm around Kellin.
"Hey I was trying to get you to loosen up at that party. I didn't know you liked Kellin then so..."
"I didn't even know Kellin yet."
"See, so before there was no harm done."
"Whatever I'm still stuck touring with the asshole."
"You'll get through, just sing the one song with him and then ignore him. Make out with Kellin or something."
"It's two songs and the second one is so awkward to sing you don't even understand!" I groaned.
