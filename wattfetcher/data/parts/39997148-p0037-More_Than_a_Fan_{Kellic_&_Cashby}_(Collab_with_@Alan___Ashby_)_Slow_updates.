"So what did you guys do while we were gone?" I asked.
"We hung out with the other bands for a while then got bored and came back here and have been playing video games ever since." Mike said, "Speaking of video games- come play."
"Okay, but if you push me off the couch Michael Christopher I swear to god."
He smirked and handed me a controller once I sat down, "Just don't lose and I won't push you."
"You're on."
"Get ready to be pushed you little ass wipe."
"In your dreams."
"We'll see about that." He said and we started playing.
Ten minutes later, "In your face!" Mike yelled shoving me off of the couch.
"Fuck." I groaned from the floor. "What did I tell you about pushing me!" I yelled.
"I don't know but I won bitch!"
"Tony get in here! We're killing my brother!" I yelled getting off of the ground.
"No! Mike kill them all."
"He pushed you too you asshole!"
"I don't care!"
"You know what- next time Jaime puts his feet on you I'm not going to take up for you."
"Good."
"I hate you."
Finally after almost four hours we finally arrived  at the campfire.
Mike looked at Kellin, "Remember one beer for him and that's it."
"You got it." Kellin said. The guys all left to go get drunk and have fun. I turned to Kellin and gave him my sweetest smile.
"You know you don't have to babysit me. I promise I won't get too drunk." I told him.
"I promised the guys I'd watch you though."
"Yeah I know but I know you don't want to be here." I told him.
"That's true but I keep my promises so you're stuck with me."
I rolled my eyes, "Okay how about this then: I get to drink more than just a beer and you can watch me to make sure I don't do anything stupid."
He sighed, "Fine."
I grinned, "You're the best."
"I know, I know."
"Now come on let's go get something before all the good shit runs out!" I said and grabbed his hand dragging him with me to the drinks. "Do you want a drink?"
He shook his head, "No I better not."
"Come on Kellin! You need to loosen up. You're getting a drink- besides I make the best drinks."
"I guess I'll have one then I'm done."
"Whatever you say." I sang pouring us both something to drink and handed him a cup. "This will be fun."


Austin's Pov

I looked around the campfire at everyone drinking and having fun trying to find that familiar ginger that I knew was somewhere around here probably taking pictures.
"Where are you." I said to myself.
