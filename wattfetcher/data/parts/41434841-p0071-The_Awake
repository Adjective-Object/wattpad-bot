I need to be loved. Just. Not even romantically. I need to feel that I am loved. I can't just give everyone love and receive less than a fourth back. I almost hate saying "I love you" now because it's hardly ever honestly returned.
I just want to be loved. Goddamn it if I can't fucking love myself there has to someone out there that loves me. If not then I'm just kind of fucked for now, aren't I.
Yeah. Funny.
