I wake up to Shawn's arms around my waist.I try and wiggle out of his grip,but it's to tight."Let me go babe,"I say."Fine,"he says."Grier,"someone says.I look up to see Connor."Yeah,"I say."#askmiaandconnor,"he said."Do 'em later,"I say."Oh,"he says."Breakfast,"mom calls."Coming!"I scream(and shout and let it all out)."Shhh,"Shawn whines."Oops,"I whisper."Pancakes,bacon,and muffins!"Nash shouts.Literally when Nash said,"muffins,"Shawn ran down the stairs. I start running till I get to the stairs.Then I walk until I touch the cold foyer(hall)floor.I run to the kitchen but have to go through the family room(living room).I run through there but trip over Skylynn's toys."I got it on video,"someone says.I try getting up but my ankle hurts way too much."Mom my ankle hurts a lot!"I shout."Let me get everything situated and then I'll let Nash get you in the car,"mom says."Who's staying with Sky,"Justine asks."All the guys and girls except two,"mom says."Ava sorry Kenzi I really need to talk to her,"I say."Nash!"Mom shouts."Coming,"he says."Girls pick me out a cute outfit,"I say."Nash take your sister to the car,"mom commands.Nash picks me up and carries me outside to the car.He puts me in the back seat."Thanks,"I say."No problem,"he says.I buckle myself in and Ava comes out and buckles up next to me."I'm sorry I chose Johnson.Now I choose no one.They're all like brothers to me.Well Nash and Hayes are really my brothers,"I say."No I'm sorry.I over reacted,"Ava says.My mom drives us to the hospital."Ava will you please give me a piggyback ride?" I question."Sure get on,"she says.Ava stays sitting and I wrap my legs around her waist.She stands up and I almost hit my head on the top of the car.She runs into the doors of the hospital and sets me down in a wheelchair.I decide to text everyone.(😍-Shawn 🎶-Mia 👣-Nash ☕️-Connor 🙌🏻-Jc👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 🙅🏼-Kenzi 😎-Allie 💁🏼-Ava✌🏻-Heather 🏀-JJ 🎤-Gilinsky 😂-Taylor 😆-Hayes 👌🏻-Cam 🎎-Carter 📱-Gissel 📷-Jenna 💸-Aaron 😝-Kian 🎀-Kayla 🎵-Trevor 👸🏼-Justine 👄-Sam*Mia doesn't like Sam he's just dirty.* 🐲-Matt)🎶-Hi😍-Hi babe☕️-✋ Stop being all lovey dovey and shit👣-She may be your girlfriend but she's still my sister🏀-But they're a couple👸🏼-The most amazing couple💸-^^^🎵-Hi I was in the bathroom so I just started reading the texts👨‍👩‍👧‍👧-TMI😆-Trev OMG girl stop bringing your phone into the bathroom📷-I'm bored🚧🎶-I'm in a friggin hospital😡🎤-I'm sleepy😴🐲-Same Gilinsky"Mia Grier,"the doctor says.🎶-Just called my name.BAIII😂-BAIIIIO🎀-BAIIIIO(End of text messages)Ava starts pushing me to the weight scale.I stand up on my left foot only and the scale reads.'189'(A/N not even close to how much I weigh)."189,"the doctor said.Then I hop over to the height thing.The doctor pushed down the stick and read my height."5'9,"the doctor said.I grew an inch.I hop back to the wheelchair and sit in it and Ava starts pushing me to the room.We get to the room and I get out of the wheelchair and hop to the bed.A few minutes later my mom and the doctor walk in."Mia tell me what's wrong,"he says."I tripped over my little sister Skylynn's toys and hurt my ankle,"I say."Well I'll take your temperature,"he says.He sticks it under my tongue and let's it rest there.It starts beeping and he takes it out of my mouth."99.2," he states."Finger," he says.I put my finger in the little slot and it calculates many heart beat per minute."99,"he says.Then he finishes up."Mia your doctor will be in a few,"he tells me."Ava how are you and Johnson doing?" I ask."Great.How about you and Shawn?"she smiles."Still going strong,"I reply."Except that date the guy kissed you and Shawn only saw him kissing you,"she says."How'd you know?"I ask."Cam and Kenzi were both in the room,"she answers."Now that we're talking I realized that Kenzi and you are my best friends.The ones I can turn to.Connor and Cam are my best guy friends,"I say."I just recorded what you said and sent it to Kenzi,Cam,and Connor,"she says."Thanks,"I say."Hey Mia,"someone says.I look over to see Luke.Luke is married and has twins.He is also a great doctor.He has a daughter,Molly 16,and a son,Ross 16.Ross has had a huge crush on me since I met him when I was 10.Molly LOVE Nash and everything about him."Hey Luke,"I say."Right ankle?"Luke asks."Yeah,"I say."Elizabeth go get the Ace bandage,"he instructs.Mom gets up and goes out to get the wrap down the hall."Ross and Molly are here,"he says."Dad,"Ross says.Ross looks at me and rolls his eyes."What did I do?"I ask."Got a boyfriend right when I was going to ask you out,"he sasses."Ross I'm not the one to give a speech.Ross I'm not the right girl for you.That right girl is still out there.I'm not her.Dude your like a brother to me,"I say."Dad,"someone says.Molly."Molly Nash kinda has a girlfriend,Jenna.Your dad went to get me crutches,"I say."I know,"she cries."Don't cry.There are plenty of other fish in the sea,"I explain."Ashton?"Molly asks."Go for it,"I state."Who's Ashton?"Ava questioned."Ashton is a guy friend of mine that Ky dated,"I say."He has brown hair with blue eyes.And an amazing jawline,"Molly says."Oh.Can I see what he looks like?"Ava asked. I pull out my phone and pull up the picture I took of him in May."How old is he?"She asked."16,"I state."He looks 20,"she said."We know,"Ross,Molly,and I all say."He's not even popular,"Ross adds.All a sudden the door opens and........A serial killer!JK it's mom and Luke.I give Luke my right ankle and he bandages it up."Crutches till next Saturday,"Luke instructs."My birthday is this Saturday though,"I say."Wait to celebrate it then,"Ross suggests."I'm celebrating it I'll just use them when I'm out of the pool," I reply."Sounds fine with me,"mom says."Lets go,"I say." Bye nice meeting you,"Ava said.We go back to the car and I look ratchet. 1)I'm still in my pjs.2) My hairs going everywhere. We get home and I go straight tot he door.I ring the doorbell until Connor opens the door."Wow,"he says.I go straight through the door and go to the couch."Mia prop your foot up,"mom says.I put my foot on the pillow and use the blanket at the end of the couch.My eyes start getting heavy so I just close my eyes and take a nap.
