The two people who I thought were my friends, Jess and Aveth, they sent the link of my Limerence chapter to my mother and father. They had that number from when we pranked them. But my parents now know I'm pregnant, they were pretty pissed off and everything, but they didn't yell so that's good. They said they're gonna help me and stuff. I'm okay now, I guess.
