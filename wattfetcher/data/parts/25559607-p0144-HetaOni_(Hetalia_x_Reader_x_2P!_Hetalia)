I know I usually update once a week...but I was just on a roll last night!!.... and I realised being on a roll is a bad thing...because I end up writing chapters like this. (TT^TT)

So, while I was writing, I remembered that I haven't shown how Ollie was doing after Reader-chan or (Name)-chan walked through the mirror. [If you guys have somehow forgotten about that scene, please refer to Chapter 9 (Part 3)~]

All scenes in my story have either consequences and hidden meanings....so if you think a certain scene looks normal...or too normal....that scene probably plays a big role in the story later on!

...As much as I love Ollie, I have planned that scene for months now....so yeah....

....You guys are going to hunt me down for that chapter, huh?
