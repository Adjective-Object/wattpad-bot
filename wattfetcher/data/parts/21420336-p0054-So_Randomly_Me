Ha
Pshh
Me, obsessive??
Wutttt
You know what this kid said
He said star wars was better than percy jackson
It was in class
And my friends like
"Oh god.... you want to die."
I got up and glared at him
He shut up
See, my glares are scary
Because im generally nice
And my eyes look dead
So when I glare
I send all my hate
Yeah
Also I took blood of olmypus to school
Omg two fangirls
One looked at it AND yelled
"SHES PART OF THE FANDOM OMG!"
Another muttered
"I want that book so bad."
For some reason I hate the girl so I just had the urge to shove it in ther face
