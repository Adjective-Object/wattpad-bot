Erin's POV
"Why did you stay here? I thought you could have been dead, but this was almost as bad."
"Please, nothing happened."
"Sure it didn't."
"I can't believe you right now!" I screamed angrily.
"Like I wouldn't say the same thing!" Jordan screamed back.
"Stop!" I said.
"This is pointless, I'm leaving! Why did I even come? You might as well just stay the night again, you love him, right?" He asked.
"Don't leave!" I said.
"Why not?"
"Don't leave!" I said again.
"Good bye!" He shouted before slamming the door, I ran after him before he could get in his car.
"Jordan!" I sobbed.
"I'm leaving!" He said.
"You can't leave." I said.
"Why not!?" He asked spinning around to yell at me.
"Because you can't." I said looking in his teary eyes.
"Erin... I am leaving." He said walking away.
"You can't." I said.
"Please give me an answer, why!?" He asked.
"Because... I love you."
"I know for sure you don't." He said.
"Then why would I be chasing you outside telling you I love you? Why would I be sobbing wishing you still loved me? Nothing happened, Boo asked me to stay and my phone was dead, I couldn't call. Nothing ever happened I slept on the couch in the living room. I love you, why would I say I did if I didn't?" I asked.
"I do love you, that's why im so hurt, because... that's how life is supposed to be, full of hate and pain, I'm not supposed to get what I want." He said.
"No its not and yes you are, stop beating yourself down about this. I'm the one who made the mistake and I'm the one you should be beating down rather than yourself." I said walking up to him rubbing the tears from under my eyes.
"I have to think this one through... alone." He said getting in his car.
"Shut up! You don't! Talk to me... like before. I love you, don't act like you don't know it!" I said.
"You should have told me you were staying there."
"I know... I'm an idiot for that, I know you think something happened... but I can tell you one hundred percent honestly that nothing happened." I sobbed.
"I don't know what to think anymore."
"Then think I love you." I said walking to his car window and sobbing into it reaching for his hand even though I knew he wouldn't give it to me.
"I love you, but if something happened then tell me... that way we can work things out rather than scream at each other like idiots." He said grabbing my hand making me not hear what he just said.
"I love you, yes! I love you, thank you Jordan!" I said getting in the passenger seat of his car. "Nothing happened, I swear." I said attempting to hug him, he pushed me off of him gently and took my hands.
"I need you to tell me, this your last chance to be truthful if you haven't been already." He said looking in my eyes.
"Nothing happened." I said.
