I'm slowly dying
I'm crying
I'm trying
But it's worth nothing
No matter what I do I fail
I'm losing my trail
Where was I going
I thought i had a plan
But that's before it fell into the can
My mind is crazy
I feel like a baby
Crying daily
But what else am I spouse to do?
Suicide and depression
Keep me alive
The thought
Gives me something to think about
With out thinking
Why live?
My point.
There is none.
But.
I'm dying
I'm tired of crying
I'm tired of trying
Why live.
I'm dead inside already.
