"You excited for the show tonight?"
"Yeah, it's going to be great."
"That's, uh, good."
"Yup." I said making the p pop.
The rest of the walk was quiet and awkward with the occasional sound of Alan's camera going off before we got there.
We made it inside and a waitress quickly led us to a table and took our drink orders promising to be back soon.
He sighed before speaking, "Is it just me or is this awkward?"
"Nope, it's awkward." I said just as the waitress came back with our drinks.
"What can I get you two to eat?" She asked. We ordered quick before she left again.
"Why is it awkward?"
I shrugged and took a drink, "I dunno."
"I mean, we're friends. It shouldn't be awkward."
"I know," I said. "I don't get why it's awkward either." I lied stirring my straw making the ice clink against the sides of the cup.
Nothing else was said from either of us as we waited for our food. He went on his camera and I went on my phone retweeting and liking a few pictures that fans put up. Finally our food arrived and we started to eat silently.
I looked over at him and he was looking down at his phone now, texting someone.
"What are you doing?" I asked.
"Uh texting."
"Oh cool." I muttered.
"Oh sure."
I looked back down at my food, why is this so freaking awkward?  Eventually we both finished eating and sat there for a bit waiting for the waitress to bring the check.
"So have you had fun on tour so far?" I asked him.
"Yeah."
I nodded, "That's good. What'd you think of that whole Kellin and Vic thing? I mean he is your best friend isn't he?" I asked trying to make things less awkward.
"It was funny. I mean Kellin can take care of himself so he got drunk, had fun and it's whatever."
"Yeah, it was kind of funny though. I bet they're probably going to start dating by the end of the tour."
"Probably."
"Yeah..." I trailed off and silently started to thank god when the waitress came back with the check.
"I can get it." He said.
"No it's fine I got it." I said pulling out my wallet.
"No seriously, let me get it."
"Are you sure?" I asked.
"Yeah, I'm sure." He said pulling his wallet out and paid the amount along with a tip, "Let's head back."
"Yeah I have sound check in like 15 minutes anyways."
"Right."
I smiled and took one final sip of my drink and stood up Alan followed after me as we quickly left the restaurant
Another walk in which was silent and awkward. God I hated this. I didn't want it to be awkward with him.
