1) We were calling Domino's to get some pizza and my dad HAD to choose a weird name of course to put the pizza order under so he chose "Poindexter...." Then I was like "Poindexter?" And he made a face and was like "HI I'M POINDEXTER!" In his crazy voice and then the phone hung up. They heard everything and it was SO funny.
2) We just went to Burger King for my little brother and we were at the drive through and the waitress said "Just one moment." So this song came on and my dad started singing really loud and I was like "Dad! Shutup xD the workers can hear you." And he shrugged. Then he moved forward and my little brother was like "DAD U DIDN'T ORDER!" And I was like xD xD xD "All you did was sing in their drive through!" And there we were....stuck in Burger King's drive through in traffic. HOW DOES THAT SHIT GET SO MUCH TRAFFIC?! >w< Anyways....he had to go inside and order.
