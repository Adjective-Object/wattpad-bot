Brielle's pov(lucy): I was getting ready, With the help from Virgo and Aquarius i put a black with cream lace and metal chains on the side with black ribbon with a hook for thigh high socks and matching panties. I put on a black silk robe before picking a dress when Celstia (the celestial dragon) "Hime I found using a camera lacrima there is a Requip mage, Metalicana and Grandine's children, Your Nii-San" I looked Erza, Gajeel, Wendy and Mira "Celestia I have to bring them here" Shenodded giving me a key "Open! Portal to Magnolia forest" I stepped out "LUCY". Noones pov: The group of Mages ran to Lucy "Hey Guys I have to go ad you four are coming. Open! Portal to the Dragon Relam" They all stepped in "Wow" "Hey GRANDINE METALICANA c'mere" the two dragons came down to see their kids "Grandine/Metalicana" the two slayers ran "Now can we go back to the Castle" the four friends were confused but went on Grandine whilst Brielle Teleported and said in their heads "First one to the castle will get to share my room" and a certain Iron Slayer was keen too win "full speed dad" he grinned. Brielle's pov: I was waiting until i saw a iron slayer jump off his dragon "Well Well Well bunny girl you are stuck with me" I showed where they were sleeping and Erzie, Mira and Wendy didnt have a memory block none of my siblings do "Well I'm going to get dressed" I said dragging Gajeel so he could wear something other than his Tunic, genie pants and boots. I was picking a dress and I saw the most beutiful dress ever it was Black with White Lace it was a strapless love heart dress it was corset untill the hips and went out the back like a cape it was a skinny dress and showed enough cleavlege I grabbed the mask and asjed Cancer to put my hair into a small back combed with curls and two french fishtail plaits going around with curls at the end and my bangs and fringe down. I was at the top of the staircase with Gajeel who had a black dress shirt, cream tie, black pants, waist coat and black converse "Woah bunny girl you look hot" "you'r not to bad yourself" I smirked at him going down the stairs wendy,Erzie,Mira, Mama and Papa were at the bottom "Galu Galu Galu Galu Galu" Mira chanted I looked confused Galu "Mira-Nii what is Galu" "You'r ship name silly this was my biggest Demon Matchmaker MiraJane Vermilion OTP" She sqealed.
