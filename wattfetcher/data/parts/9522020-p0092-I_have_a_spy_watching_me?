"What?" We asked.
"If you told her what you know." She started. "She thinks that you two don't know. That's why she lied about the story of her Dad when you were around. She doesn't like to lie, so why don't you do something like tell her you knew what the freak was."
"Well, I could, but I don't want to scare her." I said.
"Chase. Everyone knows that you know. Everyone, but her."
"She has a good point Chase, tell her so that I can stop acting oblivious about it." Skull said.
"Fine, fine, fine! I will."
"Good."
I rolled my eyes as the bell rang. I told Tania to do it. She got up and went to go get Jaycie. Skull went to his car. I went to my car and I was at the restaurant. I got the place set up and we were set. I got Mr. Garretson informed and he said alright. I asked Jaycie's Dad and while he was reluctant he did give me permission.

*Jaycie's POV*
"Okay you guys this isn't funny anymore. I thought you guys were joking when you said I wasn't going to eat at the food court." I said as we pass the food court. I was really looking forward to getting a coney cheese dog with fries and a Dr. Pepper from A&W. "Where are you two taking me?"
"We told you not the food court." Tania replied.
"I noticed." I said.
"Come on Jaycie, calm down. We aren't going to hurt you. Plus I already know you are to strong for me to even fight. I'd die as soon as..." Tania slapped her hand over his mouth softly and I looked at them confused.
"What he's saying is that it's a surprise. Also disregard what he was going to say. It was probably something stupid." Tania glared at Skull as he continued to drive. He nodded at the last comment and said something through her hand.
I looked at them weirdly.
"Okaaaaayyyyyy......" I say slowly and disbelieving.
We arrive at the place and I notice that its Chase's family restaurant. They tell me to get out and I do. I walk to the door and open it. I had noticed Chase's car in the front so I yelled out Chase's name.
"Chase? Are you in here?" I asked.
"I'm here." He yelled back and I heard foot steps coming and he was here in the open.
"Why is it dark?" I asked him.
He came closer as he answered me.
"I've got two surprises. I'll explain why the lights are off after the first surprise." He said.
"What's the first surprise?" I asked cocking my head to the side.
"I wanted... I want to ask you if you want to eat lunch with me." He says.
"That's it?" I asked, but I noticed he was turning pink.
"Would you say yes if I told you it was for a date?" He asked and I stood there surprised.
"You're asking me out?" I sounded like I didn't believe him. Would it be bad if I did thinking that this was a dream?
"Yes, Jaycie. I'm asking you out." He said nervously. "I mean you don't have to if you don't want to..." He rambled and I cut him off short.
"I would love to, Chase." I said and he finally looked up with a surprised look of his own. Then he had a boyish nature as he smiled.
