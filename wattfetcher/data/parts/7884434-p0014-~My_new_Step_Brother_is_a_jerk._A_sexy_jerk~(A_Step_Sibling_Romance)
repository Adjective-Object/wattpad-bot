Chapter 5
Colton Haynes as Casper!
Shea's P.O.V
"Lisa for the last freaking time me and Shea are not a couple!" Seth yelled
"Bull crud Seth! I see the way you look at eachother! Just casue im 10 doesn't mean I am ablivios to things going on around!" She yelled back.
"Lisa there is nothing going on between me and Seth okay?" I said calmly
"Shea, can't you see the way he looks at you? I want someone to look at me like that" She said sadly
"Like what?" I asked curious
"Like you are the most wonderful thing on the planet" She said with a mumble.
"Sweety there is nothing going on between me and Seth. Im sorry"
"You both are stupid! How can you both be so blind!" She yelled.
"Lisa just shut up!" Seth yelled
"Fine both of you end up with people who you shouldn't" She said crossing her arms over her chest.
"Thank you" Seth sighed
"No your not welcome! I can't believe how blind Shea is forst of all, the way he looks at you Shea. I may be 10 but I know when someone looks at you like that they care a lot! Its kinda like the way dad used to look at mom" She said sadly.
"Thats bullshit! Why would I look at Shea like that?" Seth said angrily
"Because you obviously like her duh! And Seth c'mon Shea wouldn't have let you kiss her if she haden't felt anything for you!" She said flaling her arms.
"FOR THE LAST FREAKING TIME LISA THERE IS NOTHING BETWEEN ME AND SHEA!" Seth was yelling really bad now. It frightened me.
"Seth stop! She is your 10 year old sister! Not one of your friends! So treat her with respect and don't yell at her!" I said rainig my voice a little.
"I can talk to her how I want Shea!" He said pulling into the driveway.
"Your an asshole! I would take back that kiss anyday! Screw you!" I said slamming the car door.
"Shea wait!" He said calling after me
"No screw you!" I grabbed Lisa's hand and pulled her int he house with me. "Just go in your room for now so Seth can calm down. I'll be in my room if you need anything" I said walking towards my room.
"When I got inside I sat on my bed and brought my knees up to my chest. I burried my head in my knees and started to cry. I didn't know why I was crying. I need to visit my dad. That always makes me feel better.
I grabbed my car keys and grabbed my purse. I walked to my door and opened it. Seth was standing there. He looked up at me and softly smiled.
"What do you wa-" He crashed his lips to mine and I instantly dropped my bag and keys and wrapped my arms around his neck pulling him closer to me. I had no idea why I was doing this! I was mad at him fro christ sake! But god his lips. They were so soft. But I can't. I can't let him reel me in anymore.
"Seth stop" I said braking the kiss. He looked into my eyes and caresed my cheek softly with his hand making me catch myself from cuddeling into it.
"I'm sorry Shea" He said softly resting his forehead against mine.
I pushed him away and picked up my purse and keys. "No Seth. Stop playing with my emotions. Don't kiss me unless you feel something for me! Your a player. I can't fall for you. I won't fall for you. Now if you'll excuse me I have to go see someone" I said pushing past him.
