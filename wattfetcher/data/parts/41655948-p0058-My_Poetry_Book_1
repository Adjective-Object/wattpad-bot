I am in love with you.
You are my dreams,
My stars,
My everything.
I've known people longer than I've known you
But those feelings aren't anything compared to my feelings
I have for you.
And somehow, you seem to understand the
Complex galaxy inside my mind
And you actually wanted to explore,
Not just watch from the windows.
You have been nothing but amazing
Since we met.
You make me feel more like myself.
I broke into tiny shards of glass long ago.
I thought I lost all my pieces and gave up trying to find them
But it turns out, you had all the pieces
And you put me back together.
