Allen went over to us and spoke, "Uh-oh. Looks like the dollface is preettyy confused about what the fuck just happened." he chuckled.


"Should we tell her?" Flavio asked, turning to me.

All of a sudden, they heard a phone ring.



"Oh, it's your phone, Japan." Spain pointed out.


Japan took out his phone and nodded as he saw the screen. "Indeed. Please excuse me for a bit." he then distanced himself a little as he answered the call and set it to speaker phone. "Yes, this is Japan-"

"What took you so long, Japan?!" the Korean man on the other side of the line scolded.


Japan's eyes widened as he realised that it was South Korea who was speaking to him. "Oh...you...Long time no see. What is wrong?"



"What's wrong, you ask? Well, nothing, really. I-It's not like I was worried about you or anything!" South Korea denied.


Japan gave a confused look as he heard the statement. "I'm sorry? W-well, you may not care, Korea, but...er?"


"Pfft! Japan! Korea just called because he was worried about you! You didn't call him, so he got tired of waiting!" China laughed.
