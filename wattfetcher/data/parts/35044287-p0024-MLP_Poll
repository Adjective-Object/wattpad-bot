Really! This is a really good song. I almost want to keep it. But oh well they all can't be the best. I have to admit I did not expect this one to be the next one out. Well anyway if you voted this song you get to vote out another song. So Let's Get Started!

And the nominees are:

TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME
LET THE RAINBOW REMIND YOU
HELPING TWILIGHT WIN THE CROWN
CRYSTAL BALLAD
FRIENDSHIP THOUGH THE AGES
WELCOME TO THE SHOW
SHAKE YOUR TAIL
SHINE LIKE RAINBOWS
PERFECT DAY FOR FUN

Good luck to the nominees
