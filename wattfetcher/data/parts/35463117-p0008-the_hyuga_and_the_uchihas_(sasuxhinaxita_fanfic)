Sasuke POV
Why the fuck did I tell her that?!? I scolded myself. Damn it that was supposed to be a secret!! One I should've forgotten!!
"Um, sasuke?" Hinata asked, shock written all over her face.
I looked up in response, "listen you can't tell anyone. Hell I'm not even sure why I told you........I thought I forgot about it..."
"I won't tell anyone." Hinata promised. "I just wanted to know, well the reason your so red..."
I'm red because I am worried or something, I answered silently, "like I said, I don't know why I'm telling you this. Its most likely embarrassment." I said looking away.
"I'll still be your friend." Hinata said like she could read my thoughts. "I wouldn't want to lose the first friend I've made here so quickly."
"Thanks hinata. Just promise me you won't try to hang out with him okay?" I said. "And if you go on a mission with him just be careful."
"Okay."  Hinata promised.
