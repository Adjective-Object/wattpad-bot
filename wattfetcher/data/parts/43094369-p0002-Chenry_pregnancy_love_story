(Charlottes POV )It's been three days since I found out I was pregnant with Henry's baby.But now I'm really worried.I have to be at work in less than 20 minutes and I want to keep the baby safe but without Henry or Ray finding out. But first I have to make myself look normal and not suspicious . Today I decided to wear a lime green off the shoulder tank and black leggings with a sparkle trim on the bottom with mint flats to bring it together.Also for extra security a grey pullover. Time to face the world CharlotteAt work ... once I got to work I was about to go on the elevator when I realized. Maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea because that thing is kind of dangerous.So I decided to go down the tube to be safe .(Charlotte walks out of the tube)Ray : hey Charlotte why did you come down the tube and not the elevator?Charlotte: ohhh.I um feel yesterday and bruised my back and I don't want to fall on it againRay:oh,okCharlotte: so what do you want me to work on firstRay : nothing until Henry gets here Charlotte ohh,ok (sits down at desk and goes on phone to Twitter )(5minutes later) - Henry falling down the elevator Henry: hey RayRay : your lateHenry: sorry my family got stuck in traffic from the airport Ray: well now we can get startedRay Charlotte !charlotte!
