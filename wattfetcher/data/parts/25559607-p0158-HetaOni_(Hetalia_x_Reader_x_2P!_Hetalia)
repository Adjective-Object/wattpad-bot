Past Italy stared into Past Germany's sky blue eyes and spoke ever so softly, but enough to be heard by him.
"I...I don't...want to die here...
I wanted to escape with all of you......"
At that, Past Italy just....stopped. He stopped moving. He stopped breathing.
He was dead.
Past Germany noticed this and started shaking the man he held closely in his arms.
"Italy?
Italy?
Italy...
...... Italy!!
ITALY!!"
"No..." Past England let out as he realised the situation.
"Crap...Japan, take the others outside! West is out of control!" Past Prussia ordered theothers.
Past Germany broke down completely, tears were now falling down from his eyes and landing on his friend's face. "Italy!!! Italy!!! Stop screwing around!! Your eyes are open!! Italy!!! Italy!!!"
"Germany is--" Past America was about to ask something, but bit his lip when he understood what was happening.
Past Prussia limped towards his younger brother and turned to his friend. "West! Calm down!! France!! Please, gimme a hand here!!"
"Italy is... No... it's impossible... Wait... Why..." Past France muttered softly, unable to accept the situation.
Past Prussia placed a hand on his brother's shoulder. "Wait, West!! Calm down!"
"Japan, let's leave. Your injuries are the worst--...... Japan?" Past England said to Japan, but stopped when he saw the Japanese man....had tears streaming down his cheeks.
Past Japan shook his head and tried to wipe away the tears. "I'm sorry... It's been a very long time since I lost a friend... I don't know... how to react...
I feel sad, but also angry and hopeless, and empty... I don't know how I should feel. But I can't stop crying..."
"Japan... let's leave. Besides, it would only make things worse if they saw you like that..." Past America suggested, thinking of a way to comfort him.
Past Japan nodded. "...... Yes."
=outside the room=
"...(Name), are you okay? If you can't stand up, you can lean on my shoulder." America offered me.
After what just happened in front of my very eyes, I felt weak and barely able to hold myself up, so I took America's offer. I leaned on his shoulder for support, but noticed something. "What about you, America? You're clenching your hand too tightly. It's bleeding..."
"... This is why I didn't want to break the clock...I can't do anything to help here..." America told me and Japan, who was looking down on the floor quietly.

The American ran his fingers through his hair and spoke, "What the hell... Someone always, always--"

"--You're kidding... right? Italy is--Wait a moment! How could such a thing..." we overheard Past Canada talk.
Past Russia pointed at the door. "... Those voices coming from the room--Is that Germany and his brother? I guess we'd better not go in. They were...the closest to him..."
