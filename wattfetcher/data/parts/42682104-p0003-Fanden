My alarm went off and I groaned rolling over, falling off the bed in the process. I got up and changed before grabbing my little leather bag and put my iPad in it along with sunglasses and Chapstick. For it being morning I was in a decently good mood. Straaaaaaaannggeeeeeee~ I grabbed my keys to the blue pickup truck and my my way to the café. I pulled up early and unlocked the door leaving the closed sign on 'closed'. I plugged my iPad into the speaker and played some soft classic rock in the background like The Eagles, AC⚡️DC, and Bon Jovi. I warmed up the coffee machine thing and warmed up the pastries that made last night. After about half an hour I flipped the sign to open and turned on our neon. And it was still only seven. After a while the place started to fill up.
I looked at the clock. 10:17 am. I sighed slightly and turned my attention to the shop phone as it rang. I reached over and grabbed it. "Good morning! Fanden Alt Café what can I get for ya?" I asked in a cheery manner. "Morning." A partially groggy voice replied. I grabbed my pen and note pad to write this down. "Um can I get two caramel vanilla lattes, an almond mocha, and a blueberry sunrise smoothie. Along with five cheese Danishes?" He inquired kindly. "No problem." "What is your address so I can pick up?""9354 on the corner of 3rd and George." "Thank you I should be around in fifteen." "Can I get a name for your order?""Just put Unicorns on it and when I come in you'll know its mine." "Thank you. Have a nice day."I chuckled. "You too." With that whom ever it was hung up and I put the phone back down on the receiver and started preparing his order. The coffees were put in the microwave to stay warm and the smoothie in the fridge. I didn't bother with the pastries yet. I tugged at my sleeves listening to the music in the back ground. "Jer did Clint come in yet?" Mom asked as she walked in. "No mom.""But he's my favorite customer." "Mom. It's 10:30 you know that Clint comes in in an hour." I scolded her. She made a pouty face in return. "I thought I was your favorite customer." Lori pouted from her spot at the counter. "You're my favorite Lor." I grinned at the neon green haired punk. She had snake bites which I think are awesome. "But technically we aren't allowed to have favorites." "Did that ever stop you?" Her honey colored eyes flashed. "Not in a million years. Request?" I asked nodding toward my iPad. "I Alone." She grinned. "Lori.............you're the best!""Obviously." She flicked her hair over her shoulder. "After it play The Light Behind Your Eyes." "Good idea!" I smiled widely. I skipped over to the musical device and unlocked it. I scrolled through the artists until I finally found what I was looking for. The music play softly from the speakers. When I got back to my seat a guy was on the other side of the counter. "Hiya! Welcome to Fanden Alternative Café what can I get ya?" I asked politely. "I'm here for my order. Unicorns." He was completely straight face and serious. I instantly started laughing. "I'm sorry. You the guy who called in the order?" I chuckled and he nodded. "You don't look how I expected you to. Better actually in some way. Why so serious?" "I understood that reference." He cracked a small smile."I understood that reference. I'll be back in a second,....?" "Mikey.""Mikey." I smiled. I brought back the coffees and one of those little egg box cup holders. Then went back for the smoothie. I used tongs to get Danishes and wrapped them in tissue paper before putting them in a paper bag that had our logo on it. Meanwhile Lori just stared at the two of us with wide eyes."There ya go Mikey." "Thanks. Is that My Chemical Romance?" "Yeah. The Light Behind Your Eyes. You know know them?" "You could say that." He shrugged. "You know who any of the members are?""I know their names but never met'em never seen'em.""Would you like to?""Well yeah but, there is a lot of people less fortunate than me who would also like to meet them so I fine with enjoying their music." "I have a band so if you would like to have a live performance later then we would be glad to stop by.""That would be fantastic!" I grinned and watched him turn around to leave as Skylar walked through the door. "By the way what's the name of your band?""My Chemical Romance." "...............Unicorns." Skylar said slowly giving Mikey a pointed look. "Unicorns?" He questioned back."Unicorns." Skylar gave him a sleepy smile. "I'm gonna hang around a while." He grinned while pulling out is phone to text somebody and went to go sit in a corner booth. "Mom! I'm going fo' a walk because I'm bored and if I don't do something soon I will go insane." "Okay. Be back soon." I grabbed my phone and little black sweater thing. Stuffing my phone in my back pocket with my wallet. I waved to Lori and gave Skylar her coffee while taking my own and leaving the shop.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
