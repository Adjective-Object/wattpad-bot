V: How about we burn it?
Jimin: I hope Hobie hyung is okay :(
"Yeah..."
-J-Hope walks back in-
J-Hope: Okay..uhm..(sighs) let's do the routine again.
Everyone nodded.
Jane: Hobie you alright?
J-Hope: I'm fine..
By the looks of it, one could tell he is a very strong individual who doesn't look back at the past.

-Hyun-mi POV-
Damn, I remember I was so happy about what Ally and Hobie went through. I hate her so much I wished she'd die. But after seeing the phootage the news didn't show. I feel so sad for them, and now I'm actually happy for them being together. They're seriously a power couple, like all time. Aww poor J-Hope, his fans really didn't have any idea what he was going through. Oh god bless him and his family.

-J-Hope POV-
I hope Ally got the job.
Wonder how my triplets are doing, they better be behaving.
RM: And. Done.
Rehearsal was over, everyone went to their bags, some did stretches others got water. I checked my phone, no messages. I sighed.
Jin: I'll wait for you guys downstairs, goodnight Hobie.
"Yeah night hyung.."
Jungkook: How's noona?
"Good. She went to an interview today. She finally applied for a new job."
Jungkook: (gasp) what kinda job?
V: She left us :(?
I chuckled. "I'll tell you when she gets the job."
Jungkook: Okay :)

-Jin POV-
-after a full day of work, everyone is going home, Jin leaves a bit earlier-
Well, it's about time I can go home. I'm so exhausted. As I step out and wait for the others, this old woman was passing out flyers and happened to give me one. My eyes slightly widen when I read it.
'WIN A TRIP TO PARIS!'
"I so have to win this..."
