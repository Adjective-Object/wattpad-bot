Mom! I don't want to go to North Carolina.
"I don't care what you want Lexx"
This isn't fair! I'm not going to move there! Its going to be totally awkward mom.
"I'm sorry Lexx I just need to get out of this town for a little bit. I'll make the finally disicion there."
What final disicion?
"If we stay in North Carolina"
Ok. This still isn't fair.
" I'm sorry Lexx I'm trying to get my life together and normal again"
What do you mean "normal" we've been doing perfectly fine on our own. Just cause dad left doesn't mean were not " normal"
" I never said we weren't normal. I said our lives aren't ...I'm done talking about this pack all your things"
What ever.
