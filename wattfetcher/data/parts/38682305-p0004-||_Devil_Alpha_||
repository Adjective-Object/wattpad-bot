"I've learned to live half alive". *THE NEXT DAY* I've looked at the red mark on my neck. Tears filled my eyes, just looking at it made me mad! I took some clothes from the bag Luke gave me. A large hoodie and some black leggings along with my white converse. Where did he get these? They are mine, I could tell. I walked back to the large bathroom and locked the door once I got inside, I took a small towel and a large towel and sat them on the rack. I started to look for some soap or shampoo. Looking around I went a little farther into the large bathroom. There was another closet close to a tub. It was like a whole other room!! I ran back got my clothes and got some shampoo, conditioner, bath salt, and soap out of the closet. I started the water and just sat inside until the warm water touched my sensitive skin. How did everything turn into this? Why would he do this? The last words I fell asleep to were "I hate you." I have to do something! He can't just treat me like this! It makes no sense. I started to think about ways I could get out of here.      "HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE? OPEN THE DANG DOOR!"       Oh no..++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hey guys!!
