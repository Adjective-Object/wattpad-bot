I don't like the awake. It's like one big migraine. Just.Everything is so vivid. People are loud. Colors are bright. The sun hurts more than usual. The lights burn my eyes. Smells are strong. When I touch things I feel them.
I just want to float again. I want to be free from the awake.
I want to be done.
