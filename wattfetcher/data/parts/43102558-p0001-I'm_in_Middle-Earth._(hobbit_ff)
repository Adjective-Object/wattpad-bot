I looked around the book store. I found the hobbit and lord of the rings books. I picked them up and carried them to the register. The woman at the register smiled. I bought the books. "Would you like a free reading?" The woman offered. I nodded. She led me into a small room. An orb laid on a weird stand. I sat down on one end as the woman sat on the other side. The orb started to glow. The woman's eyes were glowing too.
The orb showed images of a strange world. I felt the freedom coming from it. The orb stopped on an image of a handsome man. The woman smiled again. "You have a great destiny." The woman said.
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"The world you see needs your help. The man you see needs your guidance. You will wake up there. That world will change you. They need you. You are important to their future."
"Yeah right. I am not important. I need to leave now. Only god knows what you want to do to me. Goodbye and good day."
I shot up and grabbed my books. I ran out to my car. It was storming outside. I drove away. I stopped at a stoplight. My phone and headphones were in my pockets. I turned on my music. Out of nowhere, a helicopter fell out of the sky. It landed a few yards away from me. One of the wings flew in my direction and stabbed me in my stomach. Pain shot through me. I blacked out quickly after impact.
....Time Skip....
"I hope she is alright." Haley's voice filled my ears.
"She will be fine." An unfamiliar voice assured her.
"He is right. The wound is already healed." Blake's voice agreed.
My eyes fluttered open. Haley, Blake, and an elderly man in gray were watching me. I leaned forward then stood up. I looked around. I turned my gaze to the stranger. "Who are you?" I asked.
"I am Gandalf the Gray." The stranger smiled.
Wait. Gandalf. Gandalf. I know I heard it from somewhere but where. I've got it. I'm in Middle-Earth. I thought.
"Where are you going?" I wondered.
"To the village of Bree. All three of you can come with me if you wish." Gandalf offered.
"Ok. We will." I accepted.
Gandalf took the lead. "I know where we are. Follow my lead no matter what." I whispered to my siblings. They nodded in agreement. We rushed to catch up with Gandalf. We're going to Bree. That means that I get to meet the Thorin Oakenshield. I smiled.

Hi. This will be a Fili/Michelle/Thorin, a Haley/Kili, and a Blake/Tauriel ff. There is more to come so don't worry. Do you think I should let Thorin and Fili live or let them die and have Michelle and Haley find new love? I need it for the second book. Don't forget to vote and comment. -Faith-
