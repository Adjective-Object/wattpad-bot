Mr. Hawkins sighs a little. "Then maybe you should do something about the things on your arms."
I get extremely annoyed and snap. "God, you all act like you've never seen a scar before! So I have scars. What I do with my body is my choice! I may not be incredibly proud of the choices I've made, but I'm not ashamed of them either!"
People make oooo sounds and Goldilox claps slowly. Mr. Hawkins looks like he's about to say something, but the bell rings. "Here. Here's the freaking assignment." I put the drawing on his desk, grab my bag and jacket, and walk out of the classroom.
I'm heading to English when Izzy runs up to me. "Hey Clary! You're pretty cool. Wanna have lunch with me and my friends?"
"Sure Iz. I'll see you later then." I walk off to English knowing I'll have to hear bull shit about my scars all day.
