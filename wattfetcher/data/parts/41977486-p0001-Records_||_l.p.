I looked up from the magazine I was aimlessly flipping through when the door to the shop opened and slammed closed with a man leaning against it. I knit my eyebrows in confusion as I studied him: his eyes were shut tight and he seemed to be muttering to himself about something.
I looked past him through the shop windows and there seemed to be a mob of teenage girls. All of a sudden he snapped his eyes open and his gaze landed on me, standing behind the counter. "Please don't scream."
"Why would I scream?"
It was this man's turn to look confused as he studied my nonchalant posture. "You don't know who I am?"
"Should I?"
"I'm Liam... Payne. I'm in One Direction."
I raised an eyebrow because I honestly had no idea what this kid was talking about.
"Is that some kind of gay porn?" [A/N: Not meaning to offend, she just doesn't know who they are.]
His eyes widened in surprise and his face flushed. He held his hands in front of him as a way of telling me that I was wrong. "No, no, no. It's my band."
He walked over to the grand piano and sat down on the bench. As he started to play, I vaguely recognized the tune of the song but I didn't know from where. Then he started singing and he had a really good voice.
"And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
" I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh"
I nodded in appreciation. "Not bad for someone that I've never heard of before."
He smiled sheepishly and stood up. "I think my fans are gone. Thanks for letting me hide out in here."
I turned to look out the window and found that he was right, the mob of teenage girls had disappeared. Liam made his way towards the door and put his hand on it about to push it open. He stopped and turned to look at me. "What's your name, love?"
"It's Lily. See you around, Liam." With that he exited the shop, and that was my excitement for the day.
