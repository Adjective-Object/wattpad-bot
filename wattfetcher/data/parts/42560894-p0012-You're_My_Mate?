"He..." I cut my wolf off."No, I don't want your pep talk about, oh he loves us, oh he will accept us...its just a lie, stop trying to convince me that he really wants us when we both know he never wanted us in the first place." Siege stayed quiet.
I walked out the door and went down the pathway. Why was he so emotionless?
Cameron's POV:Kyle told me about the attack and that there was few injuries. I'm glad that Rosaline said to double up last night or there could of been more.
As he was about to leave he said "by the way she came onto me...I wouldn't let her out of my sight, she sure is fine" I growled "get out!" He smirked and left the room.
That's not true, she would never, but I don't know her to begin with. I grew angry. This has set me back to my darkest hour, heartless.
I called her in. To tell her that I thank her for the warning. My wolf saw the scared reaction in her. At this moment I didn't care, how could she? She said your welcome and left.
"She didn't..." I cut Zach off. "Stop making excuses..." I growl at him. I heard a whimper and a door close. She left. "She's hurt, and it's your fault... I'm not helping you this time" Zach said angry.
I didn't do anything... And I'm not asking for her forgiveness. I'm the alpha, they should be the one to come crawling back to me for forgiveness. But somewhere in me, I know she didn't do it. But at this moment what do I believe...
Author's Note: I might double update tonight...should I? Something happens in the next chapter, but idk if I should put it up or wait till Saturday because I have my sixth drive tomorrow for driver's ed...well tell me or not, thanks for reading! Bye! @brightlights101
