Elsas POV
anna yells up the stairs "ELSA ELSA GUESS WHAT"
"What anna" I said
"we were accepted to the magic academy" Kristoff said "anna yelled it in my ear"
anna is still screaming
I said "ANNA CALM DOWN "
"Sorry" she said apologetically
"It's ok" I hope I meet someone nice there
"Ohhhhhhh I can't wait"
"Calm down anna"
"Ok ok sorry geeze" she said
"Let's get ready we only have a day" I said
"Ok" anna said
----------------the next day----------------
The servant calls us to breakfast
I hope I meet a frost born like me
My parents told me about jack frost when we were little and I still belive in him I bet he will be there
I hope he's there
Annas yells awoke me from my thinking
"THE BUS IS HERE ELSA GET HERE BEFORE ITS TO LATE"
I couldn't belive it
I was going to magic academy
I hope I just hope jack frost is there
I want to be loved but not the way anna thinks
"ELSA YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS"
I burst through the door in a heap and scramble on to the bus
"About time elsa" anna told me
"Sorry" I said
I was I  deep thought so I waited for us to get there
Right before we got thereally I saw a Glint of white and grey hair
Could that be jack frost

I want it to be him
He will help me control my powers
I want jack to teach me
