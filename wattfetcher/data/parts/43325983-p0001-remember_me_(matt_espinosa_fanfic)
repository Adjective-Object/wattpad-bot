Hey, my name is Alexis, but, I like to go by Lexi. I am 16 years old, I have black hair, brown eyes, and I'm 5'3, yes, I know I'm short. I am best friends with Matt Espinosa. Yes, the Matthew Espinosa, the vine famous one, you wanna know how, probably not, but I'm gonna tell you anyways, we met in kindergarten, and we were going outside, and then we bumped into each other, and just like that, we became best friends. We always hang out and I love that. We are not anything more than friends trust me, and he doesn't want to be anything more than that, well, I think. I mean he flirts with me but then he says he's joking around, which I believe, cause a bunch of guys do that. My best friend is Mia, she's tall and has brown hair, I love my best friend so much :)). Me, Matt, and Mia always hang out together, especially out of school. We all live in the same neighborhood, and all of our memories are there, me and Mia met in kindergarten too, we just became best friends after talking one day. I love my best friends, like, if you hurt them, you are gonna hurt me, or you should expect bruises cause I also do martial arts. Yup, that's right, I can punch and kick, so don't mess with a boxer's friends. But, anyways, I'll tell you my obsessions, boxing, swimming, yes I swim, dance, I dance too, Taco Bell, shopping, clothes, food, and Netflix. Netflix aka almost all of America's obsession. I also love the beach, cause being a swimmer, it's so much fun. And me and Matt are on the same swim team, which makes everything better. It always makes swim team way funnier. I love Matt so much, but just as friends. Trust me.
