Harry was right. Somehow, Lou had transformed this room from a bachelor pad to a completely decked out in pink, little girl's room.
"Damn." I walked in and looked at the floor. "I didn't remember this floor was actually gray."
"So what now?" Louis asked.
"Well, let's get rest of the stuff Lou brought in here."
It took us about a half hour, but we finally set everything up. I now had a playpen, a changing table, a highchair for the kitchen, and a bunch of toys and books. When we were done moving things, we pulled up a can of paint from the basement storage room and painted the bathroom. It wasn't perfect but it worked.
When we were done, Louis and Liam returned to the basement to write. Harry sat down on the couch.
"Wow, it's already five in the afternoon." He sighed.
I plopped down beside him, "I'm completely exhausted."
"Me too, mate."
We sat in silence. As I closed my eyes to rest, Belle squealed.
I sat up. "Oh my God!"
"You're so jumpy! Holy shit!"
I rolled my eyes, "Just leave."
Harry hopped up from the couch, "Got it, dad." He went downstairs and closed the door behind him.
I looked over at Belle, "You sure are pretty, baby girl. I can't believe you're mine though."
I picked her up and carried her to the back bedroom; her bedroom now. I placed her on the changing table and followed Louis' earlier instructions on how to change a diaper. It wasn't quite the same and I sighed.
"It's gonna take me awhile, baby. I hope you're willing to put up with me because I want to do right by you. I've fu-messed up a lot in the past, but I think you were exactly what I needed."
Belle giggled and that was the only sign I needed to know that we were going to be okay.
