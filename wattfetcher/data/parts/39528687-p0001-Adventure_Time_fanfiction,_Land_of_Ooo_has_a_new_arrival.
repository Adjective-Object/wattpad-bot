Finns P.O.V-I wipe the sweat from my head, I was building a new optical course and it was sweet! "Jake, I'm going to the junkyard, "I yelled to my brother he turned and smiled he was still a little bit sick from swimming in the ocean at iceberg beach the other day with ''Party God"sometimes my brother will do anything for a cute water babe, sometimes I think maybe I  could blackmail him with his crazy partying hehehe!!! As I walked I thought about her, she's always in the back of my mind, her curvy body, glowing eyes, and burning skin. I missed her "FP,"I smiled touching a blue flower that was growing at my feet "such a cute little flower," I could feel the heat generating from my face... I reached the junk yard,holding the little flower feeling the presence of someone behind me "Ice King," I whispered looking back, nobody.I continued walking as I walked I could hear whispers faint whispers almost like a snowflake had survived the hot summer days and was whispering to me. Finn you losing it! I tried to ignore it but it would not stop. I tried to make out the words they were gibberish. they sound like Korean lady, are you their, I pulled my Prismo sword ready for an attack threw the junk I saw no one and then in that few seconds the whispering stopped. "I know someone is here," before I knew it I had a bang then crash, "ahhh," a cream came from the junk "help,"I heard next. Spring into action "where are you!" Soon my question was answered as I ran around the first pile there a girl laid blood dripping from her leg her skin was a  golden color, blue strips, and white long hair,she was something,she was amazing her red her shot up at me. Her leg was caught in an old spring fox trap "get me out of this," she struggled blood of a dark purple oozed even more from her leg now her leg tighter in the trap tears ran down her cheeks, quickly I  open the trap scratching my hands on the rusty interior "Natura," she grabs her leg "thank you," she said trying to stand she was my size her hair fell to her knees symbols on her forehead were three blue dots. She had the reddest eyes. (which Jake tells me I'm color blind so they must be Emeril green.)
