Okay, so I apparently hit the chapter limit with my first book. Now I'm continuing with my shit ^7^
Nothing in this book is meant to insult anyone and I'm sorry if something still does. I mean no harm. And I don't mind people having opinions on things, so go ahead and tell me what you think. But remember good manners, my little ducklings!
Putting Russia in the cover was fair enough, since Finland got to be on the first one!
Without any longer speeches,
Welcome!
