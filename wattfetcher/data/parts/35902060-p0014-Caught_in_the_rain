"So, do you want an actually movie marathon or start off from OOTP ?"She asks as I climb on the bed. "Marathon." I say closing my eyes. She puts in Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone and climb in after me. I hold her close and sigh. She sits up as the theme song plays, and I go up  soon afterwards.
TIME LAPSE
They are now watching TPOA
"Why didn't Sirius just kill the rat right there and then?" I ask Tessa as we're cuddling. "I don't really know." She mumbles. I laugh softly and play with her hair. She sighs and twiddle a loose thread on her blanket. "Tessa, baby do you remember when we met the first time ?" I ask as Harry casts his Patronus. "Yeah." She mumbles softly. "Why did you say that to TJ? " I ask as her breathing steadies. I look down and see that she's sleeping. I smile and kiss her head. "I love you." I whisper and quietly get out of the bed. I get out of her room, and see that Oliver and Jasper are talking. I roll my eyes and join them. "Hey guys." I say as if I didn't want to punch Oliver. "Hey, Liam." They say. "Where's everyone? " I ask getting some Dr.Pepper. "They're finishing up the movies. We were just talking about a bonfire for dinner." Oliver says as KC comes in,then leaves again. "Where's Tessa ?" Jasper asks. "She's sleeping." I say heading out.
1 HOUR LATER ⭐⭐⭐
"Why did you wake me up ?" Tessa says angrily. "Well because its 7:38 and we need to know where the wood is." I say rolling my eyes. "Why do you need the wood ?" She asks fully awake now. "Bonfire. Don't worry we already texted TJ and asked if we could." I say pulling her out of the bed bridal style. I suddenly realize what I'm doing and set her down. "Sorry, Tess ." I mumble as she pulls me into a hug. She looks up with happiness in her eyes, and she kisses me. Sparks exploded and every  inch of me is tingly. (Not the perverted way people!) I kiss back and we break apart 30 seconds after. "There's nothing to be sorry about." She says leaving to her closet. I'm gonna marry her one day. I shake my head and go to the kitchen where everybody is at. "So is she up?" Spencer asks as Jasper walks out with hamburgers and hot dogs. "Yup." I say smiling and sitting down. Tessa walks out of the hallway smiling. "Have a good nap ?" Oliver asks drinking something. "Yeah,  and the wood is in the tree line. You can choose whatever you want. " She says picking up Tempy and going outside. "I'll go get the wood." Oliver says. "I'll go help you." I say standing up.
"So, is Tessa single ?" I ask acting nonchalantly. He sighs and looks at me. "What ?" I say smiling. "Nothing, jackass." He says pissed off. "Look, I know you don't like me or anything but  I'm with Tessa and we are happy together." I say angrily. "Look, I don't think that your relationship will last a week, 2 weeks at the most." He says walking onward. "That's wrong . We've been dating for 1 month now." I say trying to reach him. "And by the time it'll be Christmas break you'll be over. You'd break up with her and go to other girls. And the I love you act is as fake as Nikki Minaj's ass. " he says turning towards me. "You can't let anything be real can you? Most people when they feel something, they say it. Tessa and I are gonna make it after Christmas break and throughout everything else. The other girls aren't anything compared to Tessa. Tessa is my everything." I say surprising the hell outta of him. He looks at me and says "Okay." "We good man ?" I say hopefully. "Yeah,dude. Yo I'm sorry." He says as we do the bro hug. "I'm not the one you're supposed to apologize to." I say grabbing more sticks. He nods and sighs. "How bad was I?" He asks as we head up. "Don't do that." I say shaking my head. "Just tell me, so I know how big it had to be." He says looking at me. "You made her cry on my arms as she was picking me up. " I say as he gasps. "Damn, I'm a dumbass." He says as I laugh. "Yeah you were." I say as we see everybody at the pit. "Oh, you're gonna get it Ellison. " he says as I run away and laugh.
