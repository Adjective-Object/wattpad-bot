We woke the others up. I got on a pony with Thorin. I decided to enjoy our relationship while it lasted. It started to rain. I loved rain. We continued to ride until we reached a burnt house. I jumped off the pony. I could sense the pain from it. Thorin came to my side. He wrapped an arm around my waist. I was about his height. Thorin was 5'2" while I am 5'4". I was two inches taller then him. I'm not a full elf yet when I am I will be taller.
Gandalf and Thorin argued for a bit. I helped make dinner. I ran over to Gandalf as he started to leave. "You can't leave yet. We need you." I said. Gandalf stopped and looked at me. You can do this. I need to scout ahead. I will be back soon. Gandalf thought. My eyes widened.
I can read minds. Blake was telling the truth. I smiled.
You can also talk to people in their minds. Haley linked to me.
I went over to Thorin to calm him down. I placed my hand on his shoulder. Thorin smiled at me. I sat down in the grass. Thorin joined me. I rested my head on his shoulder. Thorin lifted my head up then kissed me. I kissed back. We kissed for a few minutes until Fili interrupted us. I pulled away. "Some of the ponies are missing. Bilbo went to free them from trolls. I stood up and grabbed my weapons. I equipped them. The rest of the company got ready for battle. Haley and Blake were staying in camp. I headed in the direction of a campfire. I climbed a tree. I took out my bow. Kili ran out.
"Let him go." Kili ordered.
"Do what?" A troll asked.
"I said let him go." Kili repeated himself.
The rest of the dwarves ran out. They charged at the trolls. They fought for a while. Bilbo freed the ponies. One troll went for Bilbo. I fired a couple of arrows at the troll's head. I camp out of hiding. I fired arrows at the trolls. One of them went to grab Fili. I shoved him out of the way only to get taken myself. Two trolls held each of my arms and legs.
"Let go of me!" I ordered.
"Lay down your arms or we will rip hers off." The lead troll ordered.
I gazed at Thorin. Sadness and anger filled his eyes. He threw his weapon to the ground along with the others. I was put in a sack on top of Fili facing him. I blushed madly. Fili smiled and winked at me.
"I knew you wanted me, but I didn't know it was this bad." Fili smirked.
I got up and wobbled over to join Thorin. He smiled at me. "The secret to cooking dwarves is..." Bilbo said. It caught my attention. Thorin and I looked at Bilbo.
"Yes. What is the secret to cooking dwarves?" A troll asked.
"The secret to cooking dwarves is to skin them first." I jumped in catching on to Bilbo's plan.
The dwarves called us traitors. A troll called us liars. It picked Fili up about to eat him. "No! Not him! He's infected. All of them are." I added quickly. The troll threw Fili away. The dwarves disagreed with us. I kicked Kili to get him to shut up. The dwarves now tried to one up each other about how big their parasites were. I saw Gandalf and heard him moving.
"May the dawn take you!" Gandalf yelled.
"Who is that?" A troll asked.
"I don't know." Another replied.
