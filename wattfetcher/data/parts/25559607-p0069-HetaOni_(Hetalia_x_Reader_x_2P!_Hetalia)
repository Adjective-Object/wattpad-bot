"Oh, God... Why...?" Italy muttered, tears springing from his eyes.
Prussia motioned all of them to make a run for it. "What are you standing there for?! Let's go! West, you too! Come on, quickly!"
Germany clicked his tongue and punched the wall beside him. "Damn it! Just when we'd finally found an exit!"
They all dashed back, but suddenly, Germany trips and falls over.
"Shit?!!"
Germany was immobilised, the monster creeping up behind him.
"Damn it... Is this it...?!" He thought as he closed his eyes.
>>Lost Germany.<<

The screen faded to black, and I saw Japan speak. His thoughts were flashed on the screen.
Japan : (... Is this one of the possibilities of what may happen from now on? Am I glimpsing an event that might take place, after all?)
(No, I can't just worry about it; I have to do something. Maybe if I let Prussia know what happened?)
---

"Prussia! Wait! Germany tripped over a rock!" Japan yelled.
Prussia stopped and turned to dash over to his brother. "West!!"
"Just go! Don't come back!" Germany ordered. "Shit! My foot got caught in a
vine?"
Prussia disobeys his brother and rushes over to stand in his defense.
"What the hell?! Why can't things ever go right for us?! Just when we were finally going to get out!!" Prussia cried in a frustrated tone.
Germany tried to get up, but it was useless. "Prussia! Stop it! Just run!!"
"Everyone else died! We're the only ones who are still alive! You three go back! It's
just too much!!" He said, bracing himself for the worst.
>>Lost Prussia.<<

Once again, the screen switched over to Japan's thoughts.
Japan: (If I call him to a halt, the others will lose their lives, too...
Whether we are countries or people has no relevance in this place. I can't forget that.)
(I--I feel so helpless! If I... If I did something before?
I can't let Germany fall over in the first place.
I have to do something before that can happen. If I do that, I'm sure it'll be all right!)

"Here! If I do something right here?" Japan thought to himself.
Japan charges forward and attacks the Thing. The monster took a blow and backed up a bit.
"This is the best case scenario so far!" Japan thought, a surge of hope coursing through him--distracting from the monster coming after him.
"Ugh!!" He let out as he coughed up blood.
