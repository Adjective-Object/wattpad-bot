I quickly changed into something fresh before going to the bathroom and fixing my hair a bit. When I decided I looked good enough I head out the door.  I walked straight into the venue waving at the few fans I saw before I was inside.
"Get up here Austin!"  Tino yelled.
"Alright! I'm coming!" I yelled back and ran up to the stage where the rest of the band was already waiting for me.
Sound check went by pretty fast and we all headed back to the bus to hang out another hour or two before the show."
"So are you guys pumped for the first show of the tour?" Phil asked laying down on the couch.
"Yeah, its gonna be fucking amazing." I said, "It's been so long since we've performanced."
"It's going to be great." Aaron said, "I just know it."
"Hell yeah." Phil said.
Just as Phil said that in walked Mike and Jaime.
"Hey guys." I said, "What do you need?"
"We're bored." Jaime said falling onto the couch.
"Yeah entertain us."
"Why your bus isn't entertaining?" I asked.
"Because Kellin and Alan are over there and they get really loud and really annoying after a while." Mike said.
"Yeah and Tony is asleep and Vic is just listening to them talk about nothing."
"That sounds boring."
"It is." They both said.
"Don't you guys have sound check soon?"
"In about an hour." Jaime said.
"Well we're not really doing anything here." I said just as my phone started ringing. I looked down at the caller I.D. and frowned before answering it.
"Hello?" I asked and stood up walking to the back of the bus.
"Austin." Jaxin said.
"Jaxin, what do you want?"
"I want you back."
"No." I said simply.
"No, don't. I really want to try this again. I miss you Aust."
"No Jaxin I'm not going to get back with you."
"Why not? We were really gre-"
"No we weren't "really great" together Jaxin. You nearly broke this band up. We fought all the time and all you did was use me!" I said cutting him off.
"I know, I fucked up but I want you back Aust, I wanna make it up to you."
"No, you said that last time we ended it and the time before! You used me as your toy and I'm not going back to that."
"It's different this time!"
"Like the other times? Really Jaxin, really? Because I remember you saying this shit every other time we did this. You say this and I believe you and then everything happens all over again. I can't and I won't this time."  I yelled before hanging up on him.  I threw my phone on the couch and groaned.
"Well that was intense." I jumped and turned around seeing Alan standing at the door.
"What are you doing here? I thought you were at Pierce's bus." I said.
"I have to do camera, photographer stuff."
