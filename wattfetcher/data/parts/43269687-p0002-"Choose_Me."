Henry was quiet for the rest of the day, so was I... Although we did do an occasional 'What's the answer to this question?'Pretty much it..She bell rang for lunch."Tonight's homework will be studying the upcoming quiz. Oh and Melissa, before you go, I need to talk to you."Henry turned to me."I'll wait for you outside." Then he left.I walked over to Mrs. Tracks desk.Her eyes flickered I stared at her... She sighed and stood up."Melissa... Sweetie, I'm sorry if I brought up any bad memories..."I still stared at her my eyes never leaving hers. "You may go now."I left closing the door behind me.Jeebus.... Life is hard..Signing and taking a step forwardI felt watched...A hand held onto my shoulderI jumped.
"What'd she say?" "Ngh!!!" I shrieked!"Don't scare me like that!!!Idiot..."He let out a chuckle. "Sorryyy!!!"
"Ugh."He mocked me"Ugh""Whatever, let's go to lunch.... I'm starving!!!"He smiled"Sure."
