"Dean. Your mere mortal power cannot even begin to match mine."
"Wanna bet?" Dean mumbled drowsily.
"Dean, I do not have to bet. I know."
"Cas... just go to bed."
"But Deeeeean," Cas whined like a child, "I don't think I can."
"Just think of something boring," Dean supplied. He didn't think it would actually work, but when Castiel thought of his brother, Raphael, and his voice droning on and on, he actually fell asleep.
Dean heard Cas' quiet snores and fell asleep to the quiet rhythm.
Four days later, everyone in the bunker had had enough. Castiel wanted to use his angel powers, Sam wanted to be free of all unresolved sexual tension, and Dean just wanted to pee without getting a boner from Cas' hand just being in the general vicinity of his dick.
"Oh, my GOD," Sam shouts, exasperated. "I'm going to find some keys! FEEL FREE TO HAVE SEX WHILE I'M GONE!" And with that, the moose-man left.
And while they didn't have sex then, they did once they got uncuffed. A lot.
But more importantly, Dean and Cas held hands quite often, as they looked back on the memories of being handcuffed. They always "slept" in the same bed, Dean always unwakeable, Cas sometimes asleep, snoring the night away, sometimes watching over Dean, like always. That's something that never changed.
