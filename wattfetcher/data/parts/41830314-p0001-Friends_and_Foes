As I pass the hallways, I can feel everyone's scared gazes follow me. I smirk at how well everyone knows me. It extremely hard to get a reputation such as mine. I do have a short temper and love to be unpredictable so they know to stay away. I have many problems and being rich is one. You see to be rich your parents have to work. Work means office, office means not at home, which means no time for the kids. My parents don't have time for me or my brother and to top it of they make us attend Heavenly Heights a stupid rich kid private school. I walk into class with a glare on my face ( like always). The teacher sitting on her the desk flashes me a welcoming smile.
" Welcome and-"
"Don't expect me to be excited," I tell her coldly. There's a lot of things that bother me and a cheerful teacher is one of them. She looks taken aback and I congratulate myself mentally.
I search for my seat. You see it's not really mine since its the first day of school, but by tradition I always take the desk in the right corner on the last row. I was surprised to see an extremely tall boy with pale blonde messy hair, dark gray eyes, and a smirk of triumph on his face. I guess I'm not the only person that likes to toy with people, I thought bitterly.
This story is like a combination of a lot of ideas, reality, studying peoples manners and personalities, and things I've wanted to tell people. So, yeah...Hope you enjoy it......(:
