"I'm Popeye the sailor man" I imitated, she burst out laughing as her head swung back her hair became a beautiful mess. I grinned as she brushed a tendril behind her ear "Oh can you still do the weird arm thing?" I asked, she smiled
"You mean this" she said as she twisted her arms behind her back and over her head again, I squirmed a bit and she just giggled at me reaction. I looked at my watch "what time is it?" Eve asked
"11:00pm" I answer "I better get home" I tell her
"Same it was nice talking to you Nick" she said before skipping away.
As soon as I got home Gran and Granpa gave me a lecture on why I shouldn't stay out so long. But for some reason I didn't care. All I could think about was Eve. As I got ready for bed, I looked at some of the pictures of me as a kid, I was always with Eve, I had my arms around her. She's amazing I did have a crush on her, I guess I still do but I can't do or say anything she's with Jack now.
I'm an idiot, why didn't I go out with her when I was 12?
