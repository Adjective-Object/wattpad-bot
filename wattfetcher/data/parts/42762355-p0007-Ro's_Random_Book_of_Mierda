//Tied to a sallow heart. Why does he want to bring me where he goes..? Oh, and to find out the reasons why, it's enough to make you try for one last night. Ghosts and silhouettes... They take a piece of me, they want it all. Oh, but to wait in an empty room with a feeling that it's closing in. I had a dream I was dying, but I found nobody there. And if one last night is all that we've been given, let's live it like we care... For one last night.//
- One Last Night by The Vaults -
Hmm... Well, the storyline goes, that Finny was pregnant with Russia's daughter for some time before she and her brother had to leave to get their independence. It really broke his heart, since he didn't have a clue, that she would actually leave with this unborn child.
Roosa knew what she had to do, but as she waited for Ivan in the empty room, everything started to feel like too much to handle. For almost five hours, they were having an intense conversation of should she stay or not. The man really did most of the talking... He had even planned to take her out to Moscow for a dinner and propose there. But popping the question happened desperately in the hope of it making her change her mind. Before that day, Roosa had been trying to leave, but everytime the man managed to push it away with his loving words, stupid jokes and sweet kisses, making her swear every night, that it would be the last one.

I found this from a chapter that was in my drafts-- ;-; It was all just... So many different feels... Why is my mind so brutal to Finny..?
