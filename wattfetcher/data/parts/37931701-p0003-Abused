I woke up in a hospital bed. Where am I. Wait, I remember, no the doctors will have already see the bruises. "Hello, Jordynn. How are you feeling today?" A man who I am guessing it the doctor."I'm feel sore.." my voice barely came out, "How long have I been out?""You had a lot of blood loss, and you were out for three weeks. I would like to discuss what happened." The doctor said a little more gently."O-okay, w-what do you w-want to know?" I said with my voice shaking, showing how nervous I was."Okay, for your safety none of this that we speak about leaves the room okay. We really do want to help, but in order to do that you have to tell us what caused you to make the choices that you did." The doctor said this with a really concerned face. Right as I was about to speak my father burst into the room.. "You attention seeking whore, tried to take your own life. Well it didn't work, but you will be dead soon."
Before I could say anything my father was on top of me beating me. I knew I was going to black out. The doctors tried to pull him off, but he was too strong. Before I blacked out I saw five figures walk into the room and pull my dad off me like it was nothing...
