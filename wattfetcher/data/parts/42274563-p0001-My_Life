Watching people is one of my hobbies...I imagine their lives by looking at them.
Their eyes are the ones that pursues me to observe them.I see different emotions that I once never had;joy,excitement,happiness ...
I see a young girl,having a picnic with her family...How I wish to also have one...
Instantly,all people in the park were gone.
I haven't noticed the rain pouring heavily on my head.
On my way home,which I barely remember,I passed by a bridge.The Famel Bridge.
The water down the river moves faster because of the heavy rain.I think its beautiful,unlike me who is just a frog in the lively river...
I continued on walking my way home soaking wet.
