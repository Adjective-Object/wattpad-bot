(*Shays P.O.V*)
I slammed the door and walked outside. It was beautiful outside I plugged in my headphones to my phone and turned on my music. "Heart Shaped Box" by Nirvana came on. I walked to school nodding my head to the music. I walked to the parking lot of my school and seen all the new people im going to meet. But one crowd stood out to me. It had a girl with pastel purple hair and she is wearing all black. Then I saw a boy with long curly brown hair he was wearing a feather button up with a red snap back and some jeans. Then another two guy's wearing black t-shirts and jeans. I walk up very slowly to the front door. Then I get stopped by the girl with the pastel purple hair. "Hey are you new?" She ask. "Ye...yes" I said. Shit I stuttered she must hate me. She laughs "Its ok we don't judge." She leads me back to the group. "This is Vic." and she points to the boy in the hat. I nod and wave my hand. "This is Jaime and Tony." I wave and say "I like your spiky hair Jaime." He rubs his shoulder "Thanks." I nod. "Oh ya I'm Lyric." The girl with the pastel purple hair said. "Cool I'm Shay." I said. We sit there by the cars for a bit while we talk about music and stuff. The bell rang and Lyric and the boys got up and started walking to the school so I followed. I was behind the group then Vic came back with me. He smiled at me I smiled back. I knew that I liked him right when I met him. "So what music do you like you didn't really talk about yourself when we were at the cars." Vic said. "I really like all kinds of music except country." I say. We make it up to the front doors. I looked at my schedule I had.EnglishArtMathLunchP.EScience Social Studies Vic looked at my schedule and I looked at his. "Looks like we have the same classes." I said. "I can show you where everything is." He said. I nodded my head. We walked to first period. When we opened the door Vics face went from the happy and smiley to anger and rage.
