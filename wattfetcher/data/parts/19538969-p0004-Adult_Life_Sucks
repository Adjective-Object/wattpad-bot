Moving on
Today it was really hard not to think of Jake...I still couldn't believe what he did to me.After all we've been through, he does this.So my friends Mya ,Georgia,and Jaellin all are hanging with me.We went to the movies.After Jaellin,and Georgia left,I got a call from my mom.She said"Come to the house tomorrow!"I asked her "Why?"She wanted me to stay with her.She was worried about me.I said "Mom!I'm fine!".OF COURSE EVEN WHEN YOU DONT WANT TO YOU HAVE TO!The next day, Mya ,and I went to see my mom.We spent the whole day with her.I spent the whole day with my mom and friend.We talked about the whole problem.I left my moms house...in the middle of the night.She wouldn't let me go.She doesn't want me to be alone.I told her "I have Mya's living with me,and I have other friends."Im not alone at all."I NEVER WANT TO THINK ABOUT J.A.K.E AGAIN!!!!!",I shouted to my mom."ok."my mom said.Mya and I left.the next day,I was fine.I didn't even think about him.I did my daily routine.Eat,watch tv,eat,call friends,eat,watch horror with my friends all night.i kept getting calls from my mom,just checking in,she says.i do the same God dang thing every day.
