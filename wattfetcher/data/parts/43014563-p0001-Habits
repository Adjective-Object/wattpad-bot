"I love you Aaliyah, I will seen you in a couple of hours" conner spoke to me as he kissed my soft cheeks and made his way outside.
"I love you too" I shouted and waved, as he drove of to work.
I closed the door behind me, locking the door and making my way to the kitchen of our home to prepare dinner.
Me and conner are both 18. we both live in a average house in the centre of Sydney, Australia. we met at the age of 14, became best friends at 15 and now we are together.
I am just a normal teenager. I don't smoke or do anything bad like that. yes I've maybe had the odd beer but I don't want to be known as the 'druggie' or the 'smoker' and 'drinker'. I want to be known as Aaliyah and that's it.
Conner, he is like me, never smoked or anything, as he hates smoking. we have never done anything bad. he has had more alcoholic drinks then me but never been hungover or anything. to be honest we are both quite innocent. We don't want to get in trouble at the age we are at, we want to make the most of our lives.
I suppose we just want to succeed in life, not succeed in being a failure.
