ARIANA'S POV
When I got to the park with Riley I took her over to the baby section. There are actually three sections to this park, one for the babies, one for children ages 8 to 12 and one for teenagers. That's a good thing as far as I'm concerned cause if any of these kids even dares to lay a finger on my baby they won't make it out of here alive.I know for a fact that these rides are dirty as hell so....yeah, my baby is not playing with those things. I sat down on a bench with her in my lap, she's playing with her teddy bear as usual and she looks so happy. This little girl always brings a smile to my face no matter what's happening. When the doctor told us that Ross is in fact, Riley's father, I was a little upset. I wanted to hear that she wasn't his daughter.....I wanted him to feel hurt and betrayed, just like he made me feel hurt and betrayed when he slept with my sister. I can't believe Alexa would do something like that to me though, she's supposed to be my sister...my older sister. But she slept with my boyfriend....and she told me that she doesn't regret it, no wonder Rocky broke up with her, she's a freaking whore and I think Sammi is way better than she is.

After some more minutes of me thinking, Riley started to yawn and when I looked at the time I saw that it was 8 : 27 pm. Wow, I was thinking for four hours and 39 minutes, new record!. I took Riley back over to the car and then I put her in her car seat and drove back to the house
