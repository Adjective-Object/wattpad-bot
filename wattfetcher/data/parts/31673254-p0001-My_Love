It's been two months since Edward left and all I can feel is despair..'my love, my heart, my soul...the look on his face dead and seething...till this day I still ask myself why me...I always knew his world moved toofast and burned too bright ,but I just thought that maybe he really  did love me like he said he did. Im in pain he left me...he left me..he left me...i wrap my arms around my knees and pull the upward to my chin. He's gone he doesn't want me anymore..so why couldn't I get that!I'm no longer his he left me,but I still wish him the best..I love him he doesn't love me. It's twelve o clock he'd be here now if he were here with his arms around me he'd kissing me passionately he'd STOP!I HAVE TO STOP! I cry I cry myself to sleep i'm no longer happy no my happiness left me in the woods my happiness tpok my heart out of my chest and stepped on it with his very being no I don't have happiness. Now all i am is cold, scared, beaten up, and worst of all I'm alone.
