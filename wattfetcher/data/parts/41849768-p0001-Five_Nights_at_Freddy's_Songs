We're waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years we've been all alone
We're forced to be still and play
The same songs we've known since that day
An imposter took our lifes away
Now we're stuck here to decay
Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
We're really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place good bye
It's like there's so much more, maybe you've been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors
Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
