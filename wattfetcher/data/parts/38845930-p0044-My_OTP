Erin's POV
They basically said I could go early because it wasn't bad it's just from lack of sleep and stress. They told me to get at least 5 hours of sleep every night and I will most likely be fine, I have been getting about 3 to 5 hours every night so I have to work on that.
I called my mom to pick me up.
"Hi, what's up?" She asked.
"Can you come pick me up? I was let out tonight." I said.
"Oh, yeah! I will be there as soon as I can. What happened to Jordan, why can't he pick you up?" She asked.
"The brakes broke on his car. Can you drop me off at Jordan's, I'm surprising him." I said.
"Yeah sure, see you soon."
I got out of the car and ran to Jordan's apartment building opened the door, rang into one of Jordan's apartment neighbors I met and they opened the locked door for me. I got to Jordan's floor and ran to his door, hair bouncing, arms swinging, I knocked on the door and as soon as it opened...
"I love you." I said before we kissed.
"Erin! Oh my god." He said.
"Yeah. I'm here until Boo comes back from my ex's." I said.
"You're here until Monday!?"
"I'm here until Monday!" I screamed with the biggest smile.
I hugged him and he squeezed me and shook me, Jordan is the sweetest, cutest, most amazing guy that ever existed.
Jordan's POV
"I love you." We repeatedly said to each other as usual.
"You are so freaking cute." I said.
"And why is that Mr. Sparklypants?" She asked.
"Mr. Sparklypants? You're going back way, way long ago." I said while looking in her eyes.
"Why am I cute?" She asked.
"Because your here and you came straight from the hospital... you were out of breath when you got up her, did you run?"
"All the way up here from the car." She said scrunching up her nose, squinting her eyes and biting her lip.
"Oh, stop being so cute." I said.
"No." She said.
"Stop."
"No thanks."
"Stop!"
"No I said."
"No." I said with a blank face just looking in her eyes.
"What?" She asked.
"No." I chuckled.
"What are you doing?"
"I can't stop looking at you." I said as I clenched her hand as tight as I could.
"Ow, Jordan. What are you doing?" She asked.
"I just can't stop looking at you." I said.
"So you have to squish my hand? Ow, Jordan." She chuckled.
"Sorry."
"My hand still hurts."
"Sorry." I said as I kissed her and looked up at her.
"Jordan, what is that look on your face?" She asked. I had a look of fear and happiness.
"My f -- What about my face?" I asked.
