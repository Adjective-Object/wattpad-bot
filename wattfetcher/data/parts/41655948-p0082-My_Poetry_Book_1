I love the world.
I love to wake up and hate the smell of cigarette smoke,
Thinking that's where I'm going to go.
I love to feel the grass weave itself
Between my fingers.
I love the way the sky has turned gray,
Or the way it feels to fall in love with just existing
As an energy, cycling through the world.
I love to write poetry in the deafening silence
Of these four walls.
I love to look out my window at the midnight display
Of a million stars and the moon,
Longing to get a closer look.
I love to know that I am being myself,
I'm getting closer to showing the world my true colors
Every day, and
It's not an easy process.
I love that I notice all the details that
Everyone else neglects to pay attention to.
I love that I can write a poem about some things I love
Without regret.
You guys know poetry,
And what it ignites within me.
I love to sit on Tumblr,
Listen to hypnotically (screw you dictionary, this is a word..to me, at least) happy music and
Think about life,
It's not negative,
I like to just think about the world and
All of it's beauty and
Where life's taken me so far.
I love to be poetic.
