---CHAPTER VI: Password (Part 2)---
When I sensed that Italy was going to leave the room, as well, I hurriedly rushed down the stairs. I went over to the pantry room in the first floor.
They were in the middle of trying to open the safe...
"5294.."
*click*
It opened!
A small popup appeared before me.
Obtained: Study Key.
Study....
"Which door do you think it opens?" one of them asked.
"Ah... I think there was a door in this floor that I wasn't able to open before. Maybe that's the key." I told them.
Japan turned to me. "Which one?"
I placed my hand on my chin and tried to remember. "The one in the hallway near the Tatami rooms, I think."
"Ah. That's right. Italy and I went there earlier. There was a locked room there." Germany confirmed.
Russia looked at the others. "Well, then..let's go."
We all headed to the study, walking in a quick but relaxed pace.
Used: Study Key.
We all went inside the study.
China looked around the room. "This place is almost empty, aru."
"Let's search the place." England instructed.
Ah... What were we supposed to do here..?
A switch was it?
I walked over to the slim Japanese man. "Oh. Japan, I'll check the bookshelf over there, you guys take a look at that er, table."
He nodded. "Alright."
I pretended to look through the books while I watched Japan from the corner of my eye.
"Oh. I found a switch." He reported.
Germany raised an eyebrow. "Really? Might as well press it."
The bookshelf in front of me moved.
"W-Whoa! Guys, over here." I said as I moved away from the bookshelf.
"It's a door!" China exclaimed.
Japan dusted his clothes and walked towards the door. "I'll check it out..."
I grabbed his arm. "Uhm, I want to go, too."
He gave a small smile. "Alright, let's go."
Japan opened the door and walked further into the room.
"I see something over there." He told me.
I locked the door behind me. If I remember correctly, it'll be Game Over if I dont..
He knelt down and picked up a small, metal object. "____-chan. I found a key."
A small popup appeared once more.
Obtained : Basement Key.
"Alright. Let's leave this room and go tell the others." I replied.
"Agreed."
When I opened the door, no one was inside the room.
