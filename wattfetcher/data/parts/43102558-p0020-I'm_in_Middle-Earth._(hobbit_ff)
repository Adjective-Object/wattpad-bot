Michelle's POV....
My weapons melted into scales. I took my dragon form and flew in the direction the company went. I was close. The smell of fire filled my lungs. I flew closer to see Azog's warg bite down on Thorin. I flew closer then shifted back to normal. I landed on my feet without being harmed. I drew out my sword. I ran at the warg holding Thorin. It released him and charged at me. I dodged it and sliced the warg's ear off. Bilbo joined me in protecting Thorin. He saw us before he fainted.
A screech came from above me as a giant eagle picked up Thorin. I turned into a dragon to let Bilbo get on. I flew after the giant eagles. We flew to a weird shaped mountain. I turned normal as I went to land. I caught Bilbo and made sure he didn't get hurt. Gandalf healed Thorin. Fili stood beside me. Thorin stood up and faced Bilbo.
"Did I not say that you wouldn't survive in the wild? Never have I been so wrong in my life." Thorin smiled and embraced Bilbo for a moment before turning to me.
"I don't care how many times you threaten to kill me. I will always be in this company. I am your seer." I stated.
"Why did you come back?" Thorin questioned me.
"I care about this company with my life. I forgave you even though you broke half of my heart. You can't stop me. Everyone in this company is my friend. I will protect them the best I can." I answered.
"Please let her stay uncle." Fili begged.
"We need her. She can help us." Kili added.
"Fine but you both have to keep an eye on her." Thorin agreed.
"Look a raven." Oin gasped.
"No dear Oin. That is a thrush." Gandalf corrected him.
"I will still take it as a good sign. The worst is behind us." Thorin smiled.
"Is that th-" Bilbo was about to asked.
"Yes Bilbo. That is the Lonely Mountain aka Erebor." I said.
I held Fili's hand. I can't tell them anything except for their deaths.  I sighed.
