I chuckled a bit at Calum who was gaping.
"I think we should get to know each other, considering we've met and the only thing we know about each other is we both like gay fanfiction." Calum states and I blush slightly.
Was he asking me out? I don't even know if he's gay or not. Well he does write gay fanfics and he is a boy, most straight boys don't do that.
"Okay. Meet me here at the same time?"
Calum nodded and we sat there discussing for a few minutes about his fanfic.
He gave me his number along with a wink and with that I was off, walking home with a huge grin plastered on my face.
--So...what you think .. Bad Ik I'm sorry
