"Screaming ain't going to do either of us any good. If I get caught, you do too," the man growled.
"Please...let me go," Billie whispered.
The man just grinned and brought his fist back again and punched Billie's eye. It almost instantly swelled up making it hard for Billie Joe to see. The abuser brought back his leg and kneed Billie in the gut a few times. Blood continued to gush out of Billie Joe's nose, but quite frankly, his nose was the least of his worries.
Billie Joe began to sob. He was in so much pain. He was running from the cops. He was losing weight. He's beginning to be suicidal. His life was a total train wreck.
"Awww, the faggot's crying," the predator said in a fake baby voice. He stuck his lip or only to intimidate Billie more.
This had no effect on Billie, for he continued to cry. He didn't care if self pity was useless. He just couldn't hold back the tears.
Billie looked around frantically for any possible way to get out of this man's reach, but his eye only landed on someone that he knew could be no help. Fink.
Fink watched Billie Joe sympathetically. For once, he didn't try to hide it with one of his signature devilish smiles. His eyes were filled with pure pity as he watched Billie Joe get beaten by this man. Billie looked back helplessly.
He thought about Tré in that moment. It was all his fault that this was happening. If he hadn't told Tré, then Tré would think he was crazy. If Tré didn't think he was crazy, then he wouldn't have suggested getting help. If he hadn't suggested getting help, Billie wouldn't have freaked out and tried to kill him. If he hadn't tried to kill him, he wouldn't be in this situation. Eventually, it all came back on Billie Joe.
Those thoughts were simply blocked out by the kicks and punches that connected with Billie's body that night.
