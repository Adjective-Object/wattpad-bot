Me: Hola mi amigos!
Anna: Stop. You don't even speak Spanish.
Me: Uh, excuse me, but have you been taking Spanish for years? I didn't think so.
Anna: *glares*
Me: ANYWAY, welcome to Ask and Dare Disney! Plus Jack and Hiccup.
Jack + Hiccup: Hey!
Gogo: What.
Jack: Why do we have to be plus?
Me: What.
Hiccup: It's makes us feel left out or like...sidelined or something.
Jack: Yeah.
Me: Oh *puts on fake caring face*...I guess I can see where that could be a little annoying.
Hiccup: Thank you.
Me: *straight face* Get over it.
Jack + Hiccup: *staring at me and frowning*
Hiro: Wow, we've barely started and you've already pissed a bunch of people off.
Me: It's a gift.
Elsa: So...what are we even doing?
Me: OH YEAH! As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted *glares at Anna, Jack, and Hiccup* WELCOME TO ASK AND DARE DISNEY!
*random guys come out of nowhere playing trumpets and throwing confetti and a banner saying 'WELCOME' on it*
Everyone: O.o
Me: Hey, they showed up! Thanks guys, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Tadashi: ...what just happened?
Me: That was our big opening!
Gogo: Never, EVER do that again.
Me: *pouts* haters.
Honey-Lemon: I thought it was nice.
Merida: You think everything is nice.
Honey-Lemon: Get out of mah face.
*explosion sound in the background and Honey-Lemon puts on sunglasses*
Wasabi: Okie...
Fred: Where'd you get those sunglasses from?
Elsa: *sighs* What has our world come to?
Me: Ok...? ANYWHO, please vote, dare, and ask!
Fred: ...NO WAIT SERIOUSLY WHERE DID SHE GET THE SUNGLASSES FROM?!
