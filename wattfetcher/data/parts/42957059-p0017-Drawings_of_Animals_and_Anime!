This beasts is one that I drew today so you guys will be the first to see it. You may have to turn your phone or look sideways to see it because I couldn't fit it all in by doing it potrait way. Doy!
Just one touch of it and you could get seriously burned or hurt. So watch out! XD
Thanks for the views, guys! I'll keep trying!
