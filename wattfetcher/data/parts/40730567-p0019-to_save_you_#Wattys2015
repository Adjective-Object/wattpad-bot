Skylynn was one of the girl that neither Mandy nor Abrielle liked. But because they went to school together, and their parents were friends, they had to tolerate each other. They once used to be really good friends. But then Mandy realized that Skylynn was a grade A-bitch because she liked her brother. And that was pretty much the only reason she had befriended the two girls. Mandy had cried that day, and Abrielle watched. The next day, Skylynn's locker was full of condoms. No one ever knew who did it, except Abri. She would do anything to see a smile on her best friend's face.
A lot of families were gathered in Abrielle's backyard. Mandy and Abrielle were in her room, along with other girls they knew from school. Skylynn wasn't sitting with them, saying she was "too cool to be hanging out with the losers at the bottom of the school food chain". None of the girls minded.
Sky sat on the couch extremely bored, until something buzzed. She quickly got up, and fished out a phone from the bottom of the couch.
Sky had never intended to see what she saw.
But the events that continued were all intended and planned.
