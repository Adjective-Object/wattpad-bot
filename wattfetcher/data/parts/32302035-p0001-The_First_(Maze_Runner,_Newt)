What if Teresa wasn't the first girl to arrive at the Glade? What if after a few months Alby was sent  to the Glade and a girl was the second? ------------------------Madison was the second to come after Alby and the first girl to arrive. She only remembered her name and one foggy memory of a boy.
Newt was the third to come and as well remembered his name and a foggy memory of a girl. ------------------------This will be my first book so there might be a few errors and thank you so much if your reading.
