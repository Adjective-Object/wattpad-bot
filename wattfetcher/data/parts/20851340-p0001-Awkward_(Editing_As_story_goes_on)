Hello, My name Is Skye Lites. I'm 17. I go to Highland Park High School. I'm pretty much Really shy. I don't have any friends actually. Moving past my Details.
I walked into The school building today, and everybody was talking about 'New kids' coming Tomorrow. I tried listening through some of the Chatting in the halls. After reaching my locker I opened it up and heard Chat's in the back of me.
"I CAN'T BREATHE TO THE THOUGHT OF PIERCE THE VEIL BECOMING STUDENTS HERE. I MEAN. MIKE IS SO HOT" I heard a fangirl say behind me. Pierce the veil.. was coming to this school. My eyes widened.. I was freaking out on the inside.
I went to art class after most of my classes. Guess what I was drawing.. Yes.. Pierce the veil.. After I had more time. I drew Vic Fuentes.. Only him in the sketch.. I had hearts all around Him. Yeah.. I was in love with him.. Like head over heals with him. Even though I don't wear heals..
After the bell rang I went to my locker and grabbed my skateboard..
I just ran out of the building, And started riding on my Skateboard. Later I knew I was so lose to my street. Then I saw that it was a red light. I starting riding again.. Next thing I know.. I'm on the ground.. Throbbing in pain. My vision was all blurry. My body wouldn't move. That was when I passed out on the ground.

I woke up. I was in some bed. I looked around with still some blurry vision. My head was still throbbing. Somebody walked in. I gasped. "Where am I" I asked the Man. "You are in the hospital, Miss. Lites." He explained to me. "You got hit by a car." He told me, Then I looked around more. I felt my head. Some strange women walked into the room. "Oh my! Skye You scared me to death!" She said. "Who are you?" I asked her. She looked at me with tears in her eyes. It's me... Dawn.. You're Sister."
---- Weeks after...
"I'm gonna go for a walk" I said. I grabbed my coat and put on some Vans. Then I walked right out the door. I walked into a valley. There was no Light. It was snowy though. Then... I bumped into some guy. "OW! Watch it!" I screamed.
