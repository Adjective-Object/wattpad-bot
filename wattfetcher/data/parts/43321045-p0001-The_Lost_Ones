If you didn't understand the description basically this is going to be a an entire page of what my story will be about, if you did understand it you can just go ahead to the next page (aka the first chapter) so here's what this story 'The Lost Ones' is about.
The main characters name is Grace (pretty basic I know, no offense readers with the name grace) and when these children at first born the government pretty much already knows who you'll end up with, their also the ones who name you. So basically Grace ends up not having a match and is considered one of 'the lost ones'.
And that's all you need to know for now :-))))) !
The main characters are Grace and A special someone, you guessed it, you know it, Harry Styles :))).
No, I dont have a specific star to play the role of Grace so for now you can imagine her.
And harry is harry styles obviously.
Please enjoy this story and i'd appreciate if you gave as much feedback as possible as well .
