Once Harry got to Louis he looked down at him, as he was much taller, with a gigantic smile and twinkling eyes. Louis had to look up to meet his green eyes with his blue ones, with a similar smile on his face. "Hi." Harry said. "Hey." Louis said. He smiled at Harry one last time before connecting their lips in one of the best kisses Louis ever had.
When they pulled apart, everyone clapped and cheered. Harry opened his eyes after Louis still in complete bliss, to meet Louis'. They forgot all about everyone around them, just smiling at each other, Louis' hand's still cupping his cheeks. "How did you kn-" Harry was cut off by Louis holding up the sheet of paper full of things he didn't know about Harry. "Oh," Harry said, "Oh!" Harry said more startled this time, knowing how he got a little 'off topic' while writing it. He tried to grab it but Louis wasn't having it so he ran off. "Nope! I already read it anyways Haz!" Harry smiled, Louis even knew his nickname. He really did pay attention.
Harry ran after Louis his long legs helping but not helping enough. Louis was on the football team, for god's sake's. Louis finally turned a corner, slowing him down enough for Harry to catch up. Harry through his arms around Louis' waist lifting him off the ground a bit. They were laughing and just being them. Harry put Louis down, grabbing the paper and put it above Louis' reach. "Heyyyy. No fair." Louis said jumping up to try and get it. Harry didn't say anything, but pointed to his lips asking for another kiss. Louis saw and winked at him, giving him a peck.
"Do you want to be my boyfriend Harry?" Louis asked after. Harry dropped his arm, and smiled so big his jaw started to hurt. "Yes, yes, yes! A million times yes!" Harry said, "I mean, ahem, yes." Harry smiled sheepishly. Louis smiled at the dork, his dork. "You're such a dork Harry, my dork." Louis smirked. "Yeah, you're dork." And Harry smirked too.
And that was that.
