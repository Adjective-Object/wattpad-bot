I remember my life before those green eyes waltzed in and changed my being for the better. Before I tell you that story I have to explain mine. My name is Castiel Novak I am twelve years old and I go to Lawrence jr high. Before things get all confusing in this story let me just tell you that I'm an angel of the lord and I was sent down to earth to be like humans and observe them. So as I was saying Dean Winchester well before he came into our town I would spend my days as a fifth grader reading and writing Johnlock on my laptop. Then at the start of my sixth grade year I noticed a new kid standing proud and walking a smaller being to a kindergarten class.  I couldn't keep my eyes of this being. his soul was so bright and beautiful, and those eyes they looked liked perfect emeralds bestowed onto his perfect face. as the beautiful boy looked up he caught me staring, so he ran up to me and said, "hello my name is Dean Winchester." and brought his hand up for me to shake, so I politely reached up and shook his hand and I swore there was something that started when our hands were together for that short period of time. I told him my name after I dropped his hand and asked, "what class are you in?" he replied, "I'm in Mrs.Welchez class, what about you?" I quickly nodded and said " I'm in her class as well." he nodded and asked if I wanted to walk with him to class so I said yes.
and this is where our story begins.!
