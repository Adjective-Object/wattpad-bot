"And what if he doesn't. What if he does something else with those dinosaurs? Do you think these powerful animals are going to be honestly looked at as a food source?

Theo frowned. "I only wanted to help Dad."
Owen sighed. "I know...you have a big caring heart just like your mother." he hugged Theo.
Theo didn't hug him back as he stood with guilt.
"There's more you need to know..."
Owen pulled away from him. "What?"
"I invited Mr. Segura to the island to get the supplies he needed to start."
Owen squeezed with bridge of his nose with a grunt. "Well, they won't get past our radar system."
Theo just looked at him.
"Fuck Theo!" Owen said angrily grabbing his radio and alerting the island.
"Let's go!" He said pulling him by his arm to the car. "After this, I swear you're grounded forever."

Alan was sitting reading the newspaper in his lunge chair when Ellie's phone went off . Ellie hurried into the room.
"It's Keira again." she smiled before answering it. "Hello?"
"Did she miss us that much?" Alan joked but he watched as his wife's smiled faded and her face drained of all colour.
"Alan!" She ran over and pressed the speaker button. The reception was broken but they could hear their daughter struggling and yelling as a man spoke to her.
Alan's face stricken with anger. "I'm getting real tired of people messing with my family."

Lowery saw incoming boats coming to the island and fast. He attempted to radio but the doors of the control center opened and everyone in the room was at gun point.
"Not again." Lowery groaned.
