The scene changed yet again.
But this...this time... It was Italy, Germany, Japan and Prussia. Oh..this...
"Ve~ It's really here~" Italy said.
"I thought it was just a rumour...I never thought we would actually find it..." Japan admitted.
Prussia smirked and marvelled at the mansion. "It has such a desolate feel... Not bad."
(Oh...)
(This memory...)

And then the screen faded out.
After that, I was able to move again. I went back to the others before Japan did.
"...I think I'll go back to the others." Japan said to himself.
When Japan got back, the others were talking about a different matter.
"That's why I'm saying that this piece of paper might be a hint to some kind of hidden passage!" Germany pressed.
Japan tilted his head and asked, "Um, what? Now your priority is deciphering that password?"
Russia nodded. " Pretty much~ It looks like everyone decided that the other problem was too difficult and that we should first solve this, open the safe to find out what's inside...
And then give it some careful thought."
"Wait. Then someone's phone should have rung one more time. Shouldn't we wait for it?" China suggested them.
England squinted his eyes and spoke, "How can our phones even get calls if we're out of range? Besides, we don't even know who has been calling us. Should we blindly trust the hints they give us?"
"I'm getting a little hungry..." Italy said as his rubbed his stomach slowly.
Germany turned to his friend. "What are you looking like that for? Toughen up. Be strong."
I quickly opened my bag and grabbed a few biscuits. "Here, have some of these Italy."
"Uwaa~ Grazie, bella!" Italy said happily.
Aside from Italy's munching, everyone else were quiet. I knew what was going to happen next. Germany's phone was going to ring and---
A loud ring was heard.
"H-Huh...?" My eyes widened.
I felt something in my pocket vibrate. No way. My phone. It was my phone that was ringing! I took it out of my pocket.
"...There it is. _____, answer it please." Canada asked politely.
I nodded and looked back on the screen of my phone nervously. " .....Right. I'll put it on speaker."
A sound of a piano was heard.
"... It was a piano, after all." Japan said in a low voice.
Russia spoke up. "Yep. Now, let's put the notes we heard together."
"The note we just heard was Si." I told them.
England spoke, "The note I got was Re."
"The note I heard? It was... Sol." Russia said.
We all turned to Italy who was in some sort of daze.
