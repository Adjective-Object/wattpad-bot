"Rose, whoever you are thinking of killing right now isn't worth your time, you must stay put okay?" Mr.Arnold asked from the other side of the door.
I smiled. I felt insane, the sanity inside me became like a lost child amidst a gang of criminals. The smile however turned back into a deathly scowl.
"I will kill him."
In that very moment, I freed myself from the ball I was in. In flash I jumped off the window. If you think I am that trained then don't flatter yourself, the dorms are only one floor.
I jumped off and ran as much my legs could carry me into the training room.
I ran to the cubicles and then looked at the gun on the table. Finally, you come in usage. I thought to myself.
I took slow steps toward the gun and wrapped my fingers around the sleek black object. I looked at it in satisfaction.
Wasting no more time. I went to the underground area, I looked around looking for a living soul in the hallway but found none. Then I heard some muffled voices.
"General Eric what do...."
