"A-Austin." He moaned holding my shirt a little tighter and tilting his head to the side giving me more space. Another moan escaped his lips before he pulled my head away and I smiled admiring my work.  "Do you know how fucking sexy you are?" He said brushing my hair back.
"I think I know." I said smirking. I went to kiss him but the bus door opened and the guys were talking up a storm. I groaned and rested my head on his shoulder.
"Come on maybe we can do something later." He offered and grabbed my hand pulling me to the front.
"Hey." Alan said to everyone. They all stopped and looked at him before laughing. "What!?"
"Baby your neck." I said.
He groaned before walking off. I saw Kellin and Vic and raised an eyebrow.
"Why are you guys here?" I asked.
"I'm getting the prints from Alan." Vic said, "and he tagged along." He gestured to Kellin.
"Oh you can head on back." I said bringing them back while he was on the phone.  He was smiling a little and laughing before looking at me and smiling before walking out of the bunks to the back. He shut the door and I followed listening him talk with Kellin and Vic behind me.
"Roy n- I'm with someone else- really you're calling a slut? Seriously!?" He said getting angry, "Why the hell did I get paired with you. You're just some asshole who- fuck you! I'm not a whore! You fucking prick-" He shouted before I heard him throw his phone.
I opened the door and saw him sitting there looking up at the ceiling with an angry expression.
"Babe?" I said and sat next to him running a hand through his hair. "You okay?" I asked and he bit his lip nodding.
"Yeah I just have an asshole of a partner." He muttered.
"Your partner is Roy?" Kellin asked crinkling his nose and Alan nodded. "God I fucking hate that asshole!" He said.
"You're not the only one." I muttered and looked back down at my boyfriend, "What was he saying to you?"
"He was calling me a slut because I moved on! Apparently I'm a whore too and a whiney bitch who will only find people who will use him and cheat on him." He mumbled looking down at his fingers, "He's such an asshole. He wants me back too but that's not happening either.  I can't believe I loved him. Nearly three years of my life I'll never get back. God I'm such an idiot."
"No you're not." I said taking his hand in mine.
"The only idiot is that asshole. If you want I can get rid of him for you," Kellin said. "I know a guy."
"Babe, how do you know a guy?" Vic asked looking at his boyfriend.
"Don't ask questions.
"No he's the only way I can get graded for this project." Alan said, "So for now he's kind of important."
"Alright fine, but the guy I know would have kicked his ass for you."
"Yes I know that Kellin but no."
"Okay, okay." He muttered.
"Anyway what are you two doing here?"
"Prints, you told me to come pick some up and he wanted to come with," Vic said pointing at Kellin.
"Right one sec." Alan said getting up and walking to his old bunk.
