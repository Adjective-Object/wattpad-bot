Schools on again. Monday. Yay! If you can't hear the sarcasm in my voice you must really be an idiot.
A/N don't take that personally. It's just Levi's personality.
I ride the bus with ass heads. Screaming and yelling like idiots. I put I put in my head phones and listen to fall out boy. I push the black hair falling in my face to the side. Before the song is over Hanji jumps into the seat with me. "Hiiiii Leevvvvii~!" She sings.  I roll my eyes and grunt. "Hello Hanji." She pulls an earbud out of my ear. "Ooh!! Fall out boy!!~ WOOHOO!!" She punches the air and I can't help but crack a smile.
We finally get to school. As I walk I see that Jaegar kid. I wave at him and he waves back with a blush. I smile really wide and luagh quietly. I walk over to him and lightly punch his arm. "See you in Spanish class brat." He rolls his eyes. "See you there shorty." I freeze and grab his arm. "What'd you call me brat?" I say coldly. "Shorty?" He say with a gulp. "That's what I thought." I pull chin towards me. "Don't talk to me that way Brat. Got it?" I say and he nods.  "Good." I let go and smile. As I walk away I say. "See you in Spanish.....Brat."
As I'm on my way to my next class I see something I wish I dint.  Eren is backing out of a room Mikasa following him. "W-woah M-Mikasa. I k-knew you had feeling for m-me but not like this!" He backs into a wall. Mikasa pins him to it. "Oh come on. You know you like me." She kisses Eren. He blushes madly then gets lost in the kiss. "E-re...E-Eren?" I choke out. His eyes widen and pushes Mikasa off him. I start to run down the hall away from him. "N-NO!! L-LEVI COME BACK!!" He calls after me. I ignore him and run away. Wh-why is my heart b-breaking?? I-I barely even l-like the Brat.  M-Mikasa. Where have I heard that name. Memories flood back....No. NO NO NO NO!!! Mikasa?!?! The name rings in my head as I run to my next class. I look back.  I lost Eren. Yes. I don't know what'd I'd do if I saw the brat. I grunt and turn into my next class.
(Say it was short.)
