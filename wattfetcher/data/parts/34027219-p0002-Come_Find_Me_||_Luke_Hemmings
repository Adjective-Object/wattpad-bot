*MADISON'S POV*
I'm dancing with one of my brother's friends, because my brother actually doesn't let anyone near me who he doesn't know. Then I have to excuse myself and I'm slowly heading to the toilets. When I walk out of the bathroom I see that famous boy standing there. Is he following me or what? I just keep ignoring him and go back to our table. "Hey Maddie" my best friend Sophia immediately wrap her arm around my shoulders. She's obviously drunk. Apparently, I hate when people are calling me Maddie. I like when they call me Madison. "Guess what?" she asks me. "What?" I ask her with a smile on my face, because Sophia being drunk is one of the funniest things ever. "Some guy asks me about your number" she says and I just shake my head. "I gave it to him" she adds."You did what?" I half yell at her. "Shush" she press her index finger on my lips. "He was really cute" she tries to defend herself. Great now some stranger has my number.
