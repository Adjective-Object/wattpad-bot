"look bitch i wouldnt want to fuck with me i know things and i know people so i'd keep my mouth shut if I were you" He said clearly pissed off. All i did was roll my eyes Carter was about to slap me,but because of my smartness i slaped him first. after i done that and realizeed what i'd have done i steped back real fast. Carter had a big red mark on his face he put his hand to his face then called me a bitch.he was beyond pissed nowÂ so of how smart i am i ran away toward my car hopped in and locked the doors.
I started the car I looked back to see if carter was there and to my luck he wasnt thank god.I backed out the parking space and drove home.Now i just have to avoid him at the party.
