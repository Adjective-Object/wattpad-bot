I walked through the door and saw my mum glaring at me in an exciting way. Hmmm what now?
"Mum?"
"Yes!!!"
"Why are you looking at me like that?"
"Your accepted!!"
"What! Shut the front door!!!"
"Your going to NYU!!"
"THANK THE LORD, THIS HAS BEEN MY DREAM FOR YEARS!!"
"Ik!!"
I ran up to my mum and hugged her tight.
I cannot believe this! Im going to NYU! This doesnt happen to people like me. Im just ordinary. What the hell! That sounds weird 'im going to new York university!'
"When?"
"Next week!"
"Flippin hell yassssss!"
"Haha"
I then went upstairs and obviously I had to brag on Facebook, instagram, twitter and all social media. Cause thats me!
I'm so happy right now!
Im going to NYU by myself next week. I'm gonna have a roommate! I bet shes gonna be so cool! Or maybe it will be a he!!!! A fitty!
I feel bad for my mum, cause im an only child and she broke up with dave last month. Shes gonna be all alone! Oh well! Hah!
