Satan : Just do it, take it off, you'll look way better without it.
And I did it ... I took the most precious things off, my hijab .. and my manners.
It was the last day for Simon here in Jordan, I told Karam that I was going to Zainab, he agreed because he was already going out.
I curled my hair, got into tight pants, red shirt and a jeans jacket. I opened YouTube searching for some makeup tutorials, I opened the makeup bag that Zainab gave me and started following the steps.
I drove my car with my red high heels, "Simon, I got a surprise for you, I'll meet you in Tajj Mall" I said, "What? Where is that?" He yawned, he seemed sleepy, "Did I just wake you up? Get dressed darling and just tell the taxi to take you to it", "Okay fine" He hung up.
I parked my car and stepped out of it with my long curled hair that reached my waist, the red lipstick on my lips, my heels that made loud noise between the frozen men checking me from head to toe, girls were glaring at me with envy on their eyes. All eyes were on me, I heard guys whistle, flirt and ask for my number, I must admit that I looked Fab-u-lous, I shooed them off, but others came, one of them said that he wishes to be the lipstick on my lips.
"Where are you Simon?" I called him as I was sitting in a Caff√® with an orange juice in my hand, "I'm in front of Nike store", "Okay, two seconds and I'll be there" I took out my wallet so pay for my juice then I heard someone clear his throat, I looked up and saw a brunett handsome man with crystal green eyes, "Hi" He said, "Can I offer you a drink?" He asked, I was willing to agree, he was HOT, extremely Hot ! But I'm not the kind of girls with 10 boyfriends ! I got Simon and he's way more than enough, "No" I smiled politely and paid my bill then left so meet Simon.
What will he say? Will he like my new look? Will he recognise me? I walked toward the handsome young man with a red shirt that matched my outfit, it was obvious that he was looking for someone, "Hey, handsome, are you free" I winked at him, Simon looked at me and Smile, "I'm sorry, I'm taken" He looked away and kept looking for me, "She's not coming" I said, "Can you please leave me alone" He said as he walked away from me, I exploaded in laughter and he froze in his place then turned around slowly, he walked slowly toward me, "Hi" I said, "You may not believe me but you look like-", "Leena" I cut him off, Simon gasped, "Oh My ... Is that you?" His eyes widened, "Yes, it's me, Leena", "You look gorgeous! I swear I didn'the recognise you ! What happened to your hijab and loose clothes?" A smile was drawn on his face, "Gave them away" I chuckled, "You don't know how much I want to kiss you right now" He grabbed my waist and pulled me closer, "No ! Simon! Not in public" I pushed him away, "Who cares" He said and quickly stole a kiss from my lips, "Want to do something crazy?"I raised an eyebrow, "I want to do something wild, it's my last day here" He sighed in sadness, "Oh ! Don't be sad you big beautiful cheeky baby" I pinched his cheeks, "Let's go clubbing" I suggested and a devilish smirk was drawn on his perfect face.
.......
I wish I knew .... I wish I understood ... I wish I noticed.
But, How will I ever forget or even forgive ?
Regret Is worthless now.
......
Will she run away before all her brain gets washed? Will she wake up before making mistakes that can't be erased? Will Simon act like an angel and NOT take advantage of her???Maybe,And maybe NOT...
