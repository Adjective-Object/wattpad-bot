Not my picture. ----------------------------------------------Narrators PoV-----------------After the NewYork battle Loki was sent to Asgard only to be sent back by Odin for punishment, Loki was sitting in his cell.
Steve PoV-------------It was my turn to check on Loki because no one else wanted to do it even Thor didn't. I walk down to Loki's cell and looked at him (cell is see through but is strong enough to hold Loki) he still had the muzzle on which worried me a little. After I little while of thinking I decided I would take it off. I opened the door of his cell and Loki didn't even bother to glance at me. I walked over to him and pressed the buttons that removed the muzzle because Loki's hands where handcuffed together so that he couldn't do it himself. When I seen the gods face i gasped long red gashes where along the his face I and the other avengers didn't know about it because the muzzle had hid the gashes. Loki looked up at me with pained eyes. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ That's it for now because I just been skiing and I'm tiered. So tell me if you want more bye!!!!!!!!!! Ps.
