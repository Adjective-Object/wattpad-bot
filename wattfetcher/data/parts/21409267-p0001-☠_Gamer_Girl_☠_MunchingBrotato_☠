My name is Blaze, that's my nickname but ignore that. I'm 17 years old. I have brown hair that's light. I wear beanies often. I cuss, a lot. I am an official 'fangirl' as the younger ones would say. I watch youtube all the time and my mom hates it. I know, I'm a 17 year old girl who hasn't moved out yet. My mom said once I'm 18, which is in a year, I can move out. I'm out of school and I'm on my computer/phone 24/7. I don't hang out with friends, I would if I had any. Then one day I ran into a video on Youtube after watching Call Of Duty content. It was a Minecraft video. I still have no idea how after a Call Of Duty video Minecraft pops up. Anyways, the video was of X's Adventures of Minecraft. I got hooked onto it. Then I started watching more youtubers along the way.
Then I bumped into a youtuber called the name..
'MunchingBrotato'.
Or Tyler of course. Tyler's videos were so funny I tried not to laugh one video but failed. One day he did face cam for the first time. I was shocked on what he looked like and I started drooling. Tyler was so attractive. I remember seeing BajanCanadian but he wasn't attractive. But boy! Tyler was! My world was upside down when I watched him. Everything I love is Tyler, food, and sleep. But, I always tell myself Sleep Is For The Weak, which it is. My life was kinda sad when I was watching Tyler.
Until everything changed when I met him..
