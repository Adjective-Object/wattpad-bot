I: Ant?
A: yeap?
I: do you see that guy in the fugly sweater with the very fake looking cat?
A: yeah. what about him?
I: I think he's watching us.... i feel very uncomfortable and i don't want to be here any longer.
A: he's probably a fan, ignore him! plus, we need to find out if Luna is dying.
I: but Ant, he looks older than my grandma, plus it's making me uncomfortable! i want to get out of here. i want Casey, you, Luna, and me safe.
A: Luna won't live unless we stay.
I: i know....
A: how about this? i go over there, ask the weirdo what his problem is, we get Luna looked over, then we go?
I: o-okay. be careful <3
A: i will. <3 i almost always am.
