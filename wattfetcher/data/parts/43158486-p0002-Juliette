"Chloe, you know how important this dinner is," he pulled my mom closer to him, but even a fool could see how much he was trying not to cave.
"Your father is right. Both of you go upstairs and get ready for tonight," she instructed with a smile. She pecked my father's lips before pulling away and helping out with the preparations for the dinner.
Ashton poked my ribs before hurrying upstairs to claim my shower because his was broken. "Ashton you better not get in my shower!" I yelled, running after him.
"You're too slow for this," he called from over his shoulder before bursting in my room. He went into the bathroom and locked it just a second before I did.
"Can I go first? Please, Ash!" I whined from the other side. I heard the shower turn on and I groaned in frustration.
Exactly twenty minutes later- yes I was counting, he came out with my towel wrapped around his torso. "Ewww! You're dick is touching my towel!" I growled.
"I'm a guy. This is a towel. Suck it up and get a new one," he shrugged with a smirk.
"I'm telling Dad," I threatened while I crossed my arms over my chest.
"While you're at it, tell him about your secret boyfriend," he challenged.
"Toby is not my boyfriend, he's just a friend," I stated.
"Friend my ass," he scoffed. "I've seen you two sneak off..." he countered.
Let's see if he would really be this calm if I were to be sneaking off with Toby. "When did you see us? Was if before or after I had shifted?" I asked with fake shock. His eyes widened and chest seemed to grow timidly.
"What?" He roared.
"I'm joking, Father," I laughed. He growled lowly before grabbing the end of the towel. I shrieked and covered my eyes with my hands.
The towel was thrown at me... in the face. "Ashton!" I cried in horror to which he only answered with a laugh.
Sometimes, having a brother for a twin, is honestly not the best thing in the world.
