And i don't know why i love you but i do and it hurts me a lot.
My heart breaks every time i see you smile to her.
I don't wanna love you.

You came to my life in the wrong moment but... I still love you baby.

When i see you i just want to kiss you, it's a crazy and confuse thing because my mind tells me "don't do that" and my heart push me saying "go ahead take a risk".

I just... I don't want to feel this anymore.
