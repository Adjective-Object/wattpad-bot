The truth is nothing matters,
The truth is one day everything we've gotten accustomed to will come crashing down,
The truth is that the blades of the once un-shattered pure glass you called your life,
Will never hesitate to cut open your dream and mercilessly toss you into the cruelty we call reality.
The truth is love holds nothing but an empty promise of torture.
Or maybe that only seems to be truth grieve blinds us with,
Maybe allowing ourselves to comprehend that the vision we see be no more than a mirage enforced onto us by sadness,
Will light a flame so mighty onto our paths and we will be no more than the power that controls this blaze Â of glory.
The truth is what we see.
What we see manipulates our reality.
Our reality is a war zone and we be no more than loaded weapons waiting to go off and end our purpose.
