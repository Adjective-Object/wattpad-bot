Ross - Why?
Ariana - Well you obviously dont trust me
Ross - Maybe if you didn't sleep with Riker I wouldn't have been upset!
Ariana - Well maybe if you didn't sleep with Alexa I wouldn't have slept with Riker!
Ross - What?
Ariana - That's right, i know that you had sex with my sister. You guys weren't drunk or anything, you just did it. If you hadn't ditched me at the club, maybe I wouldn't have been drunk and maybe I wouldn't have slept with Riker, so dont act like its all me Ross, this is all your fault!
How does she know about that?, I told Alexa to not tell anyone.
Ross - I'm sorry
Ariana - Look, I just need some space right now, I'm taking Riley to the park
Ross - Arian--
Ariana - Just..give me some time. Ok?
Ross - Alright
And then she walked out of the room with Riley
