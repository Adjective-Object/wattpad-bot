Looking around the petshop, your (eye color) orbs landed on a huge bundle of snow white fur that was currently napping away, peacefully. The fluff of the creature caught your attention quickly, and you couldn't help but tap on the cage it rested in.
As soon as you did, cold ice blue eyes met your own. It gave you an irritated glare as if it was mad that you dared to its interrupt resting. The glare it gave didn't bother you in the slightest, in fact, you did it again just to get another reaction.
This time, the huge fluff got up and stretched. You let out a small 'aw' when you realized it wasn't as big as you thought it was, just its fur giving off the illusion.
From the side of you, a coworker whom was placed to help you coughed loudly, gaining your attention.
"Ah I see this little guy got your attention."
You nodded and tapped at the cage again, which made the cat send you another unamused look. You smiled
"I'll take him!"
Again, the coworker caughed then scratched her head.
"A-are you sure? That cat is weird..anyone who adopts it always returns it. The previous owners always have a scared look when they do, saying it was a huge mistake. We're actually thinking about putting him down. Sure he's a cute kitten but with those types of stories, we have no choice."
Hearing this made you lift your eyebrow towards the feline, who was pawing away at his tail. You couldn't believe the story, more like you refused to believe it.
"Yep, I'm sure."
The coworker was astonished by your bold tone in your voice, but none the less gathered the paper work which you signed. Afterwards, the woman grabbed a wooden kennel and gently placed the kitten in there as if it was glass. You reached for the kennel but she slapped your hand, stopping you
"Are you sure about this?"
You nodded "yes"
".. alright, good luck"
You took the kennel and waved a goodbye to the workers and other pets hoping that they too, would find a home for themselves.
