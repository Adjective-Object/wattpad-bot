Beep!
Beep!
I picked up my alarm clock and threw it at the wall next to my bed.
Bee- Smash!
Groaning I got out of my bed. Grabbing my phone I looked at the time, 6:20 A.M.
Why am I up this early on a Saturday?!?!!? I thought as I got out of bed.
"Robin!" Sara yelled from downstairs.
I now have a official grudge on the person who came up with school.... I thought as I sleepwalked downstairs.
"Yea." I replied once I was in the kitchen.
"I never thought it would come to this, but we need to get you depression pills..." Sara informed me as I just stared at her like she had three heads.
"Are you insane?!? I don't need pills to get better, the therapy has been going perfectly fine!!!" I yelled furious that Sara thinks I need pills to get rid of a mental disorder. She pinched the bridge of her nose, she must have a headache.
"Listen to me, you need to get better. To get better you have to take depression pills." She told me as if I was a small child. I shook my head at her.
"I can't do this right now..." Was all I said before running up the stairs to my bedroom. My heart is pounding in my ears, I run over to my phone. After turning it on I get onto Wattpad. Next I click on Black_Raven192's profile and I type;
I can't do this.
Yes, you can. I know you will be alright...
I don't want to live anymore, so I guess this is goodbye.
Robin! Don't please, I love you. Don't do this to me, to you... please.I looked at my phone as the monster spoke inside me.
He doesn't care about you! No one cares. Why don't you kill yourself?!?
I hate myself.. I thought as I found a pencil sharpener, taking out the blade I held it in my hand. I suddenly felt like I needed to cut, I want to cut. I slid the blade across my wrist and watched as the dark red blood pools.
I don't feel any pain, just relief....
