Hey guys!!! It's Rainbow again!!! Today I am here to tell Elsa off!!! Yeah you heard me. Elsa has ripped off someone!!! Specifically, Coldplay!!! In their song, Fix You, they said "when love someone too much to let them go", over emphasizing the let them go. How could you Elsa?! *fake sobs* After all we've been through!!! We let it go!!! We built a snowman!!! Just kidding!!! I really don't care about this stuff!!! I am just congratulating Frozen on still being popular after a year. And I listening to Coldplay. So yeah. THERE ARE RAINBOWS EVERYWHERE NOW!!!! - <3 Coldplay (Jk it's Rainbow)
