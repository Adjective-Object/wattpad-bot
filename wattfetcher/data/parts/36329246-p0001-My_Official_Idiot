And just a reminder that this is an exo fanfic based on Chanyeol and dedicated to my friend, so i hope she likes it and i really want this book to be a success.XOXOXO
PROLOGUE:
"Okay class today we have a new student please make him feel welcome."
After that sentence was heard from the teacher i zoned out of the conversation and put my headphones on, Turned it on full blast and looked out the window only to hit on the back of the head about 2mins later by the teacher.
*whack*Affer getting hit i quickly out of reflex take my headpjomes off to hear the loud obnoxious shoutjng of the oh so annoying teacher herself."HEY PARK MINYOUNG, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND PAY ATTENTION"
"Ouch" i say as i scowl and rub my head with annoyance."As punishment for not listening you will give Chanyeol a tour of the school during lunchtime. Oh and next time you dont pay attention your going to the principals office."
"WHAT???~"
"And your moving a seat up since the one infront of you is emty, because chanyeol needs to sit at the back row because he is taller than you".

As I stand infront of everyone i smile big and introduce myself. Many girls stare at me and look in aww, i would say all but thats not true because only one isn't she has her headphones on and is looking out the window. As i watch her i notice she looks very pretty. And i mean the prettiest I've ever seen.
I wonder if we can be friends.
As i think that my smile grows wider as i talk. Tch....I probably look like an idiot.
