Since 5 a.m., With you and your voice sounding like Home, I've been wishing I could bottle up the feelings of all night/early morning. I looked out my window to see darkness, I looked out my window to see dawn, I looked out my window to see the miles between, I looked out my window all night long. But morning came bitterly. I am growing tired of myself, As I wish I could slip away back into the night. The dark is where I am comfortable. I looked through the pages to see angst, I looked through the pages to see poetry, I looked through the pages to see ink, I looked through the pages to read about me. - (m.m) Idk do you guys like this or was the pattern too all over the place?
