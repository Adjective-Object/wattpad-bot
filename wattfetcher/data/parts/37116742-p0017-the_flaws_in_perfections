my plan was flawless the dosage sure to stop my heart a dead body pure
she made me hesitate i stopped to think then i took her compassionand dropped pills in the sink
if i would have done it a painless demise this all could be over the decision to stop i still despise
someday ill do it unknown is the cause that day will come i won't stop to pause
a blade on my wrist prescriptions down my throat a rope on my neck
someday ill be gone
