Heathers POV
The halls blasted music as the men were disgusting. I hated Gerard and the way he would treat the women with disrespect. I thought I would be delighted on my 10th birthday but unfortunately it would the worse day ever. I walked downstairs to see Gerard. His jet black hair hung infront of his face as he talked to a very short man. I approached with caution only to stop short from their conversation. "Here's the birthday girl." Gerard said. He grabbed my arm and shoved me towards the man.
"Heather this is Frank and he will be taking you somewhere nice." He said. Frank smiled at me warmly but I could tell he was a Vampire. Frank reached out and grabbed my hand and led me to a black car.
"Where are we going?" I asked as he shoved me into the backseat. Without words he punched me and got into the car. The inside of the car was spinning as I blacked out.
