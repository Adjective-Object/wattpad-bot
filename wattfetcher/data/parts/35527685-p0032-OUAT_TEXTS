LiteralBae : Is anyone else hoping to be ressurected?
QueenOfHearts : Why do you ask?
LiteralBae : Because people keep coming back to life. Zelena, my father, Maleficent. It's not fair.
QueenOfHearts : Well deadbeat what do you have to live for?
LiteralBae : Emma, my son...
QueenOfHearts : Well Henry has gotten along just fine without you and Emma is with the pirate. If you didn't know that...
LiteralBae : So
QueenOfHearts : So they are not going to waste that much power on you.
PeterPan : And they won't use it on Cora or myself because well we would obliterate them.
QueenOfHearts : true up top!
PeterPan: *high fives*
LostBoy: No one even remembers me :(
PeterPan: You're not memorable. Franklin was it?
LostBoy :Come on Pan! I was your only true friend. You killed me to enact your curse!
PeterPan : Huff well when Phoebe is done being dramatic we should continue our conversation.
QueenOfHearts : Yes now who would they ressurect?
TazerT: Not me
OwenGreg:Not me
QueenOfHearts : Obviously...
HuntsMan: Me!!!
QueenOfHearts: And you are?
HuntsMan: Graham...the sheriff...your daughter killed me after I broke up with her...
QueenOfHearts : Oh your that wolf boy that cheated on my daughter with that Swan girl.
Huntsman: Yeah!
QueenOfHearts : Well no one has thought about you in years...My daughter and Miss Swan have both moved on.
Huntsman: ...NVM
QueenOfHearts : That's what I thought.
PeterPan: Well I guess they killed us off for a reason.
QueenOfHearts: We should make our own show! Once upon a time after death.
PeterPan : I'M IN!!!
LiteralBae: let's do this thing!
QueenOfHearts: We didn't invite you...
PeterPan: let's hope they kill Emma. She'd make a great addition to our show!
LiteralBae: NO!!!!!!!
PeterPan:Fine then I will be the star!
QueenOfHearts : No I will be!
LostBoy: Oh boy...
PeterPan: SHUT UP PHOEBE!
