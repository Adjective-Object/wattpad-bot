This is to all the Hetalia fans out there. So, you know how Austria and Germany always argue over where Beethoven came from, right?
I checked Wikipedia (don't judge me.) and it said that Beethoven was born somewhere in the Holy Roman Empire. What significance does this fact have?
Well, earlier, I looked up and tried to see if HRE becomes Germany at one point and it turns out that some of HRE's territories were what is considered Germany today, so basically, Beethoven is German.
