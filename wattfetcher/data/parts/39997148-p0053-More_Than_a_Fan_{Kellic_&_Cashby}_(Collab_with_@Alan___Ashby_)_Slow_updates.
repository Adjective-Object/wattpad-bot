"Yeah! Now go apologize." Tony said pointing at the bunks.
"Okay I will." I said getting up and walking back to the bunks. I made my way to Kellins bunk where it was full of little sniffles like he was trying to quit crying. "Hey Kellin."
"Shit, uh one second." He said his voice cracking a little. I leaned against the wall and waited for him. He pushed open the curtains and looked up at me and I immediately felt like a total dick.
"Look I'm sorry for being an asshole out there."
Kellin sniffed, "It's whatever."
"No, I was being a total dick to you."
"It's okay, they were making you angry. I completely understand, besides why would you even like someone like me? I'm just some little fan or whatever." He said wiping at his eyes.
"I actually do like you, I just can't start anything right now." I told him honestly.
"Why? I mean you don't have to answer but well I-I'm kinda curious."
"A few weeks ago I got out of a bad relationship."
"Oh gross." He said scrunching his nose.
"Yeah it sucks, especially because I really loved her. Or well I thought I did at least." I told him and he patted the mattress motioning for me to sit down which I did.
"What did she do?"
"She cheated on me."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"It's not your fault that she did it. Everyone in the band well not even just in the band- everyone hated her. Even my parents but well like I said I loved her."
"You must have really loved her if you didn't care what everyone else thought about her."
"I really, really did." I told him, "When we first started dating she was amazing and nice and everything I could have wanted but like five months ago that all started to change and I was too in love with her to really notice. But Cara's not important right now-"
"Oh Cara! I've seen pictures of you two on instagram!" He said laughing, "All of the fans hate her so much. And from what I saw she didn't really seem very nice."
"She was really great at one point."
Kellin shook his head, "I always thought she was with you for your fame. But you were happy so that's all that mattered."
I laughed, "Now you sound like all the fan who comment on my pictures with her."
He blushed, "Once or twice."
"Oh my god." I said shaking my head, "As long as you're not one of those weird fuenciado shippers we're fine. I don't think I can like someone who ships me with my best friend."
"No, no, gross."
"Thank god!" I said in relief. "Fuenciado shippers are so gross! It's just I mean if they met Jaime they would understand."
"Dude have you smelled the bathroom?" Kellin asked, "And his bunk is right over mine and his feet fucking stink!"
"You get used to these things after knowing him for long, let alone touring with him."
"It's terrible." He said just as the bus stopped.
"I thought we had another hour before we got there." I said frowning and got up. "One sec." I told him and hurried to the front. "Hey why'd we stop?"
