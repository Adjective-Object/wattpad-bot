18 year old Ariel Diesel was feeding her new born daughter London. It had a day since she had given birth and so many people wanted to know what gender she had, who the father was or what the baby name was.
Ariel liked her privacy and didn't release any information out to the public.
Everybody knew who she was because she once dated Matthew Espinosa. Their relationship was full of ups an downs and mostly fights.
But they loved eachother at the end of the day. Ariel actually thought they would be together forever.
But until she found that she was pregnant. She was so scared and nervous to tell Matt.
So that's why she decided not to tell him because she didn't want to ruin his career.
So she left without a reason or a goodbye.
But only she would know and no one else would know that.
He was the Baby Daddy. ----------------------------------------
My first Matthew Espinosa story. If you don't like him then oh well. I'm trying something knew. No hate.
