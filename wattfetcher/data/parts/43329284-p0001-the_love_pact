~SPOV~"niggah lets go skating its boring here,and i need my mind off of this shit." i said to Aramis to break the silence while we sat in my living room/kitchen. My dad past exactly a year ago and todays the day he passed. "Aight man fosure" Aramis said pulling me out of my thoughts. "Lets go" we got our boards and road to the skate park around the corner, my escape to my wonderland ,escape from this pathetic world. While we were riding something caught my attention it was a huge crowd i walked over leaving Aramis behind at the gate, while i got closer i can hear people yelling "fight,fight,fight!" i shoved my way to the front and saw Andrea? 'shit!' i said under my breathe ,some other girl was on top of her throwing punches from left to right, DAMN. i thought to my self. Andrea was my ex girlfriend i broke up with her because she used me for my fame and said she was "pregnant" just so i can stay with her but she really wasn't. "Andrea!" i screamed i ran and tried pulling the other girl off of her i did but i fell with her and landed on top of her. her ryes were a hazel and her hair was a dirty blonde she had the most beautiful body. Gotta love my booty. And she had little freckles and the cutest dimples even if she wasn't smiling you can still see them. "Uhm.. excuse me your a little heavy" she pulled me out of my thoughts admiring her features. "Oh shit sorry" i said not wanting to get of and just wanting to smash my lips on hers, wait wtf?! i love Andrea yeah she used me, but i love her i thought as i slowly got off of her wait whats her name? ,and her number ugh Steven stop! "You know i didn't need your help i had it myself" she said. "Sorry bout that, you new?" i asked gesturing to a bench for her to sit. "Uh, yeah she chuckled i just moved here today actually" i nodded and asked "so how did you get in a fight with Andrea anyways?" her eyes widened and her face filled with a grin "Oh so thats that bitch's name she chuckled again wich made me let out a little laugh her dimples showing every time she spoke or smiled,well i was playing skate with this guy i just met his names Aaron and i won and we started talking and she came up to me and called me a hoe and to stay away from Aaron or else i was ganna get my ass beat she chuckled, well i guess her words back fired on her because i beat the shit out of her slutty ass cake face, we both laughed. "Ah i see,wait so she moved on?" i said reassuring myself "what?" "oh uhm, nothing, so whats your name?" i said hoping to get a number along with that i smiled to my self? why? idk. "hello??" she said bringing me out of my thoughts again "oh yeah uhm whats your name again?" "Sarah, my names Sarah" she said showing her deep dimples as she talked. DAMN.
