{ Michael's p.o.v.} The boys and I are going to the music room to practice our new song.  "Do you think it's a good song?" Cal asks kind of nervously. " it's alright I guess" Ash says, he doesn't really like it "I love it" Luke says proudly " of course you do Luke you wrote it !" I yell " he's got a point" " yeah dude " Cal and Ash agree " whatever lets just-" Luke starts but is interrupted when we get closer to the music room by someone singing.  " Let's cause a little trouble .Oh you make me feel so weak.I bet you kiss your knuckles.Right before they touch my cheek "     The voice was beautiful and so was the piano. I've never heard the song before though.  " wow who is that" I ask " I don't know lets find out " Ash says as he opens the door. We are all shocked to she it was Lily. She didn't notice us until she looked up. She had tears on her cheek and in her eyes. " U-um I-i was just uh l-leaving" she said getting up but before she could leave Luke grabbed her arm quite tight seeing as she winced at the pain.  " Hold on slut. Did you write that song?" Luke asked a little harshly "um y-y-yes " she stuttered   " Those are some weird fucking lyrics who are they about? Your old boy toy you slut? Was he abusive ? I would be too if I was your boyfriend I mean how else do you deal with a slut like you!?" Luke says " WHOS IT ABOUT HUH?!" Ash asked She tephra started crying . We've never made her cry before. We've beat her up like once but she didn't cry. She got lose off his grip and ran out as the last bell of the day rang.
