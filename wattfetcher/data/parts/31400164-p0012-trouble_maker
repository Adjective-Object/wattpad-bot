Melodys povSo roc picked me up and we arrived at the party the smell of weed was ever where it was crazy he asked me if I wanted to go dance so I said yes We danced for awhile and then it got boring I asked him to show me the bathroom sense it was his friends house but the first bathroom we went into had people throwing up then the next one was tipcal people were having sex in there so we went upstairs to a room because all I needed was a mirror  roc told me we were in the guest bed room it didn't have a bathroom but it had a mirror we didn't wanna go back down because we herd the cops giving people tickets for the crazy amount of weed so we hid in the closet it was really squished in there The cops didn't leave yet so we jumped out the window and into his car and went to his house when we were there I letirlly fell asleep on the couch but I woke up at 3 in his bed he was up on his phone I just looked at him then he looked at me scared it was funny after that we just stayed up watching movies
