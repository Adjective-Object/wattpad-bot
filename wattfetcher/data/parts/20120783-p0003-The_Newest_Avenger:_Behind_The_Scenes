"Hello, you must be Alexis"
"Uh, yes. I'm Alexis. It's an honour to meet you Mr. Downey"
"And it's an honour to meet you Alexis. Shall we get started?"
"We shall"
What just happened? Was this real? I couldn't believe that happened. I kept thinking these questions, but I got cut off when Joss asked me to read through a scene with Robert Downey Jr. ROBERT. DOWNEY. JR.
I knew I had to put all my effort and more into this scene. Luckily for me, I did just that. Joss handed me a purple card afterwards, and I awaited my final fait.
It only took about 10 minutes for everyone to finish and to be seated quietly. The same man walked in and had the same announcement as before.
"If you have a pink card, we thank you for coming and we ask that you leave. If you have a purple card, please stay."
I looked around the room and saw that everyone was leaving. I was the only one with a purple card.
"Hi, my name is Joss Whedon. Congratulations Alexis, you got the part."
