Yeah I forgot to say happy thanksgiving yesterday
So happy thanksgiving
Unless you don't celebrate that
Then"Happy random Thursday!"
And today's Black Friday
The day where people kill others for TVs
After the day they are  supposed to be thankful of course
Well I'm not going to Black Friday
I feel like tht would be very rude
