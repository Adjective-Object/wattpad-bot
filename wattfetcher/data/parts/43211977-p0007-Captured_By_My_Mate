In the forest lost I walk until I cant walk anymore then there is a voice in my head saying "stop!that is the border" I questioned myself "whaaaattt?" My phone pings and I view it to see Ethan having these texts
Ethan-where are you?I'm sorry of what I didHey respond to me!I know your in the woods I Always know where you are!
You- fuck you you slut you never give me privacy
Ethan-sorry it's just...
He pins me to a tree "i miss you" he kisses me as I push away he doesn't stop and he continues I bite his lip and he bleeds I continue to walk not caing and all of a sudden he tilts my neck to the side and bites down
I scream
"I'm sorry I bit you!" I scream as I lose consciousness and I faint.
