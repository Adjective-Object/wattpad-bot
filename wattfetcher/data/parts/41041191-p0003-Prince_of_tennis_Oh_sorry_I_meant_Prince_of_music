Its was early Saturday morning for the seigaku boys tennis regulars as for they as in they only have practice this morning while others don't.

At the Echizen house hold one young freshmen were rushing to get to practice.

"Why didn't you wake me up baka oyaji now I'm going to be late"Yelled the young super rookie freshmen yelling at his stupid father.

He had ran out side the house before his father can answers.

This young Rookie regular freshmen is non other the prince of tennis Echizen Ryoma.

When Ryoma have ran outside he was greeted by his senpai on his bike waiting for him. "Your late Echizen"The senpai said.

"Aren't you late too"Ryoma replied coldly at him. "Yeah yeah"

This senpai is Momoshiro Takeshi second year regular at seigaku boys tennis team and uses dynamic play.*whispers*he also can eat a lot also Ryoma despite being a midget.

The two rode all the way to the school.Sharing a little conversation(hardly Momo did most of the talking while Ryoma was there give small answer or nods and all). "Hey did you know why oba-chan wanted us to practice on the weekend"Asked Momo.

Ryoma shrugged not really knowing."Will Fuyu and Liam be there"Asked Ryoma.


Who were Fuyu and Liam?Well Fuyu is Ryoma cousin from Canada while Liam is the tennis club captain cousin who also is from Canada and is friends with Him.HER.HIM uhhhhhhh nevemindwhatjusthappened.

"No. I dont think so, they did leave to Canada a week ago"Answered Momo.
