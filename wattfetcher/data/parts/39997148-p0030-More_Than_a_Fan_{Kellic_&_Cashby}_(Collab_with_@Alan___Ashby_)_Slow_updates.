"Have any of you ever thought that maybe I'm just not interested in getting in a relationship right now?" I asked before walking away. I will never understand why I hang out with any of those boys. Now do I want to go back to the bus or do I maybe want to help out at the merch table?  If I go to the bus, I'm bored and lonely. If I go to the merch table, its screaming fans, Kellin and some friends. Choices.
Merch table it is.
Now I had to figure out how to get there without running into every single fan out there.  I looked around and found Kellin carrying like three boxes of merch. I could just follow him and help him out or something.
"Kellin!" I shouted. He jumped at my voice and ended up dropping two of the three boxes onto the floor.
"Damn it." He muttered.
"Oh sorry." I said and bent down picking up the boxes.
"Its fine."
"Oh well do you need any help?" I asked standing up.
"Sure, just grab a box and follow me."
I nodded and followed Kellin to the merch stand with the boxes in hand.  Thankfully all the fans were too focused on the show to pay attention to Kellin and I walking past them so we got there safe and sound.
"You do realize that when the fans notice you're over here they're going to freak out and possibly completely freak out right?" Kellin said pulling shirts out of the box quickly.
"Yeah I do know that."
"Well then get ready." He muttered and started to set out band shirts quickly.
"I'm always prepared."
Kellin stopped what he was doing and looked at me laughing a little, "Well that's good then. So why'd you want to help at the merch table?"
"I'm bored and the guys are being dipshits."
"How are they being dipshits?" He asked curious.
"They just are." I said and he nodded.
"Oh well how's it going?" He asked making conversation.
"Fine. How about yourself?"
"Tired, my feet hurt." He whined, "Don't get me wrong it's really fun and all but I've had to run back and forth and I keep having to go back to the busses and shit but it's really cool too."
"Well it happens." i said shrugging just as a couple of fans came up.
"You're Vic." One of them said, "Oh my god."
I nodded and smiled, "Yeah I am."
"Can we get a picture with you?"
"Sure." I said and moved from behind the table.  We took the picture quick before they talked a little more before walking off.
"That was nice of you." Kellin said after they left.
"They're fans. I'm always nice to fans."
Kellin nodded smiling a little and for the rest of Of Mice's set that's how it went, me helping Kellin with all of the merch stuff and taking pictures with any of the fans who noticed me at the table when their set ended.
When the set ended fans bombarded the merch table buying everything they had the money for. It was crazy, I give those guys credit for dealing with all those people at once. I mean it was like a mob of people yelling and pushing all at once and Kellin and all the other merch people were running around trying to get it all done as quickly as possible. And Kellin took his job seriously making sure that everyone got what they wanted and made sure that no one ran out of any of the merchandise.
