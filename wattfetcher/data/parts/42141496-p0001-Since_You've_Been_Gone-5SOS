Rowyn's POV:
" And in lane 4, Rowyn Graham!" The man on the loud speaker announces.I can hear my family,friends, and supporters cheer from the stands. As I stand behind the block and feel the familiar sense of jitters form in my stomach.
On the outside, I look as if I've  done this a million times but on the inside....I feel like if i were a chicken that had its head cut off. But how can't I be nervous, I'm about to swim at the Olympic trials. I just can't even right now.
I get on the block and get into the starting position. And that's when the electronic beep goes off and the race begins.
............................
I walk into my house and find my bestest-testest friend, Meredith sitting on my couch watching TV. Were so close that we just walk into each others house. That's not the least bit strange. Like at all.
" Whats up Sassy Comte?" I say as I plop on the couch, feeling like a lethargic kitten,since I just cam back from a jog.
" Nothing much Poo face." she says nonchalantly while never taking her bright blue eyes from the TV. "Listen here Rowyn, You just became an Olympic qualifier, and yet all you do is exercise,sleep and eat. Not that there's anything wrong with eating, food is bae. But anyway the point is we should take a vacation!!!"
" I don't know Mere....."
" Come on!! We can go to Cali for a bit! It'll be so much fun!" She gives me those puppy-eyes with her blond hair framing her face.
" ah screw it! Let's go!"  I run up stairs to pack my bags but as i frolic up the stairs, I hear Meredith let out a loud " Yassssssss!!" I giggle as lug the suitcase out of the closet and shove clothes into my bag....only to be unpacked because I don't like messes.Messes are Ick.
Meredith and I book a flight to LA the next day....at 4AM. I don't know why we booked it so early neither one of us are morning people.
_____________________________________________________
I wake up and look at the alarm clock, instantly regretting booking a flight so early. On the way to  Meredith's house I stop by a gas station to buy soda.I need something to wake me up and I can't get coffee because I hate it with a fiery passion, but if I tell Meredith, she'll go all spider-monkey on me.
I open the door into Meredith's house and creep slowly up the stairs  with my hands scrunched up and at my sides, like a Velociraptor.
" Mere Mere, we go to Cali todayyyyyyyy" I poke her in attempts to wake her up.
" 5 more minutes...." she mumbles as rolls onto her side. That's when I get an idea to wake her up. Because there is one thing in this world that will never cease to motivate her. " Think of all the cute guys on beach....." Within seconds of saying that she shoots up.
" Let's go bish." she gets out and takes maybe 3 minutes.
Once we get to the airport we stop by the McDonalds, i order a big mac, medium fri, 2 hash browns and water. The young teenager looks at me as if i asked him to give me his first born child. It surprises a lot of people on how much I can eat, one of the many perks of being a swimmer. I eat all the food and somehow by me being me i manage to get ketchup in my shoulder length brown hair. After the Ketchup incident I tie my hair into the usual messy bun.
We board the plane and withing seconds of sitting Meredith is asleep, ignoring the flight attendant. But I've run through this speech so many times and shove my earbuds in putting on a play list that includes Green Day, My Chem and Panic! I open up my book and start reading, preparing myself for the 5 hour long flight.

A/N
Hey party People!!!!!! So i would like to thank you for opening up this  little peice of poo. This is based of of an old Movella that i wrote but i looked back on it and saw that it was v v v fetus-ey. ew. So i hope  that this story can turn out to be less fetus-ey.
The story will get longer! I just think that books are kinda awkward to start.
And to anyone who actually read this... 10 brownie points for u.
