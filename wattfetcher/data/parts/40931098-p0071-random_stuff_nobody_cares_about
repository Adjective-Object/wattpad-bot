now that song sorta describes me

sorta

so if you really look at it

I take it as... Crying on the inside. Like the lyrics are the thoughts that run through my head.

Trying to make the best of it, "Just means way more cake for me..."

Feeling sad and disappointed, "I'm laughing, I'm crying... It feels like I'm dying..."

Feeling mocked, "Maybe it's a cruel joke on me.."

do you understand
