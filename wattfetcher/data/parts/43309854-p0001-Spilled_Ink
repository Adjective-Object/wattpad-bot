It was cold

But
I did not feel a thing

For he was next to me
And he kept me warm.


I was scared

But
He held me in his arms

And melted away my fears.


I lost trust in everyone
But

He promised he would never
Do anything to hurt me.


Slowly

I let him in.


Slowly
I began to trust.


Slowly

My fears were gone.


Slowly
I fell in love.


What a mistake.


And now

I am lost again.
