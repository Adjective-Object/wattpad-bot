"I love you." I said.
"I kno -- " he said before kissing me.
Jordan grabbed my hands and pushed them down against the bed, still kissing me.
"I -- " he started before I cut him off.
"I know." I said.
He kept running his fingers through my hair, it's not like I didn't like it he just kept doing it... it was weird.
"What are you doing, doof?" I asked.
"Nothing." He chuckled.
"You're petting me." I said, he laughed and kissed the top of my head before laying down next to me.
"I was not." He said looking straight into my eyes.
"I love you." I said.
"I love you."
We just lied there looking at each other, holding hands for hours...
"I don't know if you're awake but... hey." I said at about two a.m.
"Hmm?" He asked waking up from a deep sleep.
"Were you asleep?" I asked.
"Mmm hmm." He said turning around to see my face.
"I can't sleep, I can't stop thinking about you." I said.
"Just try to shut your eyes." He said after kissing me.
"Good night, Jordan."
"Night, baby. I love ymmm -- " he said as he fell asleep, HE'S SO CUTE!
"I love you too." I said as I drifted off to sleep.
