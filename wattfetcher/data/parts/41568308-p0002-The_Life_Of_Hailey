Hailey's POV

Once we reached Ash's House i was amazed. He lived in a 3 story house and it was white with a dark brown trim. I loved it! i said "I really love you house."Ash said "Thanks but, you will love my mom more." So we walked in and i seen his mom in the kitchen making dinner. "Mom, this is Hailey. Her mom died and her dad ran away so she has no one and she doesn't want to live in a foster home." "Ok, she can live with us we have enough rooms." Ash's Mom said. "Thank you." i said

Ash's POV

I really think Hailey likes my mom. And i kinda have a crush on Hailey. I dont think she likes me but i LOVE her. So i will talk to her abut this tomorrow so she doesn't have a lot of stress on her. I want to confess my love to her but i will do it another day so she can think about it more.
