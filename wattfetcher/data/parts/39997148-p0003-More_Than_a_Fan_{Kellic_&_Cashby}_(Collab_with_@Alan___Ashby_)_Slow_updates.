"I am not cleaning that bunk by myself." I said looking at all of them like they were crazy.
"Well I'm not doing it." Phil scoffed.
"Aaron suggested it." Tino said, "He should do it."
"I agree."
"I still say Aust should do it."
I groaned, "Fine I'll fucking do it."
"Good." Phil said smirking a little as he leaned back in his seat.
I glared at him and got up leaving the lounge and getting to work. I looked at the bunk full of random things that we had just thrown in there and shook my head, this is going to take forever.
Time ticked by slowly as I cleaned the bunk and in that time the bus started moving. I wasn't even halfway done when we came to the first stop and I nearly fell into the abyss of junk.
"What the heck?" I whined trying to steady my balance.
"Austin!" Aaron shouted, "You almost done?"
"No there's still like over half of this junk in here." I called just as I pulled out a ripped thong and let out a yell of disgust throwing it away from me. "Who the hell left a thong in here!"
"What does it look like?" Tino asked walking back to the bunks.
"That." I said pointing to the black thong on the floor.
"Oh I think that was from one of Phil's random booty calls or something."
"Ew." I muttered. Tino just laughed and walked away from me going back to the front.
"Austin! Come meet Alan!"
"But his bunk's not cleaned out yet." I said walking to the front nonetheless.
"Just shut up and come here." Phil said, "This is Alan."
"Don't tell me to shut up." I said once I got to the front and glared at him before looking at our new photographer. I'd be lying if I said he wasn't cute. He had bright orange hair that was a little over his shoulders. He was a little shorter than Phil and he was all around cute.
I smiled at him, "Hi, I'm Austin."
"Alan." He said smiling back at me.
"Nice to meet you."
"You as well."
"Okay well now that you've met our screamer he's going to go back and clean out your bunk for you." Phil said after a few moments of awkward silence.
"Uh yep, that's what I'm gonna do." I said awkwardly backing away nearly knocking over a few thing on the counter, "Oh sorry." I gave them all one last smile before stumbling back to the bunks and finish cleaning out the bunk.
"You looked like an idiot." Aaron said to me. I looked up from the bunk and rolled my eyes before cleaning some more.
"Well sorry, you didn't warn me that our new photographer was that cute." I said and pulled out about five empty bottles.
He rolled his eyes, "Don't think about trying to get with him Aust. This kids all business and school."
"What?"
"Mhm. He sells his stuff to a few different people and he's taking this opportunity to photograph us for his last project for his college class thing."
"Well I never said I was going to. All I said was that he's cute." I said rolling my eyes and standing upright. "I think I'm finished."
