An arm tightened around my torso and I let go of my breath.
Juliet.
I think there's something about Juliet that triggers my memories. Every time she's here, I remember. I don't know what it is, but I think she helps in some way. It could be because we were talking about her before I left the bar and I can't remember anything after that except the end.
I need to remember what happened in between.

Finally an update! And a giant one too, hahaha. This chapter was longer than all the others almost by 1000 words, so I hope you guys enjoyed! And also, yay for Jack's point of view! haha. I don't know if I'll be doing it again soon, but who knows. I change my mind a lot, :))))

Let me know what you guys think and if you would like more chapters in his point of view! :)

PS I'm currently freaking out over the Mockingjay trailer for part 2, honestly chills everywhere and Katniss is my queen.
