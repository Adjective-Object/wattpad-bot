+warned this story maybe triggering at times+-------*------There are different people in school, jocks ,populars,or just plan rejects one girl is the reject of all rejects. Her name is Lily Hope Willson she has long dirty blonde hair , ugly brown eyes that change to an uglier green in the sun , she's only 5'4 the shortie of the school , pale ,and not skinny but not fat. She left Florida with her sister Lexi when she was 12 to Sydney. She likes all kinds of music and isn't really good at singing and playing any instruments but she does it anyway. She gets bullied by five people so she doesn't really have many friends. That girl is me.My bully's are Jenna Hemmings , Luke Hemmings , Calum Hood , Ashton Irwin, and Michael Clifford. Jenna is a blonde ,blue eyed , perfectly tall 5'8 , skinny , tan and has flawless skin. She would probably be the most perfect girl in the world if it wasn't for her shitty attitude. Then Luke , Jenna's twin he's pretty much the same except the fact he's a FUCKING GIANT 6'4 like the fuck and I heard he's really nice but he does anything Jenna what's him to. Then Calum brown hair , brown eyes like mine but hit s aren't as ugly , tan ,also a giant 6'2 maybe also know to be nice but not to me . Ashton has curly dirty blonde hair , pretty hazel eyes and is a giant as well 6'3 ish also known as the nice guy.Then Michael,he dyes his hair a lot but at the moment it's red , he has green eyes and well their all fucking giants he's 6'2ish and pale also nice to others but NOT ME. I think the only reason Calum , Michael and Ashton bully me is because of Luke and Luke because Jenna and Jenna well I have yet to find out why she does it.
