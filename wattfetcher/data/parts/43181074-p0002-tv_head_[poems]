enough
enough

and then
you end up
showing up
to her house
and she
answers
with her
buttermilk skin and
cherry blossom lips
and her
rose nipped cheeks
and most of all
her fucking bones
made of static
and you remember
how beautiful her
wet black hair is
and how she gave
even more shocks
after showers and
you end up crying
for her
and she doesn't understand
because it's all for her
and she thought
nothing was ever for her

and you realize
it's not her buttermilk skin
or her rose-nipped cheeks
or her cherry blossom lips
or her static bones that
make you love static

it's her herself
because she
physically
is static
and you love her
with all your heart

this is for the love and longing of someone you lost, not because some dude is fucking obsessed with static, like nah
