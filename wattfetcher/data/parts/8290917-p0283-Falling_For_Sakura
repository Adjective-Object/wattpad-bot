Now it was a Saturday, two weeks had passed since she moved in with the Suzuki family. To be honest, Sakura was very tired and exhausted today, more so than usual. She blamed that landlord of hers, of course, the mysterious man who had finally decided to let her call him Seb. Just Seb. At first she had thought that he was some middle age billionaire who wanted to hook up with her, but after chatting with him, he had revealed to be something else. She assumed him to be quite young, since he loved to swim and had told her he had won many national championship during his teens, which had only been about ten years ago. So she calculated that he was around twenty-six or twenty-seven. He told her that he loved coffee made by a certain person, his adopted sister, and that she was his world to him. Unfortunately they had a kind of misunderstanding and was currently not on speaking term. Sakura thought that it was so sad and decided to help him out by suggesting to him what he should do. By the time she finished that discussion, it was three in the morning.

- Sakura: I have to go to bed. It's getting late
- Seb: What's the rush? It's going to be a Saturday
-Sakura: LOL! Don't be mean. I have work to do.
- Seb: Oh?
- Sakura: LOL! Don't you oh me, mister
- Seb: Why not?
- Sakura: Coz!
-Seb: Because?
-Sakura: I can't tell you.
-Seb: Why not?
-Sakura: Goodnight, Seb.
-Seb: -
-Sakura: Seb?
-Seb: -
-Sakura: Seb? Goodnight, and I mean it.
-Seb: I want to kiss you

The moment that last sentence came out, Sakura had felt her whole body shook with emotion. Why did Seb wanted to kiss her? They hadn't even met in person yet. And why the name Seb and those words reminded her so much of Sebastian Princeton was beyond her.
Determined to dismiss those words from her mind, Sakura tried to concentrate on Toby and Akira instead.
"Are you sure you're going to be all right looking after Toby for me?" Sakura asked, her eyes on the other woman.
The Japanese beauty waved her hands. "Of course I will be all right." She turned to the dotting pup and said, "Although, I must admit Toby doesn't look very active today."
Sakura turned her attention to the dog in her arms. She gently stroked the canine, wondering what was wrong with him. Once again, she told herself that she had to remember to take him to see the vet. It will have to be another Saturday though, since today was impossible. She had an appointment with Mr. Tachibana for the photoshoot fitting, and by the time she returned, she was sure it'd be too late.
