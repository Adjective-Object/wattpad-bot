After Elina have changed into jeans and a white T-shirt, We ate breakfast then took off.
We walked for 30 minutes, My eyes widened as I scanned the huge building in front of me.
"Don't got malls in jordan" she said sarcastically
"After seeing this, I guess not" Elina chuckled then pulled my hand running to the glass door and broke into the mall
"watch out boys, De chicks have arrived" She said a bit louder than she was supposed to, some people chuckled.
"HEY, SEXY BEAST" A guy shouted, Elina ran to him.
"You didn't bring your boyfriend, did you? please tell me he came by accident" I frowned
"Uh ... " she looked at the grownd biting her bottom lip and holding her boyfriend's hand.
"Ugghhh, I can't believe you" I growled
"Hey, Im Lewis" He extended his hand to shake mine
"I don't shake" I said with a straight face
"someone is grumpy" He teased
"Ikhrass" I said
"what?" both of them stared at me like I was crazy or something.
mind: They don't understand Arabic, Stupid.
me : Oh I forgot.
"I told you to shut up, in Arabic" I grinned, I just realized that I can call anyone with any name and they wont scold me because THEY DON'T UNNDERSTAND ARABIC ! MWAHAHAHHA
"Oh, thank you" He sounded hurt.
uh, well after thinking ... maybe I shouldn't have been rude.
"You better not tease me when I'm in bad mood, sorry"
"It's Okay. So what are we gonna do now?" he hugged Elina
"Woah! There is No 'we', You go home, Me and Elina will go shopping" I said
"Did you notice that you've insulted me TWICE" Elina grasped his hand and he got the message and shut his big mouth up
"Oh really? yeah I did, now go home" I smirked, Elina glared at me
"He's not going home, I invited him to entertain me while you try clothes in the fitting rooms which will take you so long that I might get wrinkles" She explained
me: If looks could kill
mind: Oh yeah girl
"You know what? I don't need you, go with your cheeky cheesy boyfriend and I'll guide myself, bye" I turned my heels
"What's wrong with you, I know I'm hot and can easily make any girl melt, but you don't need to run away because I'm taken" He mocked
"Ha Ha Ha, very funny, believe me, comparing to some handsome Arabian guys, you suck bro" His eyes got filled with anger and frustration.
"Okayyyy, I heard that a new store has opened, It sells maxi skirts, large pants and shirts that may work with your style" she forced a smile to cross her face
"Okay" I turned my heels and walked.
I pulled my phone to see what time it is, but surprise !!! 13 missed calls from ... MOM and 21 from DAD, that must be serious !
I dailled mom's number, she picked up at the third ring.
