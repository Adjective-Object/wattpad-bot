"What's this?" Sakura asked looking at the paper, and turning it.
"It's a job request for you and your friends to go on. It looks easy enough."
"Yeah, it does."
"Also-" Ace started before he stopped to think.
"Well?"
"Nothing your team can handle it."
-----------------------------
In an instant, both Sakura and Aya erupted into flames.

"I will that goddamn son of a bitch later!" Sakura yeeled, her yes glowing to a particularly eerie bloodshot red.

Aya on the hand, had her fist covered with swirling red glitter, "I'll make him feel the pain."
"Wow, I actually feel sorry for Ace."

---

"So that means you're leaving?" Millie whined.
"Yeah, and unfortunately, we have to drag Haruka with us." Sakura answered, her hand firmly holding onto the Haruka's limp arm.
"No, the most unfortunate thing is that I have to on a train!" Aya cried.
"Why does she hate trains?"
"Motion Sickness."
"I see."
"Anyways, I'm not worried for you, you have Sayo and Gemi to protect right?"
"Asshole, such a things doesn't make me happy!" Sayo sang, blushing.
"You look pretty happy to me." Gemi answered.

"Well, By Millie-chan!"
"Bye!"
"Bye Bye! I hope to see you again, Asuka-chan!" twilight shouted. Sakura stopped for a second and waved back answering, "Yeah!"

Finally, done! *closes laptop then walks away*
Ace: Excuse me for a minute whilst I bring back the Author-chan.

*Ace leaves*

Law: *facepalms and sighs* Why the hell am I back here?
Zoro: Because the readers like you.

Mihawk: Also Haruka requested that you be there.
Zoro: M-Mihawk!

Mihawk: Nice to see you again, Roronoa.
Haruka: Wait, where is Sakura?

Mihawk: What do you mean?
Law: It means, that this is not part of the actual conversation, that we're 'supposed' to be having. At least, not until Fire Fist-ya comes back.
