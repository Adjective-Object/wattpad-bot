Natasha POV I woke up looking around where am I?....I sniffed the air. Aww man. I hate hospitals. I sat up and just as I did my baby walked in " BABY" we both yelled she ran jumping on me kissing all over my face. I smiled and giggled "baby I think you should phone the-" I turned my head to the trash can throwing up . Ruby jumped up rubbing my back and holding my hair . This is SO embarrassing. I don't want her seeing me like this at all. I feel ugly. I finally stopped puking " I covered my mouth and looked up at her." Sorry." She stared at me before running out. I furrowed my eyebrows and got up walking to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Wow I really did get ugly. Maybe that's why she ran out.
Ruby POV
I couldn't take it. I had to leave. She doesn't know she's pregnant. I really don't know how to explain all this to her either. She's better off with out me....
THE END
**********************SIKE I wouldn't do y'all like that....or would I?
