Also read my friends book. It called Raven. I think her username is grungelifestyle or something. I DONT KNOW!!!! But the cover is a girl with a black thing over her face. Anyways!! Back to the story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-Lisa's POV-
I was sittimg on my bed watching tv. Just relaxing. I was still confused on why Niall moaned, and why he was blushing when he saw me after I woke him up. Maybe I should go ask him? Naw, I wanna be alone. The boys seemed nice. But then again, my other parents seemed nice too, then they started beating me a month after I turned 10.
-flashback-
"We don't love you!"
WHIP!
"Your ugly!"
Whip!
"Your a slut!"
Whip!
It kept coming. The whips from a belt, and the insults. I didn't understand why. I didn't do anything.
-reality-
Tears came running down my face and I wiped them away furiously.  I'm hungry. I finally got the strength to get up and go downstairs. I ran down the steps and saw the boys watching a movie.
"Hey Lisa, you wanna watch a movie with us?"
"No I'm fine thanks. Just came downstairs to get something to eat."
"You sure?"
"Positive."
I walked into the kitchen before they could ask me if I was absolutely sure. I opened the fridge looking for something. Anything. I finally decided to get myself some cookie dough icecream. Thats when I notice the bags by the door. I stared at them. Eh, I'll get them tommorow morning. I went upstairs eating my ice cream on the way and put on frozen. I loved this movie. Elsa's my favorite. I just loved her voice. I didn't know if I could or couldn't sing considering I'm mute. I stared at the tv and fell asleep after finishing the movie.
-The next morning-
I woke up. The stupid alarm clock woke me up. I Looked at the time and immediately threw my head back on the pillow. I loved my bed. My bed loved me. We have an beautiful relationship, but my alarm clock won't let us be together. That jealous bastard. I groaned getting out of bed and dragging my feet to my bathroom door. I brushed my teeth, and went to the kitchen. I was to tired to take a shower. I decided to make breakfast for the boys considering they we're sleeping and I loved cooking. It took me awhile before I decided on making Bacon with eggs. 30 minutes after I made them, the boys finally woke up.
"Whats that amazing smell?"
"Its Bacon *sniff sniff* eggs. Yeah. Bacon and eggs."
"How do you know this?!?!"
"Its a talent."
The boys walked downstairs and sat down and started eating.
"Wow, Lisa did you make this?"
I nodded.
"Wow it amazing. I didn't know Bacon and eggs could taste so good."
I smiled. I already ate. We just sat and watched movies and played board games all day. Thats it, then we fell asleep on the livingroom couch.
