Maybe I would jump off a bridge.
What a cliche way to go out.
I needed to go out without notice.
Yet still with a bang.
Was I really planning my death?
I slumped my head back and looked toward the clouds.
Why was it that the clouds got to drift aimlessly?
Why was it that the had no problems?
Why was it they weren't human?
If they were human either their lives would go beautifully
Or they would suffer a living hell.
No in between.
One or another.
I kept walking.
I wished I could walk off the edge of the world.
Damn you Columbus for proving that theory wrong.
Theories.
Theories.
Like the theory we could be invincible.
Complete lie.
We are naked against the host of hell.
The demons that invade our lives everyday damn day.
