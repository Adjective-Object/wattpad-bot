The Abused.Janelle Life Series. Tears and Fears.
................................."Welcome to your new home"  she said shaking me in her tender arms.
I was just three months old.Seeing this new strange house made me cry.I was used to a cream coloured house with the entrance covered completely with roses.This one was brown with dying green leaves at the front.
She shook me before she placed me in the basket and dropped me at the front door.
A woman walked out the door with a black dress with green highlights.She grabbed the basket violently.And gave me a grin.
She touched my lips then my nose then traced it to my eye brows.
I began to cry.The woman I always knew always wore colourful, cheerful and bright clothes.
She took me into the house and placed me on the table.
They maltreated me until Now.▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪
"How many times have I told you never to touch my skimmed milk" she said then she slapped me.
"I'm sorry"
"Get out and I don't want to ever see you in that kitchen ever again unless I send you"
"How will I eat"
"I don't care you can die for all I care" she said laughing before she sat down on the sofa and asked for a cup of coffee.
"Okay"
"Why do they hate me" I cried as I attempted to open the coffee container and ended up spilling the coffee on the floor.
"What have you done you bastard" she grabbed me by the hair and threatened to kill me with a knife.
"Please"
She dropped the knife and left the kitchen.
