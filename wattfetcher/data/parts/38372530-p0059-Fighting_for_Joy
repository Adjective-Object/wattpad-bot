"What did you just call me!" I asked yelling
"Lauren baby please." He said touching his temples.
"I hate you!" I yelled and got out the car fast.
I began to walk with blurred eyes down the street with six inch wedges on my feet.
I could see his car turn around in the direction of me and he began to follow me.
"Baby get in the car!" He yelled.
I shook my head and continued my walk.
