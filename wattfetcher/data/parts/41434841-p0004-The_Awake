Idk. This is all still really weird to me. But yeah. I found a song. I think it's something that'll help even if it is about suicide. It's called Don't Wanna Go by The Lumineers. Idk I'll throw the video up there. But I figured I might as well write what it means to me/what I think when I hear it. I won't type out the whole song. Just parts that stick out to me.
"Just wake up, I shoutedThere's some blood, around the-Clean it up, it's okayGo get help, it's okay"
His brother won't wake up. He's overdosed on pills and harmed himself as far as I know. He's telling himself it's okay even though he knows it's not as he wipes the blood off of his hands and runs to find a phone to call the police.
"Suits were made for men, not boys"
His brother was young. Still a boy. His first suit shouldn't have been at his funeral.
"And this faith that we fake is a choice"
He's questioning his faith because God "let" his brother die. He claims the faith he chose is fake.
"I don't wanna goIf it means goodbyeAnd I don't wanna seeI don't wanna be thereIf it's the last time"
He doesn't want to go and see his brother if it means he's dying and it's the last time he'll see him. He doesn't want to be there to see him dead.
"In a sudden panicLike a drugless addict"
Its finally set in that his brother is dead and he panics. He's used to always having his brother there and now that he's gone he's lost. Kind of like an addict without their drugs.
Idk. I think that's it. I might not be right but that's what I think. Just yeah. I feel a connection to this song.
I guess that's it.
