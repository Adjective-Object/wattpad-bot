“Uhm…” You can really tell how hesitant Art was about it. However, instead of showing me the picture, he grabbed my hand and directed me to follow him. I wasn’t expecting that move to come from him. It was very sudden.
“Wait! Wait! Art, what are you doing?”
“Shh! Pearl might hear us. You do realize that Pearl has the ear of the wolf right? She can hear things as if she’s standing close to you.” He whispered. Okay, the whispering is a little bit awkward? I’m confused. Isn’t he gonna’ report this to her anyway?

“…”
==========================================================
Art led me to the school’s Music Room. There was no one there since everyone from the Music Club is currently doing a fund-raiser for the upcoming Music Fest. I don’t know why but this is slowly becoming weird. The quiet environment makes it even weirder. I decided to break the silence by asking him what we were doing there. “Art, why are we here?”
“You told me you want to see the picture. Well, I’m gonna’ show it to you here.”
“So… you really took a picture of us? You know? Almost…” I simply cannot mention the word, ‘kissing’ as it’s too embarrassing to say.
“Kissing?” There he said it for me. I nodded in response. “Yes. It was an accident though… nevermind, I think it’s fated to happen.”
“What do you mean?” This is really getting awkward. I mean, why is everyone mentioning Fate or Destiny? What the fuck?
“Well, I was about to grab this book about Photography and… well, the book is to be found on the farthest part of the Library – you know, the Arts section? Where you two are sitting…”
“And?”
“I saw you about to… kiss.”
“Well, you certainly misunderstood everything!”
“So… I took a picture of the scene and yeah, too bad the capture sound was very audible.”
“…”
“I kinda’ ruined the moment for you two. Sorry.”
“W-what m-moment?!” I started stuttering again. Memories about the scene Art was talking about flooded my head. The way he lifted my chin softly with his gentle hand, the way he tilted my head so that we’re face to face, and the way he leaned closer... Oh god. “Nooooooooo!”
“You know Chase? You’re really funny! Haha.” Art chuckled at the sudden shout I just let out.
“W-what?” My face started feeling hot again. Oh no. Why am I blushing?
“Yes, you really are, haha! Here you go. Scroll down to the very bottom and you will see the picture.” He gave me this smile so reassuring that you can feel how genuine and sincere it was. I took the camera and browsed the folders for the picture in question. I accidentally opened one of the albums and was surprised with what I saw. They were all pictures of me!
“What the fuck?! Why are there pictures of me here?” I’m super-confused right now.
“O-oh.” He struggled looking for the right words. After a full thirty-second thinking, he confidently answered me. “I remembered Pearl borrowing my camera. That’s probably why.”
“Oh… That Psycho! She’s even taking pictures of me! Is she a stalker? Look at this. I look so bad when I’m eating!”
