LOOKING FOR CHARACTERS ART: If you've made materials such as characters posters and video for Falling For Sakura and you would like me to post it for people to see, I would love to hear from you. Just contact me and attach a copy on my Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/AuthorAlexiaPraks). Also, I am looking for some digital art for a new Falling For Sakura Book Trailer. If you are an artist, then please please I would love to hear from you. For ideas, just watch my book trailer above. Your name will be acknowledged on the trailer as well as posters etc on here as well pinterest, Facebook, and my website and blogs ^_^
