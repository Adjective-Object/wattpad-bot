Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
Everyone looks surprised, and starts clapping. I laugh as the rest of the room starts cheering and whistling. Everyone gets up, and comments on my performance. I laugh accepting them bashfully.
I turn to Mr. Shue with a serious look on my face, the room fell silent. Mr. Shue looked at me with a serious face, but his face broke out into a smile.
"WELCOME TO THE NEW DIRECTIONS!' Everyone cheers and I laugh as I'm enveloped into a big group hug.
Later that day, I am bringing my dad food since he'll be at work all day. I get out of the car with our food, and walk through the doors of Dalton Academy. "Miss, what are you doing here?" I hear a lady ask. I turn to my right to see a secretary looking at me sternly.
"I'm Mr. Hardacre's daughter, my dad said I can bring some food to him." I flash the secretary my innocent smile, and she looks at me once again before nodding her head. There were a few boys walking around the halls, and when they saw me they would look me up and down or whistle. I held my head high, though and ignored them. These boys are acting as if they never seen a girl before.
The sound of voices and music became louder as I made my way down the hall to my dad's room.

I finally find out the music and voices are coming from a library looking room, with a bunch of boys dancing and singing. I find Blaine in there as well and I smile as they look like they are having so much fun. A boy with the black hair and brown eyes was singing lead.
