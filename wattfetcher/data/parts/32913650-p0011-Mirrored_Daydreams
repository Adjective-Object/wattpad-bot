"Okay, I'll text you what I end up going with," She said smiling back. I nodded then she walked back to her dorm and I walked back into mine. "Sorry about that," I told Gavin.

See you tonight," and gave me a quick hug and smile. "Bye." I said, shutting the dorm door behind him. He gave me a hug! I texted the girls on the group chat and they all started saying, "Get it!!" With winky faces and kissy faces. I laughed and told myself I better start getting ready since it was now 4:12....
