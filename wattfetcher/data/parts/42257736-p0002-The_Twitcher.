I changed out of my tight blue uniform and placed it in my new handbag.
It's Gucci.
I walked out into the parking lot and saw Sam leaning on my car.
I sent him a questioning look and he just smirked.
"Well this is a pleasant surprise" I giggled.
"Well you know me. Full of surprises!" He laughed.
"Sorry about the game." I apologized.
"No it's okay. I was the one being a d*ck" he said.
He then proceeded to hug me.
It was nice.
"I kind of wish this was real" I said into his jacket.
"So do I" he sighed.
We hugged for a while until I received a text.
It was from my Mum.
"I have to go, Lilia is acting up again." I said as I rushed into the car.
Lilia is my little sister.
She has sleep issues that cause her to act out sometimes.
I pushed on the pedal with so much force and sped off.
I arrived home within 2 minutes and rushed inside.
"Lilia! Get to bed now!" My Mum screamed.
I walked into the living room and it was practically torn apart.
Pillows were everywhere and the couch was flipped on its side.
Lilia had Mums most expensive vase in her hand and was about to drop it before I screamed.
"LILIA! BED. NOW. MUM! BEDROOM. NOW!" I yelled.
They scattered like rats and I was left alone with a giant mess to clean up.
I lifted the couch and placed all the pillows back on it.
I picked up all the family photos and placed them back on the brick mantle.
Our living room is small.
It's litterally just enough for the four of us.
After I swept up all the glass I walked into Lilia's room and sat down on her bed.
"Troyian why did you yell?" She asked softly from her position in the corner of the room.
"I'm sorry I didn't mean to. Mum was just stressed and that makes me stressed" I answered
"I'm sorry for being naughty" she said as she crawled into her tiny pink bed.
She was soon asleep so I left her and walked over to my Mum's room.
She sat on her bed crying.
"Mum?" I asked
She looked up at me and patted the seat beside her.
I walked over to her and hugged her.
"I know it's hard. It will get better. He might come back" I said softly
"He isn't coming back. I know it. If he hadn't left Lilia would be normal." She cried.
"I know that Mum. We just have to stay strong. For Lilia." I said as the tears began to fall.
"God Troyian when did you get so mature?" She laughed.
