I was reading like always under ny oak tree till everything changed. There were alarms and sirens, Typhoon sirens. A couple hours later I went back outside to retrieve what was left of some stuff but everything was still perfect except a girl stuck in the tree. I ran to her and got her out. She flinched when I touched her and when I held her closer she woke up. I looked at her pale blonde hair with blue streaks and hwr pale skin with light freckles. Her small but agile body was perfect for swimming. She was perfect. She woke up and got scared." Who are u" her silky sweet voice said." Im Inferno and u" I asked putting her down." Hurricane" she said and feathered her side bangs." Well Hurricane why are u here" I asked trying not to be as weird as I knew I was." I dont really know. I ho where the tide wants me to go I guess" she said fixing her hair." Hey Inferno im coming over the fence" my best friend volcano said. Hurricane was a girl and girls were very rare. Volcano was a fanboy for girls..... oh no. Before I could tell Hurricane to hide he was over the fence. Hurricane's eyes filled with fear as he ran up to her." Its a girl" he yelled and tried to hug her but she pulled away." Go with what im about to do" I mouthed to her." Volcano she is flattened but she is mine" I said and pulled her to me which I really didn't mind." Yah right dude" he said." Volcano I am flattered but im afraid my heart belongs to Inferno" she said politely." Ull be back so Inferno r u looking forward to the party" he said." Sure we'll go with that but dont u have to go get ready" I said and he left." Hes ...... scary" she said." Dont say that to him or he'll try even harder" I said and took her inside.
