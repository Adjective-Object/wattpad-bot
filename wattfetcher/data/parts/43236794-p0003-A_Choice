Sunny smiled Â as he squatted down to my eye level and said" So Lass what's your name? we have to call you something."
I looked at him and said" My name is Kathrine Jones Mr. Sunny. and this here is Bandit." I looked down at Bandit with his tongue sticking out.
Sunny Smiled and said" Well it's nice to meet you Kathrine and Bandit. And please don't call me Minter it's just Sunny, your part of the family now." then Sunny stood up and sighed.
"We better get these horses taken care of before it gets to late, Have you ever unsaddled a horse?" Sunny asked looking down at me.
I then put Bandit down and said" I've helped my Pa before with our horses."
Sunny gave a sad smile and said" well, come on then better get started."
After an hour of taking care of the horses, Sunny and I were finally done.  I looked around the barn to see all the horses happy in there stalls. I then looked up at Sunny and said" they are all in their stalls."
Sunny looked down at me and said" yup, thanks a lot with taking care of them,  we better get inside and eat."
I nodded and whistled and Bandit came running to my side as we walked to the cabin. Once we got into the cabin it was pretty small, there was one big room and then two bedrooms off to the side. As Sunny and I walked to the table there was just enough food left for both of us. We sat in the dimly lit room as we heard Sunny's brothers snoring away in sleep, We ate in silence.
After We ate Sunny washed are dishes, then he found a pillow and some blankets and he put them on the floor next to the fire place saying" you can sleep here for tonight. I will find a better sleeping arrangements for tomorrow night, But go to sleep now."
I laid down and pulled the blankets over me and whispered" thank you." then Bandit curled up next to me. Sunny patted me on the head and whispered" good night" then he went off to bed.
