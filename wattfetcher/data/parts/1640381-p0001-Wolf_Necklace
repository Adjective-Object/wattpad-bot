“NOOOOOO, Daddy, please stop, I promise it won’t happen again, PLEAS JUST STOP!”  I begged. But it was too late; he’d already gotten my shirt off and was working on my pants. “Please Sto...” I started again, but quickly shut up when I felt a blade press against my neck “no, I won’t stop this is your punishment for burning dinner tonight” he whispered in my ear, and then proceeded to rape me.

my name is Alison Kamper, and I’m 16. My mother died when I was 5 leaving me only silver wolf with jade eyes on a lether cord instructing me to never take it off, and since then I been constantly beaten and blamed for her death. after her death I wasn’t allowed to leave the house for 8 years, once I turned 13 I was once again let out of the house but only for the 30 second walk it took to get to the car and be driven to his nightclub where he ties me up and lets his buddies do whatever they want with me. Why don’t I run away? You ask, because I’m terrified of what he’ll do if he ever caught me.
“ALISON MARI KAMPER”, I flinched when he used my full name, it usually meant that I was going to be punished big
time.  “Get you self down here and explain why my dinner is not done!”
I got out of bed and walked down stairs to face him “Well” he said with a
smirk on his face “you’d better have a good reason”
“I...I..I.....Well....you......you...
s...see”
“well spit it out girl. I don’t
have all night.”
“I.....I...I fell asleep” I
whispered
“what did you say? I couldn’t hear you”
“I fell asleep....” he just stop there staring at me “I’m sorry daddy, I didn’t mean to please don’t punish me” I sobbed
“YOU LITTLE BITCH, who....said......you.....could......fall.....asleep?” he punctuated each word with a stab to my chest “for that you will sleep outside tonight” he said with a kick to my ribs, and I was sure I heard a crack. “And don’t even think about running away
if you do, I will find you and make you wish you were dead. Now GET OUT OF MY
SIGHT” I heard another crack as he kicked me out the open door.  closing
my eyes I tried to ignore the pain.

Jakes POV
It felt good to walk, i was finally able to escape after listening to 6 straight years about how i had to find a mate before i could become alpha. most wolves found their mate by the age of 13. I was now 16 and my family was anxious for me to find a mate, my mother said i was just a late bloomer but i had a feeling it was more than that, i thought it was that i was destined to have a human as a mate, not that my family believed me, alphas were not supposed to be mates with a human, in the past 100 years no alpha had ever had a human mate. it was why i had snuck out. i had too get away from my father and his ranting about me finding a mate, that and my sister and her mate, who happen to be my best friend had been going at it all night.
