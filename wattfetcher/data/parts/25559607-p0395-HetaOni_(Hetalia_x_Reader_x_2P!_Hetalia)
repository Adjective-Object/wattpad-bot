What was that about?



Luciano felt really off back there. He always seemed to be a tough, stoic kind of guy when I first met him. Was I wrong? Or...maybe it's actually another side of him. Well, if it was, that side is completely different from what he really shows off to us.




I raised my hand to my head, where he pat me earlier. "...It's a...good different, though."



I felt blood rush to my cheeks as thoughts ran through my mind. Realising this, I shook my head. "Dammit, (Second Name). You can't marry a man you just met—wait, what?! Who was thinking of marrying anyone?! Ugh! Stop thinking about it! I'm being silly again. I'm talking to myself, too. Damn, am I that lonely?! And—"


Tick.


Tock.


Tick.


Tock.


I suddenly looked around the room. "Wh-What? I thought Luciano already took the clocks with him?"



Just as I did before, I tried to find where the source of the ticking was. My eyes gazed down to the floor. I knelt down and spoke, "...my bag?" With a determined look, I reached to unzip my bag. That is, until...



***RIIIINGGG****


A loud ringing sound suddenly echoed through the room.



"What the heck is it this time?!" I hissed. My heart started to pound from the unwanted surprise. What is this, some sort of suspense story? I wanted to rant, but then I realised that the sound came from my pocket.



I reached inside my pocket and pulled out a phone. It was still ringing. I was intrigued once more. "Who'd be calling me at a time like this?" I wondered. I looked at the screen, it was an unregistered number.
