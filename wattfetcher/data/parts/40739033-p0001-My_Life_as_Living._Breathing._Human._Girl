My day was okay. Well not okay. Not even close to okay or sorta okay. I had a major...unsatisfying..embarrassing day at the park today with my brother and me gran. So at around lunch time I went to the park and brought me penny board and purse. I was not dressed to impress because I thought I wouldn't see anyone I new..because it is memorial day and everyone would be or should be out. I wore a gray top with a elephant sketch on it, black soccer shorts, and black flats with me hair pinned back in a ponytail. I rode around and then after 10 minutes I sat myself on the swing. Then guess who came strolling with his two brothers? My crush. Whoopee. Not only I was dressed like I just crawled outta bed, me gran was buying me a hello kitty Popsicle from the ice cream man as my brother was sucking messily on his. My crush...let's call him Dave...came over to the swings. Then me gran gave me my Popsicle and then whispered rather loudly. "Hey Sweetie isn't that the boy you told me you like?!? He's rather a hevan then the dreamy sucker you explained to me!" Then she snorted loudly. I blushed and literally grabbed ice cream smashed it in my face. Because I was thinking, Maybe if I bury my face in a Popsicle he want know who it is! But no. His friends laughed away...not him...as I ran to me grans car like a dumbfounded idiot. So. Yah. Wasn't my day just absolutely perfect?
