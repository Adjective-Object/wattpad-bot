" Justin calm down " I said softly putting a hand on his shoulder then I felt him loosen up a bit
"I'm sorry kylie I didn't mean to scare you like that if I did I'm really " Justin said with his head down then I cut him off
" Justin I'm not scared" I said rubbing my hand across his cheek which made him look at me
" kylie Braun I think you might just be the death of me" he said shaking his head smiling
"How so" I asked
" Ill go to any length to protect you even if it means I have to give up my life in return for yours" he said smiling slightly
"Iloveyou with no spaces but I wanna go swimming" I whined
" OK baby " he said picking me up bridal style
" where did Ryan and chaz go" I asked as he set me by the pool and then he sat down on the edge
" they took alex home " he said clenching his fist then unclenching them
" Justin calm down. OK he's gone and I'm safe " I assured him scooting over to him
" i know its just I don't want anyone to hurt you. " he said lowering his Head then I caressed his face in the hands
" Justin no one will hurt me as long as I have you " I said
