It was a beautiful laugh, and Sosuke found himself smiling at her with delight.
"Er," he began, wanting to know what her name was.
"Dear, here I was mumbling on about nonsense to you. Sorry about before but I have to run," she said and rushed off in the opposite direction toward the other side of the hotel.
Sosuke watched her pacing off, her heels clicking on the marble floor, her long hair swaying about her back as she rushed.
Akira said as she watched Sosuke walking into the lift, "Look at him go, flirty with some blond while he tell me off to stay put." She turned to Tristan then. "Do you think that's fair?"
Tristan chuckled. "Nope. Not at all."
"That blond looked familiar though," Conrad said, cocking his head to one side. Even though she had her back to them and the fact that she was a good distance away, he had the nagging feeling that he had seen her somewhere before. But for the life of him, he couldn't figure out when and where.
"Well, I supposed I shan't need looking after," Akira said then. "And I might have to hurry before Tachibana-sama get upset with me being late for his show." She turned to her aunty and gave her a tight hug. "I will see you after the show, Oba-chan."
"Do your best, Akira-chan," Haruka said softly.
"Yes," Akira replied. Then she turned to the brothers. "Nice to meet you all." She bowed at them in which the brothers nodded back. Then she elegantly sailed away.
"That's a model walk," Tristan said to himself. He turned to Haruka then. "Is modeling for Mr. Tachibana?"
"Yes," Haruka replied.
