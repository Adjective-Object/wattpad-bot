"Mom?" You asked, frightened.Your mom was laughing like crazy and was walking towards you with something behind her back.Suddenly, her face began to change into the face of a killer and said, smiling, "I never loved you."She then pulled a knife from her back and sliced you. Then everything went black.

You woke up with a jolt, sweating like crazy. You looked over at your alarm clock. 3:26. You still have three hours until you have to get up to go to school. You sighed and looked up at the ceiling then your (f/c) walls.
You felt a kind of presence of someone in the room. You ignored it and began thinking about your dream.
Why do I always have that dream?Â  You asked yourself, looking at your comforter. You have no idea. Your parents have been fighting for a few years about mom's drinking, so is that it? Maybe. Shrugging the thought away, you turned on your side and fell asleep with that strange feeling of someone watching you drifting off with you.
