You smile back. Hes climing the vines on the side on the house. Once he gets up to were you are he kisses you. You kiss back. But pull back and poke his cheek. He looks sad that you pulled back but confused. "Why are you here?" You ask. "I want my cuddle buddy back." He says in a litte kids voice.  You laugh and say. "Ok fair enough I guess." He smiles and says "My sexy karate girl cuddle buddy." You roll you eyes and laugh again then poke his nose and peck his lips. You and him climb back into the Window. Miltons dad says out side your room "Hey y/n you ok." You panic but say "yeah im ok." "K just checking." "K" you look at Jack and see what hes wearing. He's wearing bright Orange fluffy pants with a lime green tank top and bright......pink? Socks. You laugh causing him to look confused. You point to his out fit and he laughs to. After theres no more laughing. Theres silence. As he stares into your eyes he leans in and kisses you as you kiss back. When you pull away you smile at him. You and Jack get in bed and cuddle then fall asleep.
