During the time (Older) Finland and Russia were together, Ivan would always introduce Roosa as Roosa Braginski to everyone, because he couldn't stand the fact she kept Berwald's surname. Roosa usually didn't say anything to it, not wanting any problems with the Russian. Whenever she introduced herself by her real name, Roosa Oxenstierna, Ivan would shout at her later.
The arguments about the topic would end with him saying something insulting that he really didn't even mean. It wasn't that rare for Roosa to have him shouting that he didn't want to be seen with Berwald's former whore and things like that.
Actually Ivan was always just afraid that she still loved the Swede and would go back to him. In the end, Finland got her independence, because he went too far with trying to keep her all to himself. He started the Russification, because he couldn't stand how much Finland was like Sweden. He wanted to turn her as Russian as possible, so she would never have a reason to leave.
I suppose he never really understood that if he had succeeded with his plan, Roosa wouldn't had been the person he fell in love with in the first place.
