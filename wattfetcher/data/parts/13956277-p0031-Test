"DON'T CHOKE IT" And he let it go...
"now we need to chase it, idiot" Elina slapped his arm.
The game has begun.
Angry birds. Level : impossible.
.......
"I think you have to give up, we can;t find it" Damon breathed heavily and Elina agreed.
"come on ! we've been chasing it only for 15 minutes and you're already tired" I sighed "Come on get up, we're not gonna sleep before I find my chicken"
"DAMON, LEENA, ELINAAAAA" Mrs.Carter shouted from upstairs and we all ran up.
"can someone please explain to me, WHY IS THERE A FREAKING CHICKEN IN MY BATHTUB HAVING A BUBBLE BATH" She shouted angrily and we all bursted out laughing .
"Sorry, In 10 minutes it will no longer be flapping around" I took it and went to the garden.
"What are you going to do" Elina asked.
"We are gonna eat it on the Islamic halal way, give me a sharp metal knife" I caught it and pointed the chicken's head toward the 'Qibla', "Bismellah" in a swift movement I cut the chicken's pharynx and half of her neck. it's a 'she' right ? the chicken is a female.
Elina screamed loudly and ran to the house.
"Nice, now you're officially a killer" Damon sighed
"Please don't force me into being a human killer, because believe me, I'm trying my best to hold myself"
"Now what" he asked
"Now we wait until it lets the blood out ... most of it. I guess that's how it's done, I've seen my father do that to a sheep, so maybe it's the same way with chickens"
"interesting" he sighed.
"Now, who's gonna take off its feathers?" I asked and Damon ran into the house.
"Me" I sighed

And what a chicken, enjoying a bathtub. But it's her last day! who are we to judge her then !
