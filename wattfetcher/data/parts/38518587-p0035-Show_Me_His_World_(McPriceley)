Kevin didn't know what to do.
He couldn't be alone, not tonight. When he scrolled through his contact list with his eyes freshly opened by Lauren, he saw a list of fake friends and angry women. One name caught Kevin's attention and he dialed it reluctantly.
The phone almost rang out completely until Kevin got an answer on the last ring. "Hello Kevin."
"Hey, can you come over?"
Without hesitation, without asking why, or needing any explanation, they responded: "Yes."
"Thanks Connor."
