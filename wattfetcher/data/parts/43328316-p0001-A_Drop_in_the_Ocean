"Kat," my mom yelled across the house. "Come down here right now!"
"Ugh," I whispered to myself. "I'm coming!" I yelled back. I sprinted down the stairs. I was a little nervous. I'm not sure what Mom wants, but it can't be good.
"Katherine! Please explain this!" Mom screeched. She was pointing to my report card. "Four C's and three D's! This is unacceptable! You can do much better than this Kathrine! I accept at least two B's and absolutely no D's!"
"Mom! C's are average! They are good! I got three D's because SOMEONE won't help me study!" I yelled back.
"That's it Katherine! Go to your room! You're grounded for three weeks!" She screamed pointing down the hall.
"Really? ONLY three weeks?" My little brother Caleb said walking into the kitchen.
I reached out and slapped his arm. "Really Caleb?" I yelled.
"Katherine! Do not hit your brother! Go to your room now!" Mom yelled getting ever more mad.
I backed out of the room. I walked back to my room. Little does Mom know but I love my room. She doesn't take away my electronics. Mom also let's me go places, just not with my friends.
I texted my best friend, Mallory. I told her about me being grounded. All she did was laugh.
I called Mom and asked her if j could go to the park. She said yes. I grabbed my book, notebook, and colored pencils. I left the house and started walking towards the park.
Once I reached the park, I found and cozy bench and started drawing. I was working on my self portrait. I'm ugly. I have brownish-reddish wavy hair. I have pale skin, freckles, and quite a bit of acne. I also have really ugly green eyes. I have silver braces. No boy has ever liked me. I'm not a loser but I'm not popular. I have quite a bit of friends and wish I had a boy friend.
I heard someone walking over to me. The person sat down next to me.
"Wow! You're really good at drawing!" A deep voice said leaning into me to get a better look. "Who are you drawing?" The boy asked.
