"She is here I smelt her" the husky voice growled.
I took off a headphone and and listened.
"How can you be so sure, there were lots of females and they tend to wear perfume" another voice said.
I walked away from the voices.
"Hey, what are you doing out of class" a voice yelled.
I looked at the voice. I rolled my eyes at Howey. He got the hall monitor because he passed all his classes. He thinks he is top dog. All he does is yell at people to hurry to class. Nobody messes with him because he is a Alphas son. Not next in line but he was the next in line brother.
I ignored him and I felt a hand on my shoulder.
I growled and roughly turned around and took off my head phones.
"Don't touch me" I growled.
He gave me a un frightened look. He through he was all tough.
"Get to class Becca or your going to detention." he said.
I gave one last growl when he hit a button.
"I would tell your mommy and daddy but seems they aren't here" he laughed.
Howey wasn't big built like his brother. Sure he worked out but really anybody could take him.
I turned on foot to face him. My fist white. I gave him one good punch in the face. He stumbled back. My anger clouded my thoughts.
"Don't ever talk about my parents again Howey or I swear I will do much worse then punch your ugly ass face" I snarled.
I said Howey like it was a evil entity.
"Hey, what's going on here" the husky voice called.
I turned to face him. The world stopped. I almost got lost in his brown eyes. He was reaching out to touch me.
"Don't touch me" I snarled at him.
He gave a small whimper.
It hit me. He was my mate. I did what was best.
"I Becca Steel reject Alec Winter as my mate" I said and turned on one foot and walked out of the school.
Why does it feel like my heart was ripped apart.
