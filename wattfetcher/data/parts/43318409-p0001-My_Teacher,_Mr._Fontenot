Summer break is over and time for school again. Yn gets up and starts getting ready for school. After she did her hygiene & placing her clothes on. Then left for school.
Yn arrived to school, and walked through the doors of her normal boring school.
She walked to her locker to be greeted by her friend Tess.
Tess : Hey Yn! Yn: hey! Tess: guess what there's going to be a new teacher this school year for reading. His name is Mr. Fontenot . And he's fine as hell like no joke.💯
Yn: Oh true *Smirks* ooo I want to see! But i don't know if I have him though.
Tess: check your schedule .
Yn: * pulls out schedule, then scans through it* Yes! I have him for reading😏.
Tess: Me too! Come on let's start heading to class.
The girls head to mr fontenot's class. They found his class and walked in. Yn scanning the classroom but didn't see no teacher.
Tess: where is he? He needs to hurry his ass up!
Unknown: okay class everyone take your seats!
The class scatters around looking for a seat. Yn and Tess sat next to each other of course.
Unknown: Good morning students. I'm your new reading teacher. I'm Mr. Fontenot. I'm going to be teaching this class for the school year.
All the girls: Dayyyyummm he fine!
Mr. Fontenot: um, excuse me?
Tess raises her hand
Mr.fontenot: Yes?
Tess: sorry mr. Fontenot it's just that you're very attractive. 😏
Mr. Fontenot: oh well I'm flattered, thank you. Let's make sure this won't happen again, because ladies I'm just your teacher nothing more okay? *he says assertive*
Class: okay.
Mr. Fontenot: okay then. *He walks behind his desk* well let's be honest, even though I'm a teacher. I really don't like doing anything I'm just the type of person to sit around and not to do anything. So since it's the first day how about we not do any work. Is everyone okay with that? *He asks looking around*
Class: Yes!
Yn POV
Mr. Fontenot suddenly takes his phone out, then starts playing the weeknd, partynextdoor, fetty wap, etc. then with some of the songs he started doing crazy ass dance moves😂. (Dances he does on younow) he even hit the whip. 😂😂 then he even let the whole class start dancing. Basically 1st period was like a party. Omg I love mr. Fontenot so much! I'm kind of shy around him. The whole time I kept staring at him like there was no tomorrow. Damn he's sexy😩👅. I want to talk to him, but time I had the courage to talk to him the bell ranged it was time to go to second period. Tess and I grabbed our bags about to walk out the door.
Yn felt like she was forgetting something, she walked right back in the class room to realize she left her jacket. It was nowhere to be found. She scanned the whole class room until she seen it on Mr.Fontenot's desk. "Aw shit! Now I have to talk to him!" 😩😬😰. She thought to herself.
Mr.Fontenot was standing behind his desk once again playing on his phone not paying any attention to what was going on around him.
Yn POV
Since Mr.Fontenot is playing on his phone, maybe if I just grab the jacket he might not notice it *Carefully reaches for the jacket*
