As we were going around I decide to take a look at his thoughts. I focused but there was nothing. I thought maybe I didn't have much focus. I tried on a girl passing by and it worked, she was headed to the cinema. I shook my head and tried it on Dylan but nothing. I remembered that razeil told me that I can only read human minds and not other world beings. I gulped and now I was freaking out, who was he and was he something that I didn't know.
Hey Dylan, I said kind of nervous now. Yeah he looked at my and smiled just remembered that I have to get somewhere, I lied.
After I was out of site, I ran to the bus stop and ran home. I was so scared now, who could I trust, and what if he was a demo or devil.
And to think I started liking him.
I had to ask razeil.
