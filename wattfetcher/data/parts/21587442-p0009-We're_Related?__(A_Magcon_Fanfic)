"I wanted Ashley to come because, Ashley, I would like to invite you to Magcon!"  Bart said.  I was a little shocked, but I didn't show it.  Bart wants ME to join Magcon?  "So, will you join?"  He asked me.
"Sure!  I'd love to!"  I said, and the boys kinda celebrated but it was just little 'yays!' and high fives.
"And I requested for you to come because I wanna do a photo shoot with you, I would love to work with you!"  Bryant said.
"I'd love to!"  I said.
"Ok, how bout we do the photo shoot on Monday?  I have to do the boys on the weekend."  Bryant explains.
"Sounds good!"  I said.  We finally finish the meeting and leave the building to the limo.  Wow, I can't believe I just joined Magcon and I'm going to do my first photo shoot on Monday.  Today is Thursday, so I have a couple days.
I'm really sorry about not posting yesterday!!  My internet wasn't working and I couldn't post anything!  But expect a better chapter Friday!!
