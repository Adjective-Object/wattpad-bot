"Why did you leave your pants in the living room!?" My mom half questioned, half yelled. Her words we're terribly slurred, signaling she was drunk. She didn't even give me time to respond before she continued her rant. "I always clean up after myself." She slurred. "You leave your clothes all over the house." I said.
It was actually completely true. Whenever she came home she would just take off her clothes, sprawling them around the house.
Unexpectedly, she lunged forward, her fist connecting with my face. "Get away from me!" I yelled, backing away from her. "No!" She shouted back, her hands attaching to my shirt. She slung my body around, making me fall.
My mother continuously began to hit me & kick me. I curled up in a ball, praying that it would all go away.
My mind constantly replayed the pointless and stupid scene that occurred just a couple hours ago. When my mother finally decided she was done with me, she stormed to her room leaving me bloody and battered in the hallway floor.
For years I had been taking abuse from her. I don't know what overcame me, but I suddenly came to my breaking point. I decided that I would no longer live when an abusive, alcoholic monster anymore.
Without thinking twice, I slowly moved so that my hands we're touching the wall. I painfully pulled myself up, using the wall a support. I slowly trudged over to the stairs, my hands staying glued to the walls. I slowly managed to get myself down the stairs and out the door.
I limped across the street. The sidewalks were busy, allowing plenty of people to pass me by. No one acknowledged me or even gave me a second look.
Until one pretty woman looked me directly in the eyes. All I remember was calling out to her for help, before slipping into complete darkness.
Now I laid in a hospital bed, worrying of my fate. She had to have informed somebody what happened. They would immediately and correctly assume that I was beaten, and I would be taken from my mother to be trapped in a Foster home.
The idea made me shutter.
My eyes slowly roamed over to the left, seeing the pretty woman in juiced into her a book. I went to turn my head, not wanting her to know I was awake.
But it was too late.
Her light brown eyes came into direct contact with my green ones.
"You're awake." The pretty woman with no name said lightly, closing her book. All her attention was turned to me.
"What's gonna happen to me?" I asked shakily.
"Well." She started. "I want you to come live with me."
I gave her a bizzare look. She ignored my look and kept talking.
"I'm Kathy Tuckerman. I actually came to New York to find someone in need. I just felt to need to help someone who was less fortuned. Its quite ironic I stumbled upon you." The woman said, now owning a name.
I nodded, signaling her to continue to talk.
"I have a son named Myles. He's into football and basketball, he's a senior. What grade are you in?" Kathy asked. "I'm a junior." I responded lightly.
"Before anyone gets adopted, the foster care system always runs a background check on the adoptive parents, and they make sure the living conditions are sustainable."
I just nodded, and began to play with my fingers in my lap.
Suddenly, the door opened and a women walked in. "Finally, you're awake." She said. "I'm Dr. Jauge." The doctor said, extending her hand to me. I politely shook it and introduced myself. "I'm Maylem."
