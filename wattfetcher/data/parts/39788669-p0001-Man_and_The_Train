I jumped happily up and down. I can't wait to see them again! I checked my watch, 12:25. A few more minutes!!! They're going to be so surprised to see me! Calm down, Hannah.
I look way from my thoughts, and to the train station instead. I look to the left, to found a guy standing there, that wasn't there before. He looked about my age, around 25, maybe... Knowing that I could creep him out, I moved on to something else to look at. But my mind kept wondering about the man. I look at  him from a sideways glance, and saw that he had a shiny, black briefcase.
He could be a business man? ... His clothes though.... The briefcase though.... My mind, stopped thinking, when I heard the sound of a train. I look down the track, smiling, to see the 12:30 train coming it's way. I turn to left, when I felt something clang to my arm. I see the man handcuffing me to his briefcase, but it all went to fast to ask a question. He shaved a mobile phone into my hand as he muttered, Sorry, and threw himself under the train.
