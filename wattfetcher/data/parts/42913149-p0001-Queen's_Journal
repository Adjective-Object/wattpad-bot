This journal belongs to Queen Rosie, if found please don't read!___________Sophomore year is over! I'm homework free and free to stay at home and sleep. But that won't do, so I've decide to instead go on a walk everyday for a whole hour, and write down what I think. You see when I'm walking this inspirational thoughts and doubts about life and reflections always come to me, for example, I sometimes wonder what if humans where suppose to fly instead of walk, or what if the animals where to talk?! I know what you're thinking I'm a little bit mad in the head, but that's just how I am, and in my opinion is not, I'm just a little bit curious how everything came to be, and why is it that way.
