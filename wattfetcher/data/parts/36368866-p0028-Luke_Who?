"C'mon we need to report this." Luke says as he exits my room. I follow him out the door. He inspects my car before telling me to get the keys.
We talk to the police about this. Even though there's not a whole lot they can do since my observations are basically useless. A black civic car with no license plate and an unidentified driver. I feel Luke tense up with I mention the car but he's probably just getting mad at the jerk.
"We'll do what we can. For now, continue to drive safe and call us if you see this car again." The officer says before we leave.
"Was that description true? The car had no license plate?" Luke asks once we are back in my car and leaving the station.
"Yeah. Which I find really weird. Not only is a hit and run illegal but I'm certain driving a car without a license plate is illegal too." Luke nods in agreement but I can tell my confirmation only made him stiffen.
"Do you work tomorrow?" Funny he should ask this.
"No. Lucy, my boss, is giving me the day off since she has a family thing to attend to." I respond blankly. He doesn't say anything but just nods again. I wonder if he knows about what happened. But that's stupid.
How could Luke know anything about this? Maybe it was some crazy paparazzi dude who found me out. But that didn't make since either. Our bother-sister relationship has only just been made known to us. Well to me. He's said that no one knows I'm his sister though. Paparazzi, it can't be.
"What's going on Luke? Do you know something about this?" It was a valid question in my point of view, but he found it funny.
"Of course not Katie. Don't be stupid." That just made me shrink in my seat. His comment was supposed to be lighthearted but it still felt like a major slap in the face. For two reasons. He made me feel like a complete moron for asking. He also just lied to me.
