(A/N: Leena and her mother speak in Arabic but I'll translate their conversation for you since many of the readers don't understand Arabic)
"why didn't you answer! I almost had a heart attack" She almost blew up my ear-drums
"calm down mom! As-salamu Alaykom, and sorry I'm in the mall I didn't hear it"
"Forget about that, How are you? how is it going there?" She asked worriedly
Oh fine mom, I'm in a school where boys sit beside me and touch me 'sometimes' even out of school, so I punch or slap them 'sometimes'. thanks for letting me go to the karate classes. by the way, the family I was supposed to live with, has been changed, so now Im living with a hot boy around my age who keeps flirting with me and tries to sneek into my room at night 'sometimes', but don't worry I always lock the door, It's Okay we're not alone. his mother, who I barely see, lives with us, and his sister does too.
But for sure, I wasn't gonna say that.
Thoughts rushed in my brain and the shaitaan took this chance to disturb and distract me.
mind: tell her !
shaitaan: Don't tell her.
mind: Just say the truth.
shaitaan :No don't, If she tells your father he will drag you back.
mind: Don't lie! It's wrong! you've always been honest.
shaitaan: It won't hurt If she doesn't know everything ...
"I'm fine mom" that was all what I managed to say, It really won't hurt if she doesn't know everything ...
"How's your new family"
"not as good as my old one" some tears escaped from my eyelides and I heard mom sobbing
"I miss you" I sniffed
"We do too, I can't believe that there is no one to bother us everyday" She tried to hide her sobs by laughing
"So you immediately packed your bags and went on a vacation ha? you really do miss me, I see that you jumped at the chance and went to Turkey, I've always wanted to go there. Why didn't you tell me" I chuckled
"Your father had an important meeting for his work, and he couldn't leave me alone" she explained
"excuses, excuses...." I rolled my eyed though she can't see me
"Leena the cheeta, We're getting old here" Lewis shouted
"Mom, I need to go, talk to you later, I love you Salaam"
"Allah ma'ake habibty (may allah be with you, my love)" she hung up
"Leena the cheeta?" I raised an eyebrow at the idiot in front of me
"yeah, both of you are beautiful but dangerous with fast reactions" he winked and Elina bursted out laughing and I tried to hide my laugh
"come on admit it, I'm hilarious, wild cheeta"
"It's not funny anymore *short pause* you're not leaving aren't you?" Elina and Lewis shook their heads. eventually I gave up and followed them to the shop.
Did I just lie to mom ?
shaitaan: No girl! absolutely not, you just didn't say the whole truth
I should've told mom everything and faced all the consequences .
A/N: sorry it sucks but I had no time ...
