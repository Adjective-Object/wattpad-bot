"Ms. Aaliyah, I am a huge fan of your music."
"Really Lance?"
"Yeah. One in a Million is my favorite from you. Well, it is actually hard to choose," he continues.
"Well I'm flattered. Hey, let's get this photoshoot going, shall we?" Aaliyah mentions smiling. It is amazing how wonderful her smile is. She is just a beauty. She walks past us along with her crew. Lance out of nowhere gets hyped again.
He exclaims, "Oh. My. Gosh! Dude! Did you see that? She is a perfect dime! We are about to take pictures with the princess of r&b!"
"She's alright I guess," I reply while shrugging my shoulders.
He then looks at me serious. "Oh c'mon Justin. I saw the way you was looking at her. You can't deny it. It is impossible to deny it! Just say it; I, Lance Bass, was right. And you, Justin Timberlake, was wrong."
I look down. "Alright, alright. You are right."
"Thank you Se√±or Timberlake. Now will you excuse me as I am about to use the bathroom." Lance rushes pass me in a hurry.
But--I know he is lying--because he just used the bathroom before we got here.
"You are going to ask for her autograph aren't you?" I shout.
"You know it!" He shouts back, running even faster. All I can do is laugh at him. I don't blame Lance though.

Aaliyah's P. O. V
My hair stylist straightens the last piece of my hair and my eyes land on the mirror. She always do a great job.
Alana asks me, "Now how could a pretty girl like you be single?"
I answer, "I'm just not looking forward to being in a relationship right now. Especially since the guys I run into only want one thing from me."
"What, money?"
"No! Haha! Sex Alana," I respond, laughing. "Even though I have that too."
"Not all guys only want one thing," she tell me, spinning me around to face her.
"True but, I just don't wanna date right now," I say, standing up. "My career is more important at this point."
"Alright girl! That is the way to think. Don't eva let no guy dog you out just because he hit and split it and not want to claim the child which he made and have other baby mommas and pay child support for them and not you and try to come back into your life again saying that he loves you and he was wrong and-"
"Woah! Woah! Woah! That ain't gonna happen with me. Are you alright Alana," I cut off frightened. Her face looks angry and I can tell she is hurt.
"Yeah I'm cool Liyah. You know me; all I need is some Jerry Springer and some vodka." I give her a hug and walk out the door, closing it from behind me.
"And apparently another baby daddy too."
I meet up with the two members of Nsync again. The photographer approaches all three of us.
He announces, "Hey fabulous people. So, before we get started, I want to point some things out. I want great chemistry from you guys like you have done this before. Also, sexiness and humor to spice it up kay? Kay. Now, let's finally get this started."
