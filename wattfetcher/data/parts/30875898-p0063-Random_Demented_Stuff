They scream at me, "You are so weak!"
They shout at me, "Just go and bleed"
But I will not give in, I will stay song
Even though death has been on my mind for so fucking long
They try and get my to close my eyes
But what they don't know is I would rather die
They try and tell me to go to sleep
But I tell myself sleep is for the weak
And when they finally get me to close my eyes
I will whisper, "I'll catch up on my sleep when I die..."
