"Sam?" Cas asked.
"Fucking shit," Dean said. "I forgot Sam works in Vegas."
"Wait, I'm sorry, Sam, Sam Winchester, Sam, your brother, Sam?"
"Yeah, that's him."
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!" Cas exclaimed. "We have to get the story of our wedding we were too drunk to remember from your brother. Is that what you're telling me?"
"It seems that way."
So they went to talk to Sam.
And of course, Sam had documented most of it in pictures by the witness, Hannah. Ironically, Hannah was Cas' sister.
"Oh fucking hell, I'll never live this down," Cas said.
"You? Have you met Sam?" Dean asked.
"Yeah, yours is worse," Cas admitted.
"So, now we ask Meg?" Dean suggested.
"I don't think that's necessary, but okay," Cas replied, thinking of the conversation they had this morning.
And so, they finally talked to Meg.
"And that's it, boys," she said when she finished telling them about their night (well, what she could hear).
"Well, Cas, when you hear the whole thing, it's really sweet," Dean admitted after Meg had left.
"It really is, isn't it?"
"Cas?"
"Yeah, Dean?"
"Can we stay married?"
"Oh, thank God. I thought I'd have to divorce you."
They laughed together.
"I love you, Cas."
"I love you, too, Dean."
And the married life was fantastic.

Because it's nice to end on an "I love you."
