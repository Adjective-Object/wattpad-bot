"Me?" the guy at the other line said, sounding surprised.




Nodding to myself, I spoke, "Yeah. ...Who...are you, exactly?"




The other end of the line fell silent again. Causing me to wonder if the person was still there. "Hello?" I said to make sure.




"I'm......Canada." he replied in a low voice.




"Uhm...sorry, what?" I asked in a confused tone. Then, I suddenly remembered that guy earlier who looked like Luciano. He...called me, "(Name)", too, right? He also introduced himself as, "Italy", a country name. What gives?




"Don't you......remember me?" he asked me, his voice sounded like it was cracking at the end.




Starting to feel a pang of guilt, I replied slowly. "I.....don't. I'm sorry..."





"H-How about 'Matthew Williams'? ...Does that ring a bell?" he asked me hopefully. His name was strikingly similar to Matthieu, but I absolutely doubt that it's the same person, judging from that voice. This person's...completely different. I'm trying to recall if I do know him, but...I just...




Sighing, I responded. "No....sorry. I...really don't remember..."




"You...seriously don't remember me..." the guy said, sounding really hurt.




I suddenly felt really bad when I heard him say that. "I....Have—Have we...met before? Am I...supposed to remember you?" I asked him, my head starting to ache from all the confusion and the driving emotions.
