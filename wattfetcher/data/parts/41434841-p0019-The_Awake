I guess I'm dealing with the awake alone now. I'm about to just ask Jordan to leave. Every time I need to talk he's asleep or doing something lately. Which I mean is fine because idk. It's just fine. I don't care anymore. Jay doesn't talk to me anymore. Bill just seems like the only thing he wants to do is fuck me. Those two aren't people if trust myself to open up to. I'm just tired. I want to be home.
