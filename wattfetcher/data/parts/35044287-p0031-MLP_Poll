I'm actually surprise it lasted this long. I honestly thought I would of have gotten out like maybe 3 chapters ago. Well if you voted this song out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started.
And the nominees are:
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME: A song about Rainbow, Flutters, Pinkie, Aj, and Rarity get their cutie mark switched. S: 3 Ep: 13
