I rolled my eyes.
"Austin we got to go!" TIno shouted.
"Give me five more minutes!" I called back.
"Nope we got to go!"
Alan sighed and sat up, "Go and do your interview. I'll be right here when you get back. Or at the venue."
"Okay, I'll see you later."
"See you later."
I got out of his bunk and smiled, "Bye my sexy ginger."
"Bye Aust," He said laughing a little.  I walked out from the bunks and saw an impatient Tino.
"Ready?" I asked him.
"Yeah. Now lets go. They're waiting backstage."
"Okay, okay let's go."
We walked in backstage and to our someone dressing room where a guy was sitting waiting for us. He looked up just as we walked in and smiled at us.
"Sorry we're late."
"Oh it's fine, we were still setting everything up anyways."
"Okay." I said. "Well lets do this."
"Sounds good." He said and showed us where to stand.
The interview was going smoothly until he asked about the picture.
"So Austin, a lot of fans have been asking about the picture of this ginger you were kissing. Care to explain?" He asked.
"Oh, uh it's nothing." I said instantly regretting it. Tino looked over at me curiously but said nothing.
"Well people are wondering who he is, so who is he?"
"He's nothing. Just nobody important."
"He's our photographer for the tour." Tino said still looking at me like I'm crazy.
"Yeah, he's important I mean he's our photographer." I said nervously. God I just blew everything.
"Oh okay, well just a few more questions and we'll be done."
The rest of it went by quick and soon Tino and I were walking back to the bus.
"Why didn't you tell him about Alan being your boyfriend?" Tino asked on the way back.
"Its a new relationship. I don't want people getting in the way."
"Yeah, but you said he was just nothing and unimportant."
"I know! And when he watches it he's going to hate me! I fucked up Tino."
"Yes you did." He said just as we got to the bus,  "And when he sees it you better figure out what you're going to tell him.
"What if I told him now? Would that be stupid?"
"Maybe, I don't know. It's up to you."
"Come on you have to help me with this."
"No, it's your mess you figure it out."
"You think waiting till it comes out is stupid. I'm gonna tell him." I said.
"Good for you." Tino said opening the door, the two of us walked in slamming the door shut.
"Alan!?"
"Yeah?" He called from the bunks. I walked back and saw him still there on his computer.
"What are you doing?" I asked sitting across from him.
