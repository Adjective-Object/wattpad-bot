"Aunt Tessa, we need to go see daddy pigs." Tyler says snapping my eyes back to everybody. "Okay, let's go." I say cheerfully. We go the daddy pigs which are on the other side of the farm. "Here we are." I say throwing my hands up. The kids go off and the others go and make sure they don't get hurt. I'm about to walk up to Oreo and Chip's father Tater Tot when Malaki grabbed my jacket. "Whatcha need buddy ?" I say kneeling down to face him, since he's on his walker. "I wanna have a movie night. Can we?" He says his brown eyes sparkling with hope. Awwwwww! How can you not say no. "Of course. Let's finish up here, take baths, and eat lunch, then we can." I say happy. Maybe Liam can come over then. He races off and goes to his pig Buttercup. "Well, you certainly are the best aunt there is." A voice says behind me. "Oh my god. Ryan don't do that! " I say checking my wrist for a pulse. He laughs and pets Tater Tot. "So, movie night, eh? " he says being his cocky self. "Yup, and guess what? " I say petting Tater Tot. His brows furrow in confusion and shrugs. "Pinocchio, beyotch." I say as he gasps. "You remembered ?" He says as KC come over. "Hellz yeah, I did." I smile. "Well, I remember when you swore to Mrs.Porter that when you have a kid, you'll teach them to say ain't." He says sitting down in the office. I sit down with him and watch my family help my friends. "Oh my god, I did swore that. Same with their middle name is gonna be Dangerous. " I say facepalmimg. "Yeah, and I backed you up saying that my kid's name is gonna Crazy." He says as I get out my secret stash of oreos. I offer him some and he takes some. "Thanks." He says staring me in me eyes. "For what ?" I say breaking the gaze. "For helping me get over Jenna." He says holding my hand.Â  I just nod. I check the microwave and see that it's 12:00 pm. I mutter a curse and stand up. "What's wrong ?" He asks standing up with me. "It's lunch time." I say going out of the office, him following close behind. "C'mon guys! Time for lunch !" I say gathering everybody.
