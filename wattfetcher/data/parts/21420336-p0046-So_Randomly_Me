I will kill someone
You guys know I'm capable of this
Gosh my sassy dolphins
You guys are the only ones who understand me XD
My poor Nutella is probably expired
I'm avoiding throwing it out
It's sad really
It's just.... There
Like... Begging
Ugh
Life is so complicated XD

But she regret it.

We had a gas leak at school today
I had like three small panic attacks
Fun.
I missed two hours of school.
Even funner.
