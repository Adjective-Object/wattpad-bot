Don't worry about me, don't wipe these tears off of me
This is what she writes before she's gone
This is what she writes before she falls
She tied the rope around her neck
It was still sore from her past practices
She stands upon the the dining chair
Sets everything up with delicate care
Her tears fall to the floor
She hears a knock on the door
"Sweety, can you let me in?"
"Yeah its open, just walk on in."
Walking into the door, I saw a grizzly sight
And it still haunts me every night
