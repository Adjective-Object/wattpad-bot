"Well... what if he comes onto me?"
"He won't if he has a boyfriend."
"And if he doesn't?" I asked taking a seat on the couch next to Tino, "What about then?"
He sighed, "There is no stopping you is there?"
I smiled and shook my head, "Nope."
"If he has a boyfriend you leave him alone though."
"Maybe." I said.
He glared at me and shook his head and walked off.
"He's right." Phil said, "You know if you try anything and he does something, it's cheating and I doubt he wants to do that."
I sighed dramatically, "But he's so cute! How can I not?"
"Shouldn't someone being a relationship stop you altogether."
I shrugged, "Not really."
He shook his head, "What are we going to do with you?"
"I have no idea." I said getting up, "I'm going back to my bunk now." I informed them and started heading back when I heard sobs coming from the bathroom. I knocked lightly on the door. "Hey is everything okay in here?"
"Shit, uh yeah e-everythings fine." I heard Alan say.
"Are you sure?"
The door swung open and revealed a puffy eyed Alan, "Mhm, do you need to be in here?" He said moving out of the way.
I shook my head, "No, I'm going on to my bunk. Are you sure you're okay?" I asked, "You can talk to me if you want."
"Just stupid relationships or whatever. It doesn't matter."
"LIke I said, if you need to talk you can talk to me. I'm sort of a relationship guru." I told him ignoring Tinos snort from the front of the bus.
"Relationship guru?"
"Yes relationship guru." I said smiling  a little.
"Okay, thanks-" His phone rang again and he looked at me, "I got to, yeah."
I shrugged, "Alright just know the offer stands." I told him before going to my bunk.  I laid in my bunk and went on twitter retweeting a few things from fans before I got bored. I didn't feel like being around the guys because they all just scolded me about Alan. It was kind of annoying that they all seemed to think I can't keep my dick in my pants or something.
"Don't say th- Roy. Please I still lov-"
I peeked out of my bunk and saw Alan standing there looking completely heartbroken.
"No! Please don't." He begged, his voice cracking a little, "You don't mean that. No, please bab-" Alan sighed and threw his phone onto his bunk and wiped his eyes.
"Okay, what happened?" I asked looking at him. He jumped and looked at me shaking his head.
"It's nothing."
I gave him a bitch please look, "Come on, let the relationship guru hear your problems." I said.
"My now ex is an asshole and broke up with me because I came on tour with you guys."
I scoffed, "Why would he break up with you over something like that?" I asked.
"Because I was going to be around other guys for awhile and he wasn't going to be there."
