Fifty Shades--Don't bring it up.

Some of you are harassing me, in my story and in my inbox about how crappy I am for having a negative opinion about fifty shades of grey.

My opinion on this:

-I don't have any respect for E.L James book. Period. It's not my cup of tea.

-I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. I'm straight up voicing my opinion and offering my advice. You can take it or leave it. That's your decision. I respect you in that.


** I REPEAT :This work IS NOT a good representation of my writing**

Warning: This story will be misogynistic. If you're a feminist please don't read this story. The female roles are in a  powerless position. It will drive you mad.

Theresa Rivers is near graduation. She attends a high school catered towards a prestigious crowd.  A school for students that are future heirs of companies, enterprises and just in general rich backgrounds from all over the country.
Theresa harbours a quiet presence amongst them, and hardly is ever in the spotlight.
She have some friends and they share the same background.
Her class: economically lower than average, as she partially supports herself, by working part time along side of school.
This isn't an issue until one of the top male students discovers her  at her job, and blatantly informs her of the consequences.
Expulsion from the school.
This particular student has suddenly taken matters into his own hands, and begins to threaten her future at the cost of not spreading her secret.
His name: Lucius Hawthorne, and at first he was one of few very admirable to her.
With every dark persuasion Lucius pulls,  she is forced to accept his conditions and it eventually it leads them both...to the unexpected.
