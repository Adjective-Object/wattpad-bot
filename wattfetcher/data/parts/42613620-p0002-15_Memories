I said "Mommy loves you too!"

~3 YEARS LATER~
(still in mothers P.O.V.)
I saw Rose making breakfast for my husband and me. She had made grilled cheese and 2 glasses or orange juice, on a plate. She called both of us to the kitchen and set us on chairs. She walked out with 2 plates of grilled cheese and 2 orange juice cups.
I said "Wow, what a nice breakfast you have there!"
She smiled and said "Welp! I wanted to make you something! because you are the best parents ever!"
My husband said "Well thank you! We will eat it right away!"
She smiled and put the plates on the table and walked out the door. I followed her out the door with my eyes and I said to my husband "She is something else!"
My husband coughed and said "I think i'm coming down with something."
I said "Oh sweety! stay in bed! I don't want you to get wose!
Little did she know, her world was going to crash down on her.
~1 YEAR LATER~
(STILL IN MOTHERS P.O.V.)
" NOOO! SWEETY DONT DIE ON ME!!! MY RAY OF SUNSHINE!! NOOOO!"
*beep beep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep* *Flat line*
"NOOOOOO!!!!!!" I sobbed
My daughter came in and saw the flat line she was only 5 but she knows what it meant.
She said "M-M-Mommy? I-I-Is Daddy....D-D-D-DEAD?!"
I glared at her and said "YES! HE IS DEAD! AND ITS ALL YOUR FAULT! IF YOU DIDNT MAKE THAT FOOD HE WOULDNT HAVE DIED!"
She looked at me in horror and said "I caused daddy to die? I am a killer?" she walked out of the room and didn't look back.

TO BE CONTUINED!
