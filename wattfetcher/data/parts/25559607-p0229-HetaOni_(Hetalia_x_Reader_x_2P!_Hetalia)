Also, I'll say this one more time, HetaOni was largely based off  'Aooni' by noprops.

Please refrain from claiming that HetaOni has any connection with the makers of Aooni so as not to inconvenience them.

HetaOni was created by Tomoyoshi.

The English conversations we have in this fanfic are from the English version  of HetaOni by Pianodream and Neokyno.

This Reader Insert was largely based off that. The concept of the 2Ps involved in HetaOni, as well as the reader insert plot are by flamehazelollipop. Also, the story will incorporate her theories about the game's plot and possible endings.



Well, now, see you in Chapter 12.


I hope you, Reader-chan, will be watching over us and reading Author-chan's HetaOni (Hetalia x Reader x 2P!Hetalia)  fanfic until we can escape from here together."
