"Thanks guys."He said."Now get dressed we're going to the beach @3,"Ava replies.Hayes walks upstairs and I get the guy.Shawn's P.O.V.I really like Mia.So I'm going to ask Nash a question."Hey Nash,"I say."Yeah Shawn?"Nash asks."I was asking if I could take Mia on a date tomorrow,"I say."Finally you've worked up the courage to ask Mia.But hurt her I hurt you,"he says all serious and I nod.I might also ask her to be my girlfriend.Nash P.O.V.I'm so excited Shawn worked up the courage to ask Mia on a date.But I'm also asking Mia what happened.If this boy asks her out.I will buy her Taco Bell for a month or two because of how happy she will be since the plane crash.          📱Mia's P.O.V.📱"Hey Mia,"a guy said.I then turn around to see Shawn."Hey Shawn you frickin scared me,"I say."Mia will you please go on a date with me tomorrow?"Shawn asks."Yassss!!!!!"I scream."Whats going on here?"The guys question."Shawn asked me on a date."I say."Shawn get some,"Taylor says.-skip to party for Hayes-"All MagCon come here we're asking Mia and Hayes a question,Nash says,"Mia,Hayes would you 2 like to join MagCon?"They ask.Me and Hayes look at each other and scream,"Yass!!!"We then run over to the cake and start cutting it.Hayes takes where it says 'Hayes'.I took where it says 'Happy'.Then Hayes starts opening the presents he got a:•Go pro camera-Nash•Scripture Bracelet-Mia•Vans-Taylor & Carter•ITunes gift card-Cameron•Snapbacks-Shawn and Matt•Laptop-Mom and Dad•Football-Jack & JackThat's all he got then we went home and watched 'The Conjuring'.I sat in between Shawn and Taylor.Every time something scary showed up I would always hide into Shawn.I then got sleepy and put my head on Shawn's shoulder and stayed up until sleep took over my body.I then felt somebody carry me upstairs."Goodnight princess,"Shawn says and then kisses my forehead.I know it was him because I know his voice from anyone.
