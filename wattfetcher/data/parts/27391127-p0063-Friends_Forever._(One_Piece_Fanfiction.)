Hello minna! I'm sorry but I felt like the last chapter kinda sucked because I was feeling down. Anyways, this chappy. There's a video to be played for later on and a dialogue. Kinda missed not doing the one last chappy. Well here you go!

T'was Monday night. Nay, it was a holiday night before a staff meeting the next day.

The captain of the Straw Hats decided that it was best for their friends to spend the night over although half of them (including some of the crew) had to got to the staff meeting the next day.

Unfortunately, kid had something to do with his crew, Ace was out with his friends and Sabo well........

The trio  of friends came as they would gladly like to spend time with them however, Law was forced to come against his will mainly because of the alliance. His crew spent the night at a casino playing poker.

"I would much rather be at the casino with my crew, Mugiwara-ya." Law bitterly complained, sitting crossed-legged on one of the Straw Hat's many plush cushions.

"Then why did you come?" Aya asked.

"That idiot sent Nami-ya and Nose-ya to kidnap me with Sea Prism Stone handcuffs and chain and they literally dragged me here." Law answered. An irk mark already showing up on his forehead.

"Oi Traffy! Are you enjoying yourself!" Luffy asked excitedly from the kitchen with a fresh piece of meat in his mouth.

The irk marks began multiplying on Law's head, "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this fucking dorm!"

Aya then slapped him.


"I feel sad."
"Why?"
"Because Ace isn't here."
"Too bad."
"And why do you have the bracelet? It's not fair!"
"Its fair enough, I fine." Sakura answered with a smirk.

"Saki-chan!"
"Say my name properly!"
"Come eat meat with me!" Luffy asked.
"Meat?!" Sakura exclaimed with sparkles.
"Yeah, Sanji is cooking some but he won't give so can you ask for me?"
"Of course!" Sakura answered before speeding off.

"Dumbass."  Haruka whispered.
"Nami, is everyone here?" Luffy asked.
"Well, everyone expect Ace and Kid."
"Nobody wants that red head!" Aya shouted.
"I agree. He pisses me off." Law answered quietly.
