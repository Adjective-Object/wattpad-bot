The crowd started cheering. No one can hear me say anything except with the mic.
" What is up ladies and gentlemen?"
The screams started to get louder. Alex, Bryce, and Tiranan are giving me a thumbs up signaling that they are ready.
" Do you guys remember us? We are the."
Everyone screamed, " The Cover Ups!"
We started clapping.
" 3. 2. 1. Lets get this concert started!"
SHAWN MENDES LYRICS-STITCHES
I thought that I've been hurt beforeBut no one's ever left me quite this soreYour words cut deeper than a knifeNow I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going underBut I know that I'll make it out aliveIf I quit calling you my lover andMove on
You watch me bleed until I can't breatheShaking, falling onto my kneesAnd now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitchesTripping over myself,Aching, begging you to come helpAnd now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flameOh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the painYour bitter heart cold to the touchNow I'm gonna reap what I sowI'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going underBut I know that I'll make it out aliveIf I quit calling you my lover andMove on
You watch me bleed until I can't breatheShaking, falling onto my kneesAnd now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitchesTripping over myself,Aching, begging you to come helpAnd now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches
[3x]Needle and the thread,Gotta get you out of my headNeedle and the thread,Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread,Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breatheI'm shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)And now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)Tripping over myself,Aching, begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please.")And now that I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches
(And now that)I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches(And now that)I'm without your kissesI'll be needing stitches
" Thanks everyone for coming! I hope you will enjoy the rest of the concert."
