Owen heard his cellphone going off as he drove to the main center with Theo, no one was picking up their radios.
"Hello?" he answered. He heard his father in law.
"Alan, what's going on..."
Theo saw his father's face become panicked before he slammed on the brakes and threw the car into reverse.
"I'm heading there now." he said before hanging up. Owen looked over at him, his eyes pained before he focused back on the road.
They arrived to the Bungalow to see the front door open. Owen jumped out of the car along with Theo, they ran in to see it emptied but overturned.
Athena wasn't moving either.
Theo checked her pulse as his father ran through all the rooms. Athena was still breathing.
"She's not here." Owen said. "We have to find her, we have to get in contact with the others. Segura and his men are here."

Keira ran as fast as she could through the trees, her heart was pounding in her chest and her breathing was becoming labored but she didn't dare slow down, not with men with guns chasing her. She thought she heard a car in the distance but she had to avoid the main road, she wasn't sure how many men Segura had on the island already.
She finally came to her destination running into the gate before opening it holding her breath. She heard chirps behind her. She turned her head panting.
"Wanna go for a walk, Blue?"
