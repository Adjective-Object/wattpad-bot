" nice try sweet heart " he said taking the beanie back and putting it back on his head the way he had  it  then he pulled me into a passionate kiss I smiled through the kiss and tugged at the ends of his hair and he let out a small moan in my mouth  which made me smirk as we deepened the kiss then we fell on the bed and  he slid his hands down my back and stopped at my hips and   he pulled away for air which is what we both needed  but we didn't want it
" god I love you" justin whispered
"   I love you too"  I whispered
