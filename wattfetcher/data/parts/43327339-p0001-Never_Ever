Payton P.O.V:
My alarm clock goes off. It's 6:30 in the morning why do I have to wake up this early?!?!
Oh I forgot school.
I get up and brush my teeth and take a 25 minute shower. I lotion up my body and put on my clothes ( in the MM and that's me😘😉...like the selfie of the day?).
Let me formally introduce my self.
My name is Payton Dawson. I was born on March 21, 2000. Do the math to guess how old I am. My height is 5'7 and I'm Black and Hispanic. I have a good side and a bad side. The good side come from my grandparents and my bad come straight up from my mom.My father died when I was 3 so, you know the deal.
Anyway I can't wait till my nigga Kai come pick me up.
This is my first book and I'm not letting no one bring me down.
