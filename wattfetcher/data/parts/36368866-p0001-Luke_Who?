My head burned as I laid curled up on the sidewalk. My lip was dripping blood thanks to the cut that split it open. I could tell by the taste in my mouth. I rubbed my stomach in an attempt to sooth the pain.
"Yo Katie where are you? Oh my- someone call 911!" Who ever said that seemed miles away. Yet they reached me in a short time brushing hair away from my face.
"Jordan!" The blurry figure screamed. She still seemed to be screaming from the end of town..not in front of me.
"Ambulance is on their way!" I heard someone else scream.
My head swam as I laid there. Whoever was sitting in front of me kept talking to me. Kept asking me to stay with them. I was assuming tears were pouring out of me..I was too numb to feel anything.
My vision was getting blurrier by the second and soon the girl in front of me was beginning to get blocked out by blackness.
"No! Katie! Stay with me!" The girl screamed. I tried to speak but when I opened my mouth nothing came out.
Soon darkness overlapped me. Then I was pulled back into the light when my body was being lifted. I wanted to fight but I was too weak.
My eyes opened a crack. Enough to see the swirling, blurry red and blue lights. Ambulance.
A small prick to my left arm made me wince. Someone put something around my mouth and nose..an..oxygen tank. My head was hurting too badly to know what was really going on.
"You'll be okay baby. Just hang on a little longer." Someone whispered into my ear. I felt the surface under me move and the lights got closer. I was lifted once again and set back down in the back of the ambulance.
The doors were shut. And my eyes closed once again.
--Okay! Hi :)
This is a going to be about my boy Luke Hemmings. However, it's NOT a love story. You'll see what I mean when I get more chapters out.
I'm excited for this. And I will continue my other stories but I got this idea and HAD to write it down. Hopefully you guys stay to read till the end. (I'll try not to make it to boring and lame!)
