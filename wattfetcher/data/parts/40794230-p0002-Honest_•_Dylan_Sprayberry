I cried even harder and my sobs became louder. I couldn't stand doing that to my aunt so I turned away and ran back to my cousin. I wrapped my arms around his neck and sobbed into his neck.
"Please don't leave me." I whispered, my voice cracking at the end. The first time talking since I got the news. He started sobbing uncontrollably and nodded.
"I won't. Ever."

That was six months ago.
My name is Nicole Posey. I am cousins with Tyler Posey.
My father, James Posey, was my uncle John's brother. Now that's the problem, my uncle looks like my father, so much that it hurts too even look at him. It brings back so many memories that I promised myself I would forget after the.....accident. I am not one of those depressed teenagers who self harms themselves in any possible way they can find. They wouldn't want me to be that way, so I stayed away from that as much as possible.
Ever since the tragedy of September 2nd, 2014, I have been living with my uncle and my aunt. But after December 12 that same year, I have only been living with John. Why? Because my family, is dead.
But my whole life changed with a phone call and plane ticket.
