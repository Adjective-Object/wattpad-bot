Pepper's POVClinging of metal and ice cold water splashing me on my face made me wake up gasping and coughing I heard the Doctor laugh as the metal night stick continued sliding across the cell bars I wass in making my head pound. CLINK CLINK CLINK, CLANG CLANG BANG!! I watched as the docter in a white lab coat writing something on her clip board as the gaurd continued to make the rattling noise, making my head ach even more. I stood up and wrapped my wings around my cold body which added warmth to help me warm up from the ice cold water. Dr. Lacy continued scratching away at her clip board with her pen, I watched as the gaurd grew board and put away his night stick then cross his arms and stand beside Dr.Lacy. I moved to the bars as Dr. Lacy looked me over her pushing her glasses farther on the bridge of her nose taking a deep breath then place her hands behind her back hiding the clip board "good news Spicy, you will be joined by two other chosen in training." I felt bad for the people that would join me that Dr.Lacy called 'chosen'. I was 'chosen when I was ten more like kidnapped I was in the kitchen making lunch when I heard the screetch of tires and I smelled burned rubber then the front door bang open, before I could move men dressed in black uniforms with S.W.A.T. masks on pressed a cloth over my mouth and nose. when I woke up I was in a 'hospital' more of a exspermint lab. Before I realized what the mad scientist did the shoved needles in my skin admiting some kind of chemical, weeks later my wings started growing. "two brothers they shall join you today in fact you shall have breakfast with them. Now understand this they havn't......how shall I say this?..........evolved....yes they havn't evolved yet. you shall inform them how useless it is to try and escape, and also how rebellion leads to punishment, understand?" before I cold answer she smiled "good." I glared at the woman I hated she smiled and the gaurd opened my cell I had occupied since a week ago because I couldn't keep up with training. "now Spice no tears." Dr.Lacy said as she lead me up the many stairs to the floor I lived on, ever since I came here they never called me by my real name, and since I fought constantly which was considered 'rebellion' they called me Spice, Spicy, Pepper, Saucy, Chilly, Chilly pepper, and any thing they could think of that was hot and made your eyes water and burned eventully since I've been here for five years I forgot my real name, I've forgotten what sunshine looks like, I've forgotten what a friend is, the only thing I havn't forgotten is my Mom's face. I followed Dr.Lacy to the rather large room with a lot of tables and chairs that looked like a caffiteria. "Now I will see you in training Chilly and I exspect full corroperation okay?.....okay. now the two others will join you soon." I walked to the lunch line where a young scientist who had long silky black hair and almond shaped eyes she smiled at me that looked ginuine but being here five years taught me all the smiles where fake. she served up breakfast on a plate and handed me orange juice I found a random table and folded my wings behind me and started eating. when I heard the doors open I almost choked on my food, I didn't look up when I heard Dr. Silk's voice boom in fake happiness maybe it was real happiness but knowing what they did to me I don't see how any human being could be happy by doing that to another human being. I continued eating as Dr.Silk intruduced Missy the caffiteria lady to the 'chosen' then I heard foot steps coming my way, "Ah miss Spice good to see you up." I seen as Dr. Silk's hand came out to pat my wings I smacked his hand away with blinding quickness. I glared in to the black eyes of Dr. Silk and he offered a smile, "now don't be feisty." I felt stares from the two others and sadness for them "any ways I'm sure Dr.Lacy informed you of....of our nes residents?" I didn't glance at them as I turned back to my food I didn't want to see the two helpless humans that they would torchure and turn in to monsters like me. "Spice after informing Larry, and Lucas you will report to training understand." Dr.Silk's voice was cold. I continued eating as Dr.Silk sighed, I didn't like anything about Dr. Silk it was his hands that shoved the needles in my arms. I heard the two chairs across from me scrape against the floor and two people sit down and start eating "I'll see you all later." Dr. Silk said and I wanted to strangle him as he hurried out of the caffiteria. I glared as the doors closed, A throat cleared itself and feeling dread I finially looked at the two humans one was about my age and rather handsome with light brown hair and dark lashes ad eyebrows, the other was about ten a mini of his older brother. They looked at me exspectantly, I looked at Missy who was washing dishes, I rubbed the back of my neck not wanting to tell them about the torchure thay would have to go through, "well...um..I'm Lucas." the older one said "and this is....um my brother Larry." I turned my gaze to Larry who offered a shy smile then continued digging into his food, I felt a sting in my eyes as I remebered how vulnerble I was at the age I was so naive I had no idea what was coming, I sighed sadly then looked back at Lucas "you don't want to be here." I said glaring at Missy as she smiled at us and waved before walking to the restroom. "have they.....injected you  yet?" I asked my voice cracked "what?" Lucas said confused I sighed and shook my head "these people they do horrble things to you.....don't stop fighting back no matter what the punishment keep fighting every day fight back and rebel, you'll get out of here, you have to." I said quietly "uummm. okay?" Lucas said scratching his head "you don't want to stay here, once they inject you.....you won't be able to go back home." I said meeting his gaze "what do you mean?" Larry asked "what I mean is these people will turn you into monsters if you don't get out before they inject you." I said "but your not a monster." Larry said I half laughed half sighed at how naive he was but I knew as soon as he seen my wings that would be ripped from him "ah dear child don't let what you don't see decieve you." I raised my wings and exstended them I heard Lucas choke on his food and Larry gasp in shock "keep fighting against them." I said and folded my wings as I watched Dr. Lacy come in to 'fetch' me for training. I finished my drink and stood up "rember keep fighting." I whispered and met Dr.Lacy at the door who offered a fake smile "come on now Chilly training time." I followed her out the door not bothering to glance back I already knew the two brothers where staring after me. Training was in a large room that had a giant red X in the middle of the room with a giant circle around it, several docters including Silk where standing on the circle with clip boards and pens I took my place in the middle of the X surounded by the scientist. "you know the drill." Dr. Silk snapped, I spread my wings and a few scientist came up to measure them. I waited patiently then they told every one else the measurments and the pens flew to the board, then I took a deep breath and flapped my wings I lifted up in the air  I was about twenty feet short of the ceiling when I started struggling, I tried lifting up higher, I went a exstra few feet "steady there!" I heard the shouts of scientist I tried to block out their shouts but to no avail, I felt my self fall I almost let out a scream but I caught myself ten feet above the scientist I started osing my balence I heard shouts from them but I went twirling down I tucked my wings in and landed hard on my shoulder and winced as I hit the hard floor. "get up and try again." Lacy demanded. Thats training for me. for the rest of the day I tried and continued to try flying. By dinner time I had knocked my arm out of its socket twice from the falls and I'm pretty sure I was bruised. I collected my dinner from Missy who had her long black hair up, I found my seat and started eating when I heard the doors open I looked up to see Lucas and Larry with a gaurd, the gaurd left them and they glanced at me but went to get dinner. I winced as I moved my sore shoulder so I could eat when I watched as Lucas and Larry sat across from me Larry gave me a look I knew and I felt my gut twist  Lucas glanced at me warily. I stood up and grabbed Larry's arms and pushed up the long sleeves red blotches where on his arms, anger filled me as I stared at them "they...s-said n-n-not to tell y-y-you." Larry stuttered as he pulled his arms away, I heard someone trip and glanced up to see Missy stand up and run for the doors, "who was it?" I asked my voice dangerously low "a l-l-lady w-w-w-with  r-r-r-red hair and b-b-b-blue eyes." I clinched my teeth "Dr. Lacy?" Larry nodded I stood up my chair flying across the floor I stomped to the doors just as several gaurds with their metal night sticks out all ready in fighting stance I spread my wings and grabbed the closest chair and threw it into the men then launched myself in to them. HOW dare them he was barly moe than ten. "PEPPER PUT THE MAN DOWN!!" I heard a well known voice I turned from holding a gaurd against the wall by his neck to see 'General' Frank holding Larry across the room in a head lock I locked eyes with Larry who was shaking in fear I met Frank's eyes and he glared at me "release Larry first." I said lowering the man slightly "Pepper do as I say." Frank said I raised a eyebrow "if that is what you wish." he was about to say yes but his eyes widened as I launched in the air with the man I was barly able to get ten feet with the extra weight but I dropped him and he let out a strangled cry as he fell I swooped down landing infront of Frank "How dare you evil people do that to him! He is barly a KID!" anger was burning hot through my veins as Frank shoved Larry aside And pulled out a shock gun out and pointed it at me "Pepper what have we told you about rebllion?" he asked "you bastard-" I could't finish because he had pulled the trigger I fell to the floor, I watched as a gaurd released Lucas who wrapped his brother in a hug hiding my body from Larry's sight. then slowly my vision went dark.
