"Love will not own me! No one will own me! I am a god!"
She laughed at my words and looked at me with a smile again. "Love owns whoever it wants and by what you are asking I think it owns you."
I looked at her and said nothing. Was I now owned by someone? Something? She interrupted my thoughts with her silky voice, "Who is it?"
"What?"
"Who do you love?"
"You." Her eyes widened and I knew she would tell me to leave at this point, but I didn't care I needed to know more about love. "How do yo-" Her lips pressed against mine and she stayed there for a moment. I was going to push her off, but I liked the feeling of her lips on mine. When she moved away she smile.
"What was that?"
"A kiss. People that are in love do that to each other."
"I like it." I kissed her and she moved to sit next to me. She put her hand on my back and pushed me closer to her. Once she pulled back I asked her yet another question, "Are people in love always so close?"
"Yes. You know you really do seem to know nothing about love. Why is that?"
"I am a god I have no need for love."
She laughed a little and gave me a short kiss. "You seem to be enjoying this."
"This is love?" Love owned me now and for some reason I was happy that he has taken ownership of me. I like this mortal or as she says I love this mortal.
"Have I taught you noting? Of course this is love."
