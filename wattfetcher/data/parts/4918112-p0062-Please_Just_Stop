Their argument was pretty extreme, so that's why I threw in a hypothetical I guess.
There was a point to making this, though. The point is that fanfiction can be a really really good thing... and it can be a really really bad thing as well. We never know what we're going to get, and that's part of our problem.
The other part of our problem is that people live out perverse fantasies through RPF half of the time... While I don't want to contradict myself, again, RPF concerns me. This sort of fanfiction, I feel, SHOULD be avoided... But at the same time, I don't want to tell people what to write.
Really, I wish there would stop being some sort of war between fanfiction writers and other writers. Especially the big fight that erupted after [insert fanfic title that is preposition/adverb] got published for real and was thrown in the market. The fights got the ugliest immediately after this.
We should be able to write what we want for the most part. So long as it's accurate or believable and doesn't romanticize stupid things [I'm looking at you, "Kidnapped By (the)(insert adoring pronoun here)" stories]
Just some food for thought.
Please don't kill me.
Up next, a rant about the new Wattpad interface. It sucks major ass. Stay tuned.
