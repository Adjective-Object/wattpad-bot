"When I got a divorce, I started to cut again. When I broke up with Amber, I started to cut more often. The last girl I was with didn't care about me or my life or anythjng except my money so I kept cutting. Then I met you and I started to do it less. When we were apart and I broke up with her, I started to do it more often again. Then we talked on the phone and texted a lot and I was able to stop. That's what I meant when I said that." Johnny said. Samantha put her arm around him. She leaned her head against his.
"Oh johnny. Why didn't you tell me sooner?" She asked. Johnny rubbed the back of his neck.
"Because I didn't want you to leave and think I was just trying to get your attention." He said. Samantha shook her head.
"I would never leave you. You know that." She said. Johnny smiled.
"I do now." He said. He pulled her into a passionate kiss and leaned back. Samantha was laying on top of him.
"Lazy day in the hotel?" She asked. Johnny nodded.
"Yep." He said and turned on the tv.
