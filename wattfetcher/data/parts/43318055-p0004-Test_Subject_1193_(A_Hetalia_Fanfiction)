"Come Â on girlie don't struggle that would make it hurt more"Brundle said."NONONONON it hurts no leave me alone"Riley screamed."Come on now girlie you want to be stronger than the normal human being then I sujest you stay still and take the damn needle"Brundle said."Noooo leave me alone"Riley said trying to break free of the bindings. Brundle stuck the needle in Riley and made her scream.

After the forms were signed Alfred ran to the room and picked Riley up bridle style, because the liquid in the needle that Brundle gave her made her not able to walk for 48 hours."Ok lets get you home and you can finally meet your uncles, and cousins"Alfred said.
