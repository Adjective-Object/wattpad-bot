Y/n's POVI was walking out of my work ready to head home to my parents. I got there around 5 I got out around 4 it took long. I unlock the door to see them both talking in the living room "Hey mom, dad? You okay?" I say very concerned "Y/n... I-We" my dad starts "We, we adopted you from a family..." of course I knew that "yah okay so..." "but what we didnt tell you, was you are a younger sister you have older twin brothers they dont know of you either... but we want you to see them!" I being flabbergasted jump up "What you kept this away for 22 years! 22 years! 22 years!" I kept repeating that number 22 "how old are they?!" I ask concerned "uhh.. we think 25?" "Oh my god! Oh my god! Mom dad how could you!" I ran up to my room I was upset 'why do they tell me now' was the only thought I had, I had streams of tears down my face '22 years' was the last thought before I passed out._______________________________________I had awoken around 6:37 I decided to get ready for my trip to LA. I lived in Cincinnati ohio that's where my biological parents live. I was to see them at 8 am. My flight was at 2 in the afternoon so I had time till then I packed my most important things and grabbed my flight pass I said goodbye to my adopting parents and left to my biological parents. Around 7, I got there they said my brothers were leaving to LA thats were I was to meet them but right now they were not home so I talked to my biological parents for 25 minutes, then I left for my trip. I got there around 7:35 lucky me! But not to lucky I bumped into a guy around the age stage of 20's "oh hey sorry didnt see you there!" He said helping me off the airport floor. I laugh "it's okay! I was waiting for something to happen like this, you know embarrasing?" He laughs "not a good day huh..." like he isnt having a good day either "Not really you?" He just laughs and grins "I just found out I have a sister ive never knew of!" "REALLY! I found out I had twin brothers I never knew of" he smiles "Are you y/n by any chance, a 22 year old?" I smile "are you mark or tom a 25 year old?" We both laugh "I am mark!" He says holding out his hand I laugh and shake his hand "tom is over there checking out souvenirs!" He says pointing to a tall man looking at knick knacks on a shelf, wow I have dorky brothers I guess found out i'm no different, we walk over to him. "Look who I founded tom!" Mark says very dorkely adding ed at the end of found "Hey I'm tom you are y/n, right?" He asks, I nod "okay just making sure mark didn't just bring a person over here!" He laughs as mark says "hey standing right here!?" Gesturing himself I laugh "well we have a flight to catch dont we lets go!" I say ecstatic to stay with two dorks like me for awhile.We aboard a cold plane. We sit down me by the window tom in the row front of me by a window and mark sat next to me! I was tired I kept getting up at night anxious to meet my real blood family, although I was raised only child I had bunches of friends who were like a brother and sister: violla was sweet always was she was a bit older by an age and deric was very sweet only 2 ages older. I passed out, figured I was cold because I had awoken with a blanket on me and me leaning on marks shoulder he was soo nice so, I am upset I never knew him when I was 10 worst stage of life for me...____time skip because I can____We had arrived at I am guessing marks abode, t'was nice. Tom got the guest room and I had to sleep in the same bed as mark not weird to me i've slept with deric and violla before (get ya mind outta the gutter) but wasnt sure about mark.... we got to know each other even more, they were both so sweet, But i was really really tired i shouldn't have took a nap in the plane i laugh to myself "Why are you laughing!" Mark asks... "Oh...Nothing. Just never shouldv'e tooken a nap in the plane i am so tired!" He laughs "well we will be back home soon!!" he says, we were out bowling "Hey you know what!" i look over to him "What?" "well maybe someday you'll meet a best friend of mine.... well actually more than one!" "Well..." i yawn "...that's awesome can't wait" "You can take a nap on my shoulder and once in awhile on tom's he wouldn't mind..." he smiled i smiled back and leaned my head on his shoulder "You are the brother i was missing out on huh?" i felt him slightly laugh "i love you y/n, you are awesome!" i then pass out
_________Half an Hour later_________
Tom awoken me "hey... it's time to leave! you ready?" i nod "Thanks for letting me nap guys..." i say while we were driving back to mark's place "You are welcome, what's big brothers for!" mark and tom both say. Once we got back we ate some food, pizza of course, and i passed out in mark's bed.
