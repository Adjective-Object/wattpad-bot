So that is a picture I took and cropped of eclipse and Edward and Bella are with Alice letting her plan the wedding because Bella has just made her decision.............
In that clip of a paragraph you see that it says August 13th and that just happens to be the day I was born!!
Now 13 is typically the most unlucky number but it is my lucky number!
My mom was born on February 13th.
February is the 2nd month of the year and August is the 8th so that's six months apart that means my mom and I were born one a bothers half-birthdays!!
AND MINE IS IN A BOOK!!!!!!!!!
How neat!
