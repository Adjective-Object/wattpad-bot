Sakura rushed to the window, just in time to see one of the castle towers burning to the ground.
"Hurry. The explosion was on the eastern wing." One of the guards exclaimed.
"We have to hurry the princess is in trouble!" The other exclaimed. The trio only looked at each other before racing to the sight of the explosion.  When they finally arrived, they saw the Princess alive and well with practically not a scratch or bruise.
"Princess-sama, are you alright?" The guard asked.
"Yes. I'm fine. I just hope that Sayo-nee and Gemi-nii are okay."
"Sis, are you okay?" Gemi asked,
"Where were you two?" Twilight asked.
"On the North side." Sayo answered.
"Why were you there?" Twilight asked, sensing something was off. The royal family isn't allowed to be in the Northern wing and that was a direct order from her for reasons best only known to her.
"Um, we had stuff to do." Gemi answered, rubbing the back of his head. Sayo kicked his shin.
"Like what?"  Twilight asked being very surprised at the answer. Usually, her siblings would tell her everything.
"It was important but more importantly is the fact that you're safe." Sayo answered hurriedly, smiling rather nervously.
"This doesn't seem right." Haruka noted to himself seeing the suspicious behaviour of the the younger ones.
"But Princess, you don't have a place to sleep." The guard mention.
"That okay." Aya started, "She can sleep with us."
For a while, Twilight was happy until she realized that he would be there.
"I'm not sleeping in the same room with that pervert." Twilight complained with a cute pout face.
"Well, that can be solved." Sakura answered with a smile.
"Good night!" the three girls sang already tucked in their beds. Remember there are only three beds in the room and there were four occupants.
"Why the..." Haruka started....
"HELL MUST I SLEEP ON THE FUCKING FLOOR!" Haruka yelled with only a pillow and cover.
"Because, you're a boy." Twilight answered.
"You move in your sleep and you sleep without a shirt." Aya continued.
"And we afraid for the Princess' sanity." Sakura ended.
"Then why don't she share a bed with one of  y'all!"
"Umm.....Nope." The girls sang.
"Y'all are so fucking mean."
"He's foul too."
"Haruka, that's two slaps tomorrow."
"What the hell?! I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY FUCKING SLAPS. I WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP IN A WARM ASS BED."
"Three..four..five." Aya counted on her hands with a smirk.
"That's a shit load of pain." Sakura noted with a smirk.
"That's one for you too." Aya mentioned with a poker face.
"Gomen ne, great Pink Fluffy Unicorn." Sakura apologized bowing her head on the bed.
Then Twilight started to laugh,"You guys are really funny."
"What's your name, Princess-sama?"
