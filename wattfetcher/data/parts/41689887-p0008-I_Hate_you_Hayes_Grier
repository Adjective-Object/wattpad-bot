I ran to the bathroom with my phone and my best friend. I began cutting my arm up to my shoulder and nearly sobbed. "Are you okay?" A girl asked around my age, "No way, you Keegan Dallas." she smiled, I smiled back a little, "Why are you crying?" She asked, "Hate comments." I said she nodded. "It's gonna be okay." she said and grabbed my wrist lightly, I flinched and she looked at me.
"Did you?" She asked I started to cry and nodded she hugged me tightly, "Look I did too don't worry." she said.
"What's your name?" I asked her, "Haley." Answered, "I hate Hayes Grier." I mumbled, "What?" She asked "Yeah I hate Hayes Grier." I whispered,"Oh why?" She asked, "Um..." I thought about his tour and didn't want to mess it up so I said I didn't want to talk about it.
"I gotta go my flight is leaving." I said she nodded and hugged me then I walked out and started to walk with them. "Keegan?" I hear my name, I look to find Hayes, "I don't think I should talk to you." I said We got on the private jet mom paid for me, yeah she's not home a lot because she works with the president well something close the the president.
I sat in my chair and Nash sat next me, Cameron sat with his whor* girlfriend, and Hayes sat with some girl he was holding hands with. "Hey look I'm sorry back there what happened I was just mad." he said, "Yep...I'm always the sl*t in the family." I said looking out my window. I leaned back in my seat and they played music and my seat was being kicked by Hayes's little girlfriend.
So I got up and found another seat away from everyone, I grabbed my my blanket from my bag and sat there listening to music slowly falling asleep.
Get ready Toronto, Canada here comes drama with the Dallas.
