I pulled Tessa closer to me.
"What ever it is Tessa can hear it as well." I said looking at my Dad.
"What's going on here?" Alpha Garretson asked.
"What do you have to tell me Dad?"
"Hey Dad. Have... Oh, I'll just be back then." Some guy said about to turn.
"No, Alexander stay here. Paul, I want you to meet Alexander, Alexander meet Paul."
"Hey." We both said at the same time.
"Why do I need to know him? Is he our new neighbor? New to the pack?" I asked Greg in a whisper since he was next to me.
"Paul, this is your half brother." Dad said softly.
I looked at him as I said the next sentence.
"Which side of the family?"
"My side of the family." He said.
I started to nod. I bit my lip. Then I asked him something else.
"Before or after Mom?"
"Before."
I put a forced smile on my face and nodded.
"Cool, cool. I'll talk about this later when Jaycie's back. I'm going to go on a fucking run."
My eyes were turning black then as I was not taking the news good at all. Tessa frowned and started to try and calm me as my dad said something.
"Don't use that language Paul." Dad said.
"You know I know that before you went with some one else that you had a mate."
"Paul, you don't know how I lived when I was young and a teen. I didn't know I was a werewolf at all like you did. Your mother had found me right when I was shifting at the age of 19. I had Alexander at 18."
I really didn't believe him.
"Paul your Dad's telling the truth. I was there for him in high school. His parents were scared to tell him. They thought he'd freak out." Alpha said.
I just nodded. I was still pissed though. Tessa saw it and tried to calm me down.
"Just wait until Jaycie hears this. She's going to react worst then me most likely." I said. "Come on Tessa. Lets get you and Chelsea to the police station. I think Chelsea would like to get her mate. Lets go. Greg, you want to come?"
"Yeah, I do." He said
"Then lets go."
"I can take you." Alex said.
"Do you have a car?"
"A car? I have more than one. Bought them myself. Anyone drive?" He asked with a grin.
"I can. I also know where it is." Greg said.
"Then you can take the Jeep."
"What are you driving?" Greg asked as he caught the keys to the jeep.
"My X-terra." He said with a grin.
Jaycie would be so jealous to hear that he has her dream car.
