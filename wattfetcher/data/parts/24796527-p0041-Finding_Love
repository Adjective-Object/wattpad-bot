"Short stack come over tomorrow night. Mom and dad would love to see you. We all miss you. I've missed you." He put his pointer finger under my chin and tilted my head up to look at him. "You may have lost your parents but you always have ours. No, they're not even just ours they consider you a daughter just as much as we consider you a sister. You're family." he kissed my forehead and hugged me.
"Thanks Dre Dre. I've missed you too." I pulled back. I got on my tippy toes and kissed his cheek. "I've missed you too Ry." I got on my tippy toes again and kissed his cheek too and then hugged him once more.
"I missed you too buttercup." Ry said and they both took off. I laughed when I saw Drew hit Ryan in the back of the head.
I gave spike a treat and walked home seeing that it was almost noon. Half an hour later I was cuddled up on the couch under a blanket with spike laying next to me. I didn't know what to do so I just laid there thinking of introducing Charlie to my two 'brothers'. He met savannah no problem, but these are over protective guys we're talking about here and a jealous over protective friend. God I hope dinner tomorrow goes well. Now I just have to tell Charlie but tonight, tonight I was visiting the rest of the family and we will all have fun. I pushed all thoughts aside and started petting spike. "I think you're the only boy who can fight over me and I wouldn't care." I said remembering the time spike jumped on and growled at Ty for sitting next to me. "I love you Spikey." I said in a baby voice and he barked. I took that as an 'I love you too.' and I just started laughing. I put the transformers on tv as I laid next to spike and pet him. About half way through the movie I took a cat nap, seeing that I didn't get enough sleep as it is and I was going out tonight.
