My name is Monica I'm 14 and pregnant I live in the ghettoes of New York and I hate it. I live in a tiny ass apartment and I hate it i have to take care of my little sister whose 9 years old while my rapist father does nothing he doesn't make any money only I do.
My mother is abandoned me as an infant I have no one but my sister Alissa but she's dying of cancer and doctors say she's only got a week left all she ever wanted was to see her mother and her sister be on top of the world making money the good way but here livin in the ghettoes on New York aint doin me shit.
I work every night selling my body selling crack just to pay for my sister medical bills you know when will my life start ? Never I'm a slave
Sometimes I just wanna put a gun to my head and pull the trigger or overdoes on crack but then when I'm about to pull the trigger or about to snort all that cocaine I remember what's gonna happen to Alissa huh who's gonna take care of her who's gonna tuck her in at night and make sure she's comfy at her death bed huh no one because if your dead no ones gonna care for her.
