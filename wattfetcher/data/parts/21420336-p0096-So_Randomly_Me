^^^me trying to explain how freaking pissed off I am
I'm not even gonna explain why cuz I'll get madderBut I've basically have had a horrible week
No not a "OMGS someone said they didn't like me I'm gonna kill myself" week
I mean a week that involved cops and court and shit that is just annoying
But enough of that I doubt anyone wants to hear my life story ;-;
So does anyone want a certain rant?
I'm gonna rant aboutttttttt
Freaking girls
Not all girls in general but mostly every girl I know -.-
1. All they talk about is boys BoysBoysBoys Like stfu I wanna talk about supernatural
2. They think they're better than everyone
I swear if I told you all the looks they give me XD They range from -.- To =.=
Both are  utterly terrifying
3. When they try to look cute and end up looking stupid
There is a difference between stupid and cute okay?
If your clumsy I find that cuteBut if you pretend to not know what 2+2 is that's just stupid
4. When they try to be cool
Omgs it's funny
"I can totally play soccer"
*trips**misses ball*
I can't play soccer and I ain't pretending I can for no one
5. They are so mean sometimes
Like if you hang out with boysThey will call u a slut
You hang out with girls you're a wannabe
You're smart you're a show off
XDAnyways I am probably guilty of at least two of these
I'll rant on boys next
XD
THAN FICTIONAL FEMALES THAN FICTIONAL MALES
