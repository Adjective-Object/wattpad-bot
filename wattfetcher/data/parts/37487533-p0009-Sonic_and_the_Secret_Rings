"When darkness descends upon the Arabian Nights - " Shahra suddenly said, "-the legendary blue hedgehog from another world shall come."
"Me?" I asked. "Legendary? You're kidding, right? Aw, you're gonna make me blush..." There was something strange about what she was saying.
"When the seven rings that control the world are gathered," she continued, "the world between the worlds shall open. But the life of the collector of the rings shall be offered up in sacrifice as the key for that control. That is what is written in the newest chapter of the Arabian Nights."
"Wait a minute," I replied, the shock of the word 'sacrifice' settling in. "I'm supposed to be a sacrifice?"
"That I cannot say for sure." Shahra explained, "But I do believe that these World Rings hold some sort of mystery to them. And I think we need to collect them all to get to the bottom of this mystery."
I looked at the ring with uncertainty, but saw the flame and thought about what the Erazor Djinn had said when I had first met him. I didn't know if I could give them to him. Who knew what power the rings actually held? "Well, considering I still have this arrow in my chest to worry about... I don't really have a choice either way, right?"
"I'm sorry." Shahra said quickly, "This is all my fault that this happened to you."
"Hey, don't worry about it." I told her, "Besides, don't you know how fast I am? Time may fly, but I'm still faster! Now, c'mon!"
I started to run, with Shahra following me outside of the ring. Hopefully, the king and the pterodactyl carrying him were nearby so the Erazor Djinn wouldn't win that battle.
