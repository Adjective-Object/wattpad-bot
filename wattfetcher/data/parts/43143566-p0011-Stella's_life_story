After the movie was over we headed home.i went strait up stares but didn't get very far with mother screaming after me,"KRIS!SHOWER!"I groaned a frustrated groan and headed upstairs like a lazy ass zombie and went to take a shower...It was NOT fun...Lets just sayI got soap in my eyes somehow..Ended up trying to get it out by-idiotically-rubbing my eyes...Went to grab my towel while my eyes were closed...Almost slipped and face planted into the floor...Opened my eye-painfully-JUST to find out that I grabbed no towel to begin with...
Towel: happy showerings *troll face*
