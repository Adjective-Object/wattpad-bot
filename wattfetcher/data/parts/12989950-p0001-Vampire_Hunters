Crystals Prov
I am crystal i am human i am sold to vampires like the rest of my kind.I have been sold to 2 people so far and this will be my 3rd i hope its a girl thier softer my last owner was a boy but lets just say it was bloody because the flashbacks will make me cry and i do not want to get wipped  I was so deep in thought that i hadn't noticed i had walked to a car and gottten in oh i hope its a girl but i will find out soon so i better keep my mouth shut a few minutes later we arrived and i kept my head down and tried not to bump into any thing gladly i didn't then i entered a room and a heard a voice i was afraid of
"Its late better get to bed you have a big day tommorow" Said a taeenage MALE voice
I hurried to a cozy looking corner near the heater but i fell and burnt myself on it I acted like it didn't happen got up and walked the rest of the way quietly sobbing because of the pain
