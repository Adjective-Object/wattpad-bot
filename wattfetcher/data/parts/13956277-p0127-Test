"Karam" He was reading some papers probably about our companies, "Yes?" He didn't look away from the papers, "I need to get back to my school or I'll lose the scholarship" I said, "So what? Lose it ! We got money, we'll put you in the best school here" He said, "No, I want to study in America, and my car is still there", "Don't worry about it, we'll bring your car in two days"He said and ignored me, I went to the kitchen and made some tea, "Here you go, now please concentrate" I gave him a mug of tea, "What?" He stared at me, "I want to study in America, I don't want to stay here, I hate it here, everybody hate me but you ! We got nothing to do here ! You can run the companies from America ! There's a company that produces clothes for is in there ! Let's both go ! Me and you ! We'll get a house and live together" I tried to convince him, he stayed silent for 3 minutes, thinking of what I said, "But what about Yara? The love of my life ?" He sighed, "Forget about her ! You'll find many prettier girls in America" I chuckled, "No, Leena, I'm not going to leave and let her down" I saw sadness and hope in his eyes, "Okay, fine. We'll go meet her parents, ask for her hand, she agrees and then the 3 of us leave to America, fine?" I said.
"But what if her father says NO?" I turned my brain on and thought for a minute, "I'Pl make him agree, if he doesn't, we'lol stay here, Deal?" I assured him, "Deal, but we need to take Muraad with us, we must have someone old" He wasn't very happy for needing to ask Muraad's help, "Fine, I'll try to keep calm when he comes. Now, call her and tell her to tell her father that we'll visit them after tomorrow".
"SIMON", "WHAT ! You blew up my eardrums" I giggled, "I'm coming back, find me a fancy house close to yours, me and Karam are coming" I smiled, "What? Why is he coming?" He seemed disturbed, "Because ! He's the only family I got ! And he's running my father's companies. I can't let him alone and leave. He's my everything" I sighed, "If Karam is your everything, what am I ?" He asked, "You're my other half... Now enough romance and start looking for a house for me, I'll be there in four days" I combed my hair with my fingers, "What about Karam? When is he coming?", "Not before a month from now, he needs a Visa and a ticket and to take care of the companies and stuff I don't know", "Yes, we're going to have fun. Me and you, alone, in your house, at night" He said, "turn your dirty imagination off"
