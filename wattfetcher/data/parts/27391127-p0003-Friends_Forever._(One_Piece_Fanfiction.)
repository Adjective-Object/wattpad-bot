"No, I'm rubber!
"What difference does it make baka!"
"Lots!"
Ace just stood there and laughed. "You're both bakas."
"What'd ya say?"
"Don't classify me with this idiot!" Sakura complained bonking Ace on his head.
"Why'd you that!"
" 'Cause you're both massive idiots!"
"Don't classify me with that idiot!"
"What'd y'all say?"
"Shut up!"

"Sove whicvh dorgm wre yoh hewded tee?" Luffy asked his face being badly beaten up.
"To the Skypiea dorm. No.356." Sakura hissed still upset from that argument with Luffy earlier.
"Oh, can I come too?" Luffy asked miraculously reviving himself.
"Like hell!"
"Aw, but I have friends there. I wanna see them."
"That's still a no." Sakura roared pulling Luffy's cheek.
"Hey Ace, can I come?"
"LISTEN FOR KAMI'S SAKE!" Sakura yelled.
"Yeah, you come."
"And don't accept his offer!" Sakura yelled bonking Ace.
"Damn, this girl is using some serious haki there. That's the third time."
"Plus, I need you to help protect Sa-chan." Ace joked. Sakura stopped in her path and her hair shadowed her eyes.
"Don' ever call me that." Sakura threatened.
"H-Hai." Ace and Luffy answered trembling.
"Let's go." Sakura answered very seriously. The air seemed to stiffened a bit and the boys were having difficulty breathing.
"Yeah, let's go."
"We don't want to upset Sakura again."
"That's great lets go!" Sakura answered, her mood changing completely and the air felt nice and cool.
"Is she bipolar or something?"
"Dunno."
"Let's go!"

"This is the Sea-Train. It will take you wherever you need to go in this country." Ace explained.
"So cool." Sakura exclaimed.
As they were on the train, Luffy noticed the funny bracelet that she has. It was glowing non-stop.
"Oi, Sakura, why is your bracelet glowing."
"Oh, Ace gave me this bracelet. He said it will glow if I'm getting closer to him.Â  I guess its glowing brighter now because he's right there."
"Yosh, then that means you're his girlfriend."
"What the hell made you draw that conclusion?"
"Well, Ace gave you a bracelet and he only gave me a piece of paper." Luffy answered with a cute pout face.
"Don't you want it!"
"Of course."
"Well then, we're here." Ace remarked calmly watching the two fight between themselves.
