(YOUR POV):
I walked into school, head held down, "Ready" for another day. God... It's not my fault... I thought as I walked past the staring kids, I can't control death! Who do they think I am, Hades? Osiris? GOD?
I let my hair cover my eyes to block my face further, I didn't need to see anyway, I knew the number of steps by heart. I'd been counting them down every day since her death...
I sighed in relief as I reached my classroom, safe haven. Thank whoever the door was unlocked, the less time spent in the hall the better. I stepped into the empty room, at least the teachers don't hate me... I thought as I waved to Mrs. Herna.
"Good morning, Proxis," she said as I went to my isolated seat in the back. I waved and smiled at her in response, I didn't talk much anymore, I'd basically gone mute since The Shunning.
I sat down at my desk, and couldn't help but glance around the room. Every desk other than mine was part of a group of four, all neatly arranged into little clusters. All of them didn't want me in their groups anyways.. I thought as I gathered my stuff around me. My little barrier, I thought as I finished the wall of binders and books. The wall cut me off from everyone else in the classroom, it blocked them from seing me and I, them. The only gap in it was for me to see the teacher, but it wasn't big enough to let them see me.
The morning bell rung, and I slouched down further in my seat. They're coming... Yup, sure enough, the morning crowd rushed in, chatting with friends, playing on their phones, normal people stuff.
The rush passed without anyone noticing me, they didn't usually single me out when a teacher was in the room. Thank someone for Mrs. Herna!
The late bell rung, signaling the beginning of class. Here we go...
