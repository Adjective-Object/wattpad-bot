If your wondering, "Hey, doesn't Lily hate James?"
Nope. The two got together last year. She got over her "breakup" with Sev and decided to give Potter a chance.
I'm happy for her but I'm not very fond of her boyfriend..I'm sure the feeling's mutual.
She's currently at Potter's house. She's gonna stay there for the rest of the summer holiday.
Mum and Dad are on holiday in Sweden as well, and Tuny..well she's with her Fianc√©. Vernon Dursley. I'm not very fond of him either, but she's happy with him.
I'm currently drawing in my sketchbook. If there's anything I'm proud of, its my drawing ability.
I've decided that I'm gonna draw something every week and add a bit of writing on the bottom of the paper. It'll be something I've been feeling.
I'm drawing an anime that represents myself but I don't know what I'm gonna do for the details yet.
I was just finished with drawing the outline when I heard the phone ringing from the family room.
I quickly skipped down the stairs and picked up the phone.
"Hello?"
"Yes, is this the Evans household?" A male voice came from the other end.
"Yes." I answered.
"May I speak to Miss Petunia Evans or Miss Liliana Evans?" The man asked.
"Um, they're not here at the moment. This is Chandelier Evans." I replied tentatively.
I have a bad feeling about this..
"Oh..alright then. Um, this is Dr. Eklund calling from the Marta Hospital of Swedan. There has been an...accident." Dr. Eklund said gravely.
OH HOLY CHEESEBALLS..my eyes widened.
Mum and Dad..accident...swedan..holy mother of cheeseballs.
"Accident? What do you mean doctor?" I asked hurriedly.
"I'm sorry to tell you the news this way.. but we found the bodies of your parents in an abandoned alleyway. It seems that they were brutally tortured..and are now dead."
