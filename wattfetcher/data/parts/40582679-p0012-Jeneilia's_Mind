My final exams are coming up OMG!!! I have to be studying for 14 subjects oh god!!! I swear this is gonna kill me If I fail I'm gonna have to repeat grade 8!!! That's like the worst thing ever all my friends would move on and I'd be stuck in grade 8 with some group of kids I don't know. If I fail I won't get what I want for my birthday my birthday is in August and its after report day like bruhhhh if I fail my bday is gonna be such a flop!!!! And I don't want that. Today we had our common tests for Arts and Science â€š Arts was sooooo easy our teacher made us use our book!! But Science was a little hard I forgot some of the science shit but there was so much!!! And he wanted me to remember all we did from last year September come straight back to this year June like dude what the hell do u think I am!!! . And then I had to finish my Menu card for home and family cause I forgot to make mine and so I had to be taking up all my maths time to do it cause we had home and family right after and we had a new teacher I don't know what the new teacher is like she probably wouldn't take it and give me a zero and I can't have a zero right now I cant go below 50% (that's the past mark for my school) if I go below then that's an academic probation a fancy way of saying bitch ur staying into grade 8 until u get smarter!! And I wouldn't like that as I said before. I think its unfair that a 13 year old have to be doing 14 different subjects!!!!!!!! And worst when we have an exam coming up for all OmG. Later guys I'm gonna go study until I fall asleep. I love you  ~Jeneilia X
