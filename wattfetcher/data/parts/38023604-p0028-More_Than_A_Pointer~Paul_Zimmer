"I don't need you to help make me feel better." I muttered.
"What's gotten into you?" (A/N: nothing... yet. OMG IM SORRY)
"Don't worry about it Paul! I don't want to bring my trouble into the household and make it yours!"
"Is this what that's all about? Because you think you bring trouble to me?"
"It's part of it. Yes." I mumbled.
"Goddammit Melanie! When are you going to realize that you haven't cause me any trouble? If you had, I wouldn't have put up with it! I would've left you before I got too attached!"
This was hardly making me feel better.
I brought my hands up to my face and shook my head.
"Seriously Melanie, what happened?" He asked softly. His whole demeanor had changed in seconds. From yelling at me to trying to make sure i was okay.
"I-I-" I stuttered and started to cry some more. Tears fell silently down my face.
"Melanie..." He cooed. "Please tell me. I need to know."
A/N: god writing this was so fuckin awkward because i only wrote it in english and math class. (my computer is still being a butt)
