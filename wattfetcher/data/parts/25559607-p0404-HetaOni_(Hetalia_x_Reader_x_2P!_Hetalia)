I found myself silent for a moment. "....I really...forgot everything...important to me?" I asked aloud, feeling a lump in my throat and starting to feel emptiness take over me.
"Don't...don't worry, I'm sure we'll find out a way for you to remember." Luciano reassured me.
My lips started to tremble, "But...what if...what if I don't remember?"
Caressing my cheek, Luciano made me look at him. "You will, (Second Name)..." he said, his eyes softening. For a few moments, we just looked at each other.
There was something about Luciano that always intrigued me. Though my memory only serves me from when I last woke up, when I "first" saw him, he felt so familiar. So familiar, it actually felt a bit painful. He was this cold, stubborn guy in front of his comrades, but...but he has this...other side of him that's actually gentle and even shy. I'm not sure which side of him was real, maybe it's both. To make things even more strange, whenever he looks at me...it feels like he's looking at someone...someone who's been away for such a long...long time.
Breaking the silence between us, Luciano cleared his throat and looked away. "Uh, by the way, ragazza..."
"Yeah?" I replied, tilting my head.
"You can get off me now." he quickly said.
It was then that I realised that because we fell down, we were actually lying on the floor-with me on top of the Italian. I completely forgot about that fact. Feeling my face heat up from embarrassment, I quickly got off of him and stood up. "S-Sorry."
He seemed like he was about to say something, when we both suddenly heard a faint clank. I looked down on the wooden floor and noticed that the metal object given to me by...Feliciano, fell from my pocket.
"Oops..." I said, kneeling down to pick it up. It was a metal keychain. At that, I began to remember my conversation with Feliciano earlier.

"I see. That's okay. Maybe you could help me remember some things later."
"Maybe. But for now, I think I have something that could help you recall something you've mentioned was important to you. I'm positive that this is yours, bella. I hope you'll remember us by this."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Luciano went beside me and looked at the object I held. "That's...That's yours, isn't it?" he said slowly. He then placed a hand on my shoulder and spoke, "Ragazza...this...this could be what we need! Do you...remember anything about this?"
"What? How could this small thing help me..." I said as I turned the keychain around, making me realise that I was looking at the back part of the object. In front, I saw that the keychain spelled, "Hetalia" in green, white and red.
As I read the word, a familiar song resurfaced in my mind.
Marukaite chikyuu...
Marukaite chikyuu...
Marukaite chikyuu...
Boku...
My eyes widened as I looked at the keychain and spoke, ".....Hetalia."
