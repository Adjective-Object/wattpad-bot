"Sorry but I was in Mr.Roberts' class, I needed to ask him some questions because as you know, I'm new and English ain't my main language, I'm so Sorry"
"A typical Arabian Muslim ...  late and unstuck" The teacher mocked and the whole class laughed while I froze in my place.
"Excuse me ? I think I didn't hear you well" I raised an eyebrow
"Go to your seat" He pointed at my seat.
"Well, sorry I won't, I guess you owe me an apology first" The whole class gasped.
"Detention after school" She said.
"As far as I know, detentions should have a reason like breaking some rules, and I guess I didn't break any" I answered confidently and the class gasped again.
"You did, by being rude and being late for class" She answered angrily.
"With all my respect Mrs.Peterson but number one : I got a permission from the principle to go and ask any teacher about anything anytime without getting in detention if I was late for class because of that, number two : Here's a paper from Mr.Roberts saying that I was at his class, Number three : you don't get to judge everybody for what a few of people do, So I'd like to refresh your memory by telling you that Muslims and Arabs has become teachers, doctors, engineers etc... and that we are all humans and we all make mistakes, so if some of us were not good that doesn't mean we're all bad, and please remember that between 10,000 student I won a scholarship that let me fly to here and that until now I always get A and A+ in every Test I take, which is quite excellent for an Arabian girl whose language isn't English. Now, may I go to my seat ?" I smiled.
The whole class clapped for me.
"SILENCE" The teacher shouted and everything went mute.
"So you're acting smarty and trying to embarrass me in front of my student, aren't you ?" She asked.
"No Mrs.Peterson, All I said was facts, I just corrected what you said, there's nothing wrong in learning something new, that's what you always say ... right Mrs.Peterson ?" I smiled widely at her.
"Open page number 57" She said.
I went to my freaking-disgusting-horrible-annoying-stupid-Seat beside Jake. Did I say that I hate him yet ? No ?
I hate him.
"Nobody has ever stood against Mrs.Peterson, I admire your courage" He whispered.
"Yeah, you really screwed her" Damon said, who sat in front of us.
And once again, the stupidest-people-on-earth's prize goes to ??? guess !!!
JAAAAKE AND DAMOOOON
"Leena, to the principle. NOW" Mrs.Peterson said.
These little stupid pieces of stupidness didn't notice the teacher behind them.
"I guess I got the right to stay in this class just like everyone else" I said.
"Just go, you're making it worse" Damon whispered to me.
"fine, but I'm sorry if you felt insulted by my words or if my tone was inappropriate, though I'm the one who got insulted" I really know how to turn the table, I saw her face softening but the angry look washed her face again.
I knocked on the door that had the word principle on it.
I wasn't scared, because I knew I didn't do anything wrong. You see ... When I'm wrong, I don't even argue, I just lower my head in shame. But when I'm not, I make sure to have all my rights and dignity back.
