So I finally got around to making the next book. Just so no one gets confused if they had read Jeff My Killer, this takes place after everything happened so don't be asking, "Why isn't Jay in it?" Cause, I think you know the answer. Also, I will be doing the changing POV, so it will be changing between Carter and Jack's POV every chapter or so.
So, I'll start the first chapter soon and I'll try to keep a schedule of updating at least once or twice a week.
So thats about it! Hope you enjoy the new story!
