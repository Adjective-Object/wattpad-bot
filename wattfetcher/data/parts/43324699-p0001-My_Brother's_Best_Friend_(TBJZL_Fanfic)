"Come on Lauren please?" My brother Josh begs. "Josh, I've said no so many times. And how am I even gonna pay for my ticket?" I sigh. "I'll pay!" "No! I'm not letting you use all that money on me." "Well I'm allowing myself. Come on Lozzie please? The boys won't stop bugging me!" I thought for a moment."FINE!" He started cheering as I rolled my eyes. "YOUR COMING TO LONDON!"
Oh right let me explain myself. I'm Lauren Zerker, yes Zerkaa's little sister. I'm not that young tho. He's 22, I'm 20. Ya. I live in America with my mum, and our Lil bro Mike. He's 9. I have red pink hair not black even tho Mike and Josh both have black hair. No one knows where I get the red hair from but oh well. Oh ya, Josh isn't the only one who does Youtube, I also do YouTube, it's LilLozGames. I have 1 million subs. But anyway this is how I fell in love with My Brother's Best Friend.
I got this idea from TamiiiJ17 so the credit goes to her cause I love her story, so go check it out and enjoy.
