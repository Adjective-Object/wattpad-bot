Maybe death is just another home once you're done doing whatever you need to do here and like you don't get the key until you finish your checklist. Perhaps that's why I haven't died at every suicide attempt. Because I'm not done here. I have things I need to do, people I need to meet, maybe I'll even save someone's life. That could be why I'm not dead. Because I'm meant to do something greater.
But who knows. I could be wrong.
