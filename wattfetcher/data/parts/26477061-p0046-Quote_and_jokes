1- Don't go in there. Just don't! Ok?
2-Kill all children they are most likely devil spawn. It's better to be safe and kill all of them then risk one of them being satanic...
3- When music starts playing when you are walking, stop what you are doing and run back where you came from!
4- Don't scream. This won't help you at all, it's just really unsettling.
5-Keep your back to a wall so nothing can jump out behind you (unless something can go through walls)
6- Stop breathing heavily. It's annoying, if you can't breathe get an inhaler.
7- Use your head! Don't go in to a graveyard at night, don't go into the basement, and don't go angering weird monster/ghost things!
8-  Don't use ouija boards or anything like that. Please? They aren't original or scary.
9- If you fall over stand up. Don't crawl. Don't lay down and have a nap while it's chasing you! Just get up and run.
10- Make sure you're not in one of the crappy sequels to horror movies *cough*Final destination*cough*
