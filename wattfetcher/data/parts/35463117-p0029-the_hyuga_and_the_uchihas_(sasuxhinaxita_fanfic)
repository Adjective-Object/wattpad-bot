Tears of happiness filled narutos ocean eyes.
"Naruto, I'll protect you, forever and always. I'll be your shield. Because you are my life, and I will protect that life." Sasuke said before connecting their lips once more. The kiss dancing like a candles flame. There arms wrapping around each other like vines, and their hearts melting, like the senses of one biting into the sweetest, juiciest or fruits.

But now sasuke was clouded with a rage that only an uchiha can possess. He charged after naruto, who simply took the punch. Flying into a wall he spat out blood. He blocked sasukes kick and punched his stomach.
"I'll be your shield..." Sasukes voice rang in narutos head as he gained another 2 kicks in the side and a hard punch to the face. "I'll protect you, forever and always..."
Naruto was distracted and got flung into another wall. Then another, and another. Until naruto fell to the ground.
"Stupid naruto. Always getting in the way!" Sasuke said.
Hinata finally found her voice, "sasuke stop! He doesn't deserve this! He doesn't have to get hurt! Please stop hurting him!" She yelled hugging him again. She held him tightly as naruto tried getting up.
"Nothing will make you hurt, I promise you that." Sasukes voice echoed like a thousand shuriken in narutos chest. Rain started falling and sasuke left with hinata. Leaving naruto, crying. Remembering the things sasuke had said.
Sad flashback:'(
Sasuke approached naruto, he looked so saddened that naruto was worried. He ran over to his raven and held his shoulders.
"I'm so sorry..." Sasuke said. "I.......we....can't be together any more..."
Naruto took a step back, the one person, the one person he ever cared about, who cared back was leaving him. "Why??" The blonde asked.
