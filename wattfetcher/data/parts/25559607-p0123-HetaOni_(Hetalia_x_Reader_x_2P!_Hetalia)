The First Players headed to the second floor in search of Italy and _______. Â When they were down to the second-to-the-last door, which was the fireplace room, they heard a commotion from the room opposite of them. So, they entered that room instead...only to find an inhumanely large monster that was about thrice as large as the usual creatures they fought in the mansion.


"Eeek!" Romano shrieked, upon seeing the vile being.


Prussia cautiously entered the room. "What the hell?!"


"Hah... Hah...!" They heard someone pant, the monster was blocking their view...but they had an idea of who that person was.


"Italy...?" Japan uttered slowly.


Germany's eyes widened as he heard this and thus, he shouted, "Italy!!"


The monster disappears, upon being defeated by the Northern Italian coughing out blood.


"Hehe... You found me." he gave a weak chuckle, "Oh..."


Italy collapses, all bloody and bruised.


"Italy!!" Germany loudly called out as he rushed to catch the injured Italian.


Italy gave a shaky breath and looked around him. "It's... you, Germany


...Romano, too, even though I told you not to..."


"Wh-why? Why didn't you run?! Don't be stupid!! You should have waved your white flag like you always do!!!" Romano clutched onto his brother, tears springing from his eyes.


Italy did his best to nod. "Waving that... wouldn't have saved everyone. That's why I decided to do all I could..."


"Italy! Can you move?! Just take slow breaths!" Prussia told him frantically.


"There's still time! I'll stop the bleeding now, so bring me some bandages!!"


"Just stop it!! Why do you always have do things alone?! Take a look around you!!


Shit--When you wake up, I'm going to fucking kill you!!" Romano shouted, both in an angered and worried manner, the tears still running down his cheeks. He has never seen his own brother act like this before. It hurt him. It hurt him knowing his brother was in deep pain...and that he couldn't do a thing about it at that moment.
