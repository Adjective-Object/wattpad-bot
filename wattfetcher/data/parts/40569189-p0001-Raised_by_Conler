Armana's P.O.V
Yep, you read the title right. I'm Tyler Oakley and Connor Franta's daughter. And yes, I know, my parents are gay. But I don't mind. I never really cared that is, untilschool. But, that's not where we are starting. When I was about 2 weeks old, (I think) my parents knew I was a mistake, and they couldn't handle a baby girl. Therefore, I was put for adoption. Although, I have an interesting backstory. My mom was on bedrest and she knew my name was Armana, but she didn't know how, if that even makes sense. You know Armana is not a popular name, yeah my mom didn't want me named after that. She thought of thousands of ways to spell it, and my dad came in and yelled "A-R-M-A-N-A" as a joke, and she loved it.
