I'm kind of fed up. Idk. I have no reason to be. I just am. I'm falling back into being pissed off at the world for no good reason. And maybe that means the awake is ending. Thank god if it is. I can't wait to be back to me. I want to be me. But I want to be me before this. Before the awake. Before I was raped. Before I stopped telling my parents things. Before I had to figure out I was a boy. Before I lost people. Before I got lost. Before I learned how to stay silent. Before I went mute for a while. Before I realized I was bisexual. Before I met the people who changed my life. Before the suicide attempts. Before the self harm. Before the depression. Before the OCD. Before the ADHD.Before the PTSD.Before the BPD.Before all of the stupid mental illnesses. Before I ruined myself. Before I ruined Alexis. I was Alexis. I was normal. I was happy. I was the daughter my mother wanted. I was wanted. I ruined my happy family. And I'm sorry. I am so fucking sorry. But sorry doesn't fix what I have done. Death doesn't fix what I have done. Nothing will fix it. Restarts don't exist. My life is this way for a reason. I deserve the cards I was dealt and now I have to finish the hand. And maybe this is a losing battle. But I've got nothing else to do.
