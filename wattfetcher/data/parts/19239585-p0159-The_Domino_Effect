Brad came up behind her, trapping her between himself and the ledge by caging her in with his burly arms. "And that's exactly why you need to talk to them. You can't run from it forever. You may try, but in the end you'll end up doing it anyways. Better to get it over with now and save yourself years and years of grief and hate, right?"
"And how do you know that those specific feelings will go away?"
"Because I went through it, just like you." Lea widened her eyes, turning around to face Brad, who still kept her caged in like the poop-slinging gorilla she was. Brad sighed, removing a hand from the ledge and rubbing it across his buzz-cut. "That's another story for another day, so don't ask. I don't feel like crying in front of all these people."
Lea found it hard to imagine that this guy in front of her, made of pure muscle, had the ability to cry. She believed it though. Some may have found it hard to imagine herself crying after witnessing her threatening actions, after hearing her insulting remarks. But they don't know me. They never will, they'll never know me like James knew me. Or how Brad knows me now.
Lea looked Brad straight in the eye, speaking all truth. Let's be Jade for once. Let's have that foreign virtue, called determination. The ocean breeze cooled her face, drying her tears, as if encouraging her next words. "After the boat docks, I'll wait exactly one day before finding the person and telling them to meet up with me. Which means in roughly . . . three days. In three days I'll get the load I've been carrying and building up, and I'll drop it, breaking it. I'm going to apologize."
