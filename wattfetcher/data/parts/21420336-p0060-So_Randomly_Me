School
1) it is made with the sole purpose of making your life hell
I don't even need an example for thisJust two wordsHomeworkPeople
2) those idiot bullies/ plain mean people
Yup we all know someWe've all been teasedSome more than others:Kid: *grabs my pouch and lifts it up in the air* come on catch it!Me: *glares and jumps* *curses* give it back Kid: nah
You know what to do when this happens? Grab their phones and throw it yelling"COME ON CATCH IT!"
(I am not in charge of any suspensions or detentions XD)
3) those sassy teachersMe: Can I go to the bathroom?Teacher: can you?Me: yes I can. *walks out to bathroom*
4) not knowing any pjo/HoO fans
This one is just sadBut one of my teachers likes it so Point 1 for me!
5) popular girls who have too much time On their hands
Girl: oh my gods she looked at me dirty ugh she's such a peasant Me: last time I checked, you're considered a peasant also since all of us are lower middle class thus you have no right to speak of your classmates this way because donkeys shouldn't be bragging about ears
Agh now I have to go to school :( bye
