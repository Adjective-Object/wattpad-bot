"Who is it?" I asked.
"You" Colin told me. Me, I'm his crush, how could I not realize? I mean I sort of had feelings for him but I never wanted to ruin our friendship so I never did anything about it.
"Me? I had a crush on you too, but I didn't want to ruin our friendship" I told him.
"Me too" Colin told me and before I knew it we were kissing. I heard cheers from the others back at the table and I could just see Uncle Steve's face. A mix between shock and I'm going to scare the crap out this boy. When we pulled apart we were both smiling like idiots.
"I think we can make long distance work" I said and we both started walking back to the table. We sat down and I was holding Colin's hand and smiling like an idiot.
"I think someone owes me ten bucks" Kono said to Chin.
"I'm letting you know that if you hurt Kylie, I'm trained to hurt you" Uncle Steve said and Colin looked scared.
"Don't worry you'll have to get through Kylie first" Danny said, and we all back to laughing and eating.
