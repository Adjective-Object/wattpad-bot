"Hello?" I said as I carefully shut the door behind me.
As I pushed the handle on my large, pink suitcase down and set my backpack on the floor, someone came jogging through the room towards the stairs on the right.
"Hey," he looked at me. "Wait...who are you?"
"I'm Maddie. I'm from-."
"Cool." He ran up the stairs and that was that.
"Hello?" I called again.
I didn't want to stand here all day so I followed the guy up the stairs.
I opened the door at the top of the stairs and walked into a hallway with about four doors.
I opened the first one but there was nobody in there. When I opened the second one, there were two guys in there. One of which was the rude one from downstairs.
"Hey!" I shouted.
"What?" he said.
"That was rude; what happened downstairs."
"What happened downstairs?" The second guy asked.
"Well he asked me who I was and so I told him but he totally cut me off."
"Yeah he does stuff that. Get used to it."
I crossed my arms over my chest and scowled at them.
"I'm going to find some nice people who can actually help me."
I turned around and walked out of the room.
"Wait," one of the guys called back.
"What?" It was doofus number two.
"Have fun."
"Oh shut up."
I purposely slammed the door behind me and went back downstairs.
There was nobody downstairs still, so I walked past the two staircases.
I walked towards the right into a giant lounge type room.
Thankfully, there were people.
Three guys and a girl were sitting in a circle on the floor laughing.
"Can I help you?" One of the guys asked.
"Yeah. I'm Maddie. The new girl."
"A newbie. This will be fun," the girl said.
"Stop, April. Um hi. I'm Derek, this is April, that's Jake, and that one's Parker."
"Finally, now I know some names."
He got up off the floor and stood a few feet away. "Have you got in your room or anything?"
"Um no. I've been looking for someone for what seems like forever."
"Well let's go find Trey or Cindy. Follow me."
I followed. "Who's that?"
"The house dad and mom."
"Oh good, real people."
"Am I not a real person?"
We walked up the girl's staircase.
"No, you are. It's just that I need someone who can actually help me."
"I'm helping you right now."
He knocked on one of the two doors and opened it.
"Cindy?"
