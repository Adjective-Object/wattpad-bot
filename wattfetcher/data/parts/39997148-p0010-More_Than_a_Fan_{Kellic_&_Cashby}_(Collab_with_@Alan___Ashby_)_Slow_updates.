Vic's POV


"Vic the party starts soon." Mike said walking into the back lounge, "You're going right?
I sighed, "I don't really know if I'm in the partying mood."
"Well that sucks because you're coming anyway."
I glared at my little brother, "No. And you can't make me."
"I can and I will so get up and get ready we leave in fifteen minutes."
I stood up and stretched, "You're mean. Have I ever told you that?"
"Plenty of times." He said and walked off.
"Plenty of times." I mimicked and pulled on my shoes running my fingers through my hair a few times. In all honesty I really didn't want to go party, I didn't want to do anything really. Â I walked out to the guys and saw they were all playing video games.
"I thought we had a party to go to?" I said looking at Tony who pushed Jaime off the couch.
"I won!" He shouted jumping up.
"Ow!" Jaime whined rubbing his head, "Did you have to push me?"
"Yes and I fucking won!"
"Well good for you but you didn't have to push me." He grumbled standing up and looked at me, "Well look who finally came out of hiding."
I glared at him, "Don't."
"Don't what? I didn't do anything!" He said sitting back down on the couch.
"Just lets fucking leave."
"Jeez Vic, who pissed in your cheerios this morning?" He asked standing back up.
I rolled my eyes, "Not in the mood."
I didn't want to even go to this stupid party and I definitely didn't want to deal with anyone talking to me either.
"Don't be all angry. Parties are fun! Let loose Vic this will be fun." Mike said.
"I don't wanna have fun." I muttered crossing my arms.
"Come on you can go sit in a corner and drink away your sorrows." Tony said as Mike started to push me out the door.
"I'll gladly do that." I muttered, "Where are we even going?"
"Of Mice's bus, they got the good stuff there." Mike said smiling.
"Of course they did."
"Tino brought it."
"Yeah and you know Tino gets the good shit!"
"Yes he does." I mumbled as we headed to Of Mice's bus.
"Vic I swear to god I will beat the shit out of you if you don't cheer up." Jaime threatened.
"Fine, fine!" I said plaster a big, fake grin on my face, "Happy now!?"
Tony sighed, "Better than nothing."
"Whatever let's just go get drunk." I said rolling my eyes and dropped the fake smile.
"Let's." Mike said opening their bus door.
"Hey Pierce is finally here!" Phil cheered as soon as we walked in. We waved at them all. Music was already going and the bands - PVRIS and Slaves- were already here. As well as Alan who was busy taking pictures of everyone while Austin was talking to him but it looked like he was pretty much ignoring him the whole time.
