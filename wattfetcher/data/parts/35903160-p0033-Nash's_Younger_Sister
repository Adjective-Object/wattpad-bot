Today I woke up feeling horrible.I had a sore throat,stuffy nose,and felt like I was going to vomit.Wait I am going to vomit.I run straight to the bathroom and start throwing up."Mia you look horrible,"Shawn says."I feel horrible too,"I say."Cameron go get Nash or Hayes and tell them to come here,"he said while gagging.Cam got Nash."Wheres Mia at?"Nash asks.He then runs to the bathroom."Cam go in her bag and get her medicine,"Nash said.Cam gets it and gives it to me.I go to my bed and take a long nap.

Sorry its so short I am so sick right now.Next week I'll probably feel better.
