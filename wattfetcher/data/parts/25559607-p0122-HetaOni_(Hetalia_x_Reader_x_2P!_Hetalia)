I dared not move, but I listened intently. After a few moments, I heard a clacking noise from outside. It seems to be the door to the bathroom beside where I was.


"I told you, it's Nikolai."


"Hmm, you seriously going to use what that girl said?"


"It's better than being referred to by the same name as that lonely wimp."


"Ah. I see what you mean. Alright, Nikolai. Hahh.. What was my name, again? Za...Zao. Right... Zao. Not bad, re--mpfff"


Before he was able to finish his sentence, it seems as though the other guy stopped him.


After a few moments of silence, I heard Nikolai whisper.


"Shh. Looks like they're already out of the basement and are on the way to the second floor."


"Aiyah... Those damn bastards search pretty fast. Let's head upstairs cautiously."


"Da......hmm?"


"What is it?"


"The First Players are already upstairs....but strange...I feel like we're not the only ones left on this floor."


"Is that French drunkard slacking his ass off sleeping again?"


"No. No... Different..."


At that, I noticed the knob in front of me was turning.


Panic and fear was instilled in me as my heart pounded and my eyes widened while the knob was being turned from the other side ever so slowly.


Then, the door was opened.


"Heh."


I froze.
