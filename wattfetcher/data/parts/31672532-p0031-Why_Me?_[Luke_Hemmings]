"Luke please tell me you don't do this, any of this?" He can't, he just can't be like, like me.
"Alex can I be blunt? If I tell you this you cannot tell anyone else, deal?"
"Deal." Luke sat next me on his bed and looked me dead in the eyes and took a deep breath before speaking.
"I have bulimia. I am diagnosed but mum doen't know and my doctors think she knows. I go to my doctors without her so she won't figure it out. I was chubby when I was younger so when I was 12 I heard about these kind of things and tried it and then it became a habit. I tried stopping but it doesnt work sometimes, but I havent done it in a week so far." I had no idea on how to respond and how to process this all. Luke doesn't even look like the kind of person to do that, any of this. But then again, neither do I. Most people that look happy and healthy are probably breaking inside and wanting to die like me, like Luke.
"I am so sorry Luke. I never would have guessed-"
"Stop, don't say sorry for my mistake. Please be honest about this Alex, I just told you that only 3 other people know and never told anyone else"
"Okay, but please do not tell any one else, promise?" I cant believe I'm doing this.
"I promise." here goes nothing.
"I-I have severe anxiety."
