"Now get, some sleep, we will be heading off early tomorrow," he said and I nodded then he went out and closed the door behind him.
I've never been to the city before, so I don't know how things over there work. The only technology I have is a phone, which is getting old.
Once I had a shower and got changed into my night clothes, I got into bed and drifted of to sleep.
************
Before you knew it tomorrow came.
After I had a shower I got changed into some black skinny jeans, black sleeveless crop top, red checkered shirt with the sleeves rolled up and my black vans. I decided to leave my hair down in nice waves and I've never had make up so I never wear it.
When I was done, I jogged out of the house and went to meet Keith at the truck.
I got into the car beside Keith and before he started the engine he handed me a piece of paper.
"This is Ashton Prince and behind that is the school address, so there shouldn't be any problem finding him or the school," he told me and I nodded.
I looked at the picture and I think my heart skipped a beat because from what I saw in the picture the boy looked hot. I mean I've never seen any guys before except for Keith, but just by looking at the picture he has to be one of the popular jocks.
Then Keith handed me another picture.
"This is Ken, just in case you kill the wrong person."
I rolled my eyes and took it out of his hand.
After, Keith handed me an envelope.
"This is all the money I'm giving you, so spend it on what ever you like but once the money is gone then that's it your not getting anymore, and there should be about 1267 dollars in there."
I opened the envelope and saw that it was full of money, well I better keep this safe.

The car journey was about 3 an a half hours but we we're finally here.
I got out of the car, and looked at the building. It was a little cottage with flowers running up the walls.
Keith knocked on the door and we waited a couple of minutes till the door finally swung open revealing an old lady. She looked like she was in her late 60's.
"You must be Keith, how nice to see you," she said shaking Keith's hand, "and this must be Sky, who's coming to stay here," she asked and Kieth nodded, "please come in."
"Oh no that's alright, I'm just hear to drop Sky of, but I hope all of this isn't a trouble for you..." he stop, "sorry I never catch your name.
"Oh how rude of me, my names Mary," she replied.
"Well Mary, I have to be some where at the moment, but please look after Sky for me," he said then turned to face me, "Sky be good for Mary, and remember what I told you."
When Keith got in his truck and drove out of sight, I stood there awkwardly.
"Please come in Sky," she said so I grabbed my suitcase and followed her in the house.
This is a lot to get used to.
