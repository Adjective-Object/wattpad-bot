Prologue
'freak, weirdo, dumb, nerd' was what was on Andy's mind all day.
Kicking, punching and things were what they did to 6 year Andy.
Andy always came home with a collection of bruises and cuts everyday, his parents were hardly home because of their job and his sister was off partying anx getting drunk so Andy was left to tend to himself.
Everday after class, kids would corner him in the toilets and beat him up, and call him names.
Andy drifted away from everyone, he had no one. He had become moody.
He was alone.
