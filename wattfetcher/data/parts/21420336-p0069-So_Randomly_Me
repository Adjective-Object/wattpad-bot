I'm shocked, I can't believe they're ...Sad that I ain't there ...They miss me...Man what a horrible mistake I made ...And i can't take it back ...It's way to late ...If only I could relive my life ...I'd re-make this song ...Rewrite the hook and it would be like ...Life shit,but I'm taking matters to my own hands.I can picture myself as a grown man.I wanna grow up, and I can deal with change,Even if everything gets rearranged.Maybe my life's a disaster ...and time keeps going by faster ...But now I can see all that shit don't matter ...Fuck that Imma live my life!"
-Kyle Spratt- "Suicide Note"
