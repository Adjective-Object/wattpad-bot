By the time we got back to the track Chase had cooled down after our make out session. He also brushed off my whole stopping in the middle of the make out session, for now. "Hey, I know the perfect spot to watch the fireworks!" Chase took my hand in his after we got out of his car and go a blanket out and laid it on the grass. He had parked in the furthest area from the track but still on the Dover Downs campus, and it actually was a secluded area. So we watched the fireworks while laying on our backs and they played music along with the fireworks show. Mostly country music and one of my favorites that was sort-of country came on; Sparks Fly by Taylor Swift. "This should be our song." Chase said as he planted a kiss on my head. "Why?" I was laying next to him so I turned my head and we were face to face practically nose to nose.  "Because I see sparks fly when ever you smile." He sad smiling at me. I gave him a sweet kiss, "You're just the sweetest you know that?" I couldn't stop smiling.
