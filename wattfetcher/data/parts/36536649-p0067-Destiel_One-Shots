As the doors opened, she saw something she never thought she'd ever see in a million years.
There was two of the people from her rebound list.
Dean and Castiel.
Making out.
Passionately.
Like, Cas' hands in Dean's hair, Dean's hands on Cas' belt buckle.
Jo cleared her throat and tapped Dean's shoulder.
His eyes shot open and he broke away from Castiel instantly.
"Uh, you know, that's not very professional, making out in an elevator when you should be working," Jo said.
"Whaaaaat?" Cas asks.
"We weren't making out," Dean said, voice raising in pitch.
"Oh, excuse me, about to have mind-blowing sex in an elevator when you should be working," Jo corrected.
It was quite awkward after that, both of the boys blushing up a storm.
"You know what, I'll catch the next one," Jo began. "And boys?" she asked.
"Yeah?" they asked in unison.
"Next time, maybe try one of your offices?" she suggested.
As the elevator doors closed, the last thing Jo saw from Cas was an open mouth, and the last thing she heard from Dean was, "That clever bitch."
Jo pushed the button again, mentally crossing Dean and Cas off of the Rebound List, laughing to herself.
Maybe this won't be a bad day after all.
