Your beautiful. He whispered.

My eyes flew open in a flash.

You are the only person who has told me that.

I am so sorry I hurt you. I have done more damage to you then I ever wanted. Yet you always forgive me. You are my angel. You frighten my demons away. But I cant save you from them.

I don't need you to. Your  my soldier, but you don't always have to be strong.

I wish I could have protected you from all of this. I wish I could promise you that you would never be hurt again. But I cant. I am just not strong enough. Every time I touch you, I am afraid I will hurt you.

Bucky. Oh my precious Bucky. You don't have to always be strong.

I gently ran my hand against his face. He held it to his face. He then dropped it and went back to patching up my cut shoulder.
