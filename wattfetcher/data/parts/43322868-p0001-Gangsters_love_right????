Makayla pov ( point of view)
Today I decided to go to the mall not to shop but to go with my cousin kaitlyn and my best friends Nyla and Kayla I went into the bathroom did my hygiene things and looked in the mirror I remembered what  Micheal did to me I don't know why I stay I never told anyone about him I covered my bruises with makeup and dressed in a blue long sleeve shirt and skinny jeans I grabbed my purse and my phone and left while Michael wasn't there
**at the mall **
Kaitlyn: where should we go next
Kayla: food court I didn't eat breakfast
Makayla: me either
Nyla: yea I'm hungry
Kaitlyn: Kay lets go
We ordered our food from subway then sat down and ate out the corner of my eye I could see a group  of boys starting at us I hate when people start
Kaitlyn: look at those guys starting at us Makayla look at the one with the Afro starting at you Makayla you should go talk
Makayla: one I have Michael two I don't want to
