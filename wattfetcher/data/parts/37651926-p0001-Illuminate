A bird whom first sets forth in flight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        is one to die in night

ILLUMINATED GLASS STARED AHEAD. The flickering so intense. A soft feeling of fatigue engulfed my body in flames and wrenched me to the floor. Squeaky boards caught me, tangled me with despair.

This was a normal routine.

They say the future will bring new things- new thoughts and views. But that does not exactly apply to me; I was sealed into a lie. That's no secret. Even after the democratic distillation of the people, no one soul was sent to fetch me, leaving me, along with the nightmares that arose in this overly-decayed dwelling.

What was I to do? I was confined with various restraints that harshly constricted me into the hoary, green wall- the remnants of the physique of a fortress. Songs of passionate birds filled my ears to the profound depth. A reminder of the definite future I was to behold in my grasp. The inequality of it all was excessive and merely...terrifying. Was it my fault I was born like this? My doing? I was permanently a burden; even my biological parents did not want me, their daughter, their own flesh and blood. Had they situated into remaining good parents, I would not have been left alone in the woods as a newborn.

I would not have been regarded with the devious expression gifted to multiple neglected children. Hate. The opposite of love. It is said, so I have perceived, that no individual is capable of feeling hatred towards others. If such words are true, is the world even capable of feeling love? Are we capable of loving? Am I capable? The solitude was what affected me the most, other than the absence of valid nourishment and water. So without contradictive reasons, grieving was the only reasonable fixation I was actually certified to do without punishment. But that was a week or so ago when my imprisoners were still seizing my agonized self.

My only wish for what followed was death. Sweet death was what I craved every second since the torture began- since my screams could still be heard. I had tried so relentlessly to kill the misery along with my burden soul. The tattered truth held up the strong verity that taunted me, nearly in a similar manner of saying "I can leave! You cannot!"  That was what amputated the unseen noose free from my frail, porcelain neck.

The collision pounded.
