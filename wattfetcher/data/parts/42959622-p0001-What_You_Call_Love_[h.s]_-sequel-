"So, Taylor how's the food?" Harry says sarcastically since I've been devouring it . "It's good." I say with my mouth more full then I excepted. I grab a napkin and bring it up to my lips and dap the spaghetti sauce away.
"I'll be right back Taylor." I give him a nod as he gets up from his seat to go to the bathroom. I take another bite of my food. Damn it's good. I pull my phone out of my pookabook to text Amy who's was baby siting Ema for me.
Me: hey Amy how's my little stinkah doing?
I lay my phone on the table as I take a sip of water to refresh get the food down. My attention gets pulled from my what I was doing when I hear Harry's voice.
Far away.
"can I get everyone's attention please?" My head snaps to the direction where Harrys was coming from. He was on stage.
What was he doing on stage?
"I'm so sorry I interrupted everyone's dinner but I really wanted someone too know how serious I am." He moved his hand swiftly through his brown curls. Every time he does that I get shivers sent through my body.
"um can I Taylor Keith please come on stage." My heart speed increases and my breathing gets heavier. I was never one who liked to be the spotlight of a big crowd.
I nod my head no too Harry.
"Oh please Taylor. I really need you too." He pleaded to me. I slowly stood up from my seat and looked down as my heels clicked on the ground as I walked to the stage.
Why would he do this to me?
He takes my hand as I walk into stage to make sure I don't trip or fall. Damn, that would be so embarrassing. "What the hell are you doing Harry!?" I whisper at him.
"Just watch baby." He takes my right hand into his as he hold the mic in the other.
"Taylor Keith, you are my world, my love, my mom, my sister, my best friend, my life line. Basically my everything. You've been with me since day one and I'll never forget that. Words can't explain the love I have for you because it's indescribable. I remember when we were in the shower other one day when we were sixteen." My cheeks grew red as he mentioned that.
"And I gave you a promise ring. I told you that one day I was going to replace the small diamond ring with a bigger one better one. But this time it's not going to be a promise ring." My palms were sweating a lot as my heart was beating 10x the original speed.
"today's that day." He took his hand from mine and shuffled around in his pocket. Once he had it he got down on one knee.
"So Infront of all these people, cameras, paparazzi, I want to take your hand in marriage..." He opened the small blue ring box to show a big beautiful diamond ring. My hands quickly went over my lips and they quivered. My eyes got watery just as the thought of being able to be called Taylor Styles.
"Taylor Keith. Would you do me a huge honor and become my w....."
"Wake up Taylor." I feel my weak body being roughly moved side to side in attempt to wake me. But I didn't budge.
"Wake up now Taylor!" The voice said too me louder. My eyes open just a tiny bit so I was able to see who this person was.
Christiana.
"No." I pleaded to her as she shook my weak body to wake once again.
"Yes! You've been in bed for basically two whole weeks since Harry took Ema." Just hearing those two names made my heart feel as if it was being stabbed a million times.
