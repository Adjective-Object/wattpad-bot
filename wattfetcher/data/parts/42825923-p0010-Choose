"Jack,can I talk to you real quick?" I asked,standing up from my seat.
"Why?" He asked,raising and eyebrow at me.
"Um..I have a question about,um,puberty." I lied.
"Ok?" Jack responded getting up from his seat and walking over to the bathroom with me following behind.
I pushed Jack inside and closed the door behind us.
"Bro what the f-"
"I think I like Alex." I said,cutting him off.
"What makes you think that?" Jack asked.
"I don't know.Shes different." I replied,tugging and the roots of my hair.
"Oh,well I um.....I-"
"What?" I asked,cutting him off.
"I think I have feelings for Mayra.But I don't know,I mean we just met them."
"You're right.You're right.Yeah we should get to know them a bit more." I said.
"Okay let's get back to them."
-Alexandra's P.O.V
School today was normal.The day was quiet.One more period until we can leave.
Eight.
Mayra and I walked into class and sat in our usual seats in front of the boys.
"Hey." Matt whispered into my ear as I sat down.
"Hi." I replied with a smile.
The rest of the class was talking except for me because it's that time of the month and I don't like to talk much when I'm on my period.
"Alex,you okay?" Nash asked,noticing my lack of communication.
I nod in response.
"You sure?"
"I'm fine!" I snapped,causing everyone to turn their gaze towards me."sorry I didn't mean to."
"It's okay." Nash said,sitting back in his seat.
"No I'm sorry it's just that time of the month and I didn't mean to-"
"Its okay,i get it." Nash said with a smile.
I nodded and continued to listen to his conversation with his friends.
The bell rang signaling schools over.
"You guys want to come to my house?" Matt asked everyone. (Nash,cameron,hayes,jack,jack,mayra, Shawn.)
"Sure." everyone replied.

We reached Matts house and went up to his room.
"So who wants to play a game?" Matt asked,sitting on the floor.
"What game?" Shawn asked with a raised eyebrow.
"Truth or dare."
"I do." I said,sitting down next to Matt.
"The dirty way." Matt continued.
