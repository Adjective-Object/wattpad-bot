Aya: Fukusū (meaning multiple)

That one arrow multiplied into many and Haruka barely had the time to notice it and dodge.

Doflamingo saw them, however but blocked them wit his Haki. After the storm of arrows ceased. the entire ground around him was glittery and one unfortunate soldier who was caught in the storm, was glittery and paralyzed.

Such was the power of Aya's devil fruit.

Going back to Haruka and Doflamingo.

Haruka was getting tired from fighting him. You could see it from the way his chest moved up and down.

"You shitty bastard. What did you expect? You're fighting fucking Doflamingo for crying out loud not Ussop!" His conscience spoke. (the devil)

"You have a point but peaceful negotiations would've been better."

"Shut the fuck up!" Haruka screamed.
"Who are you talking too?"
"No one in particular." Haruka answered blushing from embarrassment.

Then Haruka passed his hand through  his hair. "I wonder how far Aya has gotten?" Haruka wondered looking up at the sky.

If it was not for his good hearing, he wouldn't have heard Doflamingo sending string behind him. He quickly dodged it and pointed his slightly sparking katana at Doflamingo.

For each string, Haruka sliced it that was well before, Doflamingo strategically sliced his katanas.

"Damn."

Haruka was ready to raise his hands for an attack when he realized that he couldn't move.

One would hardly believe but Haruka somehow found himself caught in a web made by Doflamingo's strings.

"Got you, Lightning Demon." Doflamingo smirked before using Overheat.

At that moment, blue flames burned the strings and Haruka barely missed the attack.

"You're not supposed to hurt the students-yoi."

Haruka looked up at the figure with fear. He knew something was up and now the they found out."

"Oh, I didn't know you were here, Marco." Doflamingo siad. Ignoring him, Marco turned around to face Haruka.

"You're in trouble too."
