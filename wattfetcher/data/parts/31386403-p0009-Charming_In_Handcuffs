On my way back around the house, I spotted Jack’s light on in his room.
Then I thought about sleeping in Lindy’s car.
It would only be a few hours, right? And I’ve talked to Marie before. Actually, several times. I’ve helped her garden once. That was thrilling.
My legs decided for me and I was walking over to their house. My heart was beating so fast I thought I would fall over. Better do it before I chicken out and sleep in a car. I raised my hand several times and finally forced myself to knock lightly. I know Jack’s awake because it was nearly 2 in the morning. I don’t think I’ve seen him sleep before 2.
The door opened and Jack stood on the other end.
Desperation, I reminded myself.

Sooooo, Jack will be in the next chapter. I hope this is a good start to the story, if not, I'm sorry, lol. But I hope you like it!  Votes and comments are def appreciated in more ways than one! :)
PS. There won't be a love triangle, just throwing that out there hahaha. And hopefully I'll have a cast for Juliet in the next chapter.
