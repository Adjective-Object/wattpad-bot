"Scarlett" Luke says not looking to happy. "Yeah, sweetie what's wrong?" I say all sympathetic knowing that something is wrong. "I think... I think it might be time that we go our separate ways and before you interrupt me know that I love you and that won't change. You are the only girl I've ever loved and we've been going out for three and a half years and I just think that we should be Luke and... Scarlett and not Luke and Scarlett." I hold back the tears, stand up, kiss Luke on the cheek and I walk away." As I'm trying to get my keys out I walk right into "Kai, sorry I wasn't looking where I was going, I just need to get out of here." I can't stop it anymore the tears just come running down my face. "Hey, come here." He says placing my head on his chest. "What happened S?" S that what Kai has always called ever since we were like three or four. "Luke broke-up with me. Why would he do that I mean I thought we were good? You know? I just don't get it Kai." "I don't know but he's an idiot for letting a girl like you go." "Thanks Kai, I really needed to hear that especially from a guy." "Let me drive you home, I mean I am the jerks best friend." I nod, reach into my bag and hand Kai my car keys. We get to my house and Kai turns off the engine and says "I'm really sorry S, I wish there was something that I could do to help you." I raise my eyebrows, grin and say "maybe there is something that you can do to help." He looks at me because he knows the look on my face. He knows I have a plan to get back at Luke.
