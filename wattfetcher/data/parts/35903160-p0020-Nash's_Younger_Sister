Ok so today I went to Jump Street.There was this really cute guy.I didn't ask his name.But I got hit 17 times in the face by a dodgeball.Then a hair flip saved my face.Once it was my friend Kevin and the cute guy against me.I was scared but hair flips saved me and I won by pegging both 'em.Cute guy got hit in the face and his eye was RED but he was still really cute.I will always remember him.I gave him the name of 'cute guy'.My friend said I should have got his number.NO NO!!!!!!He only hit me once cause I accidentally hit him.I almost cried when I hit him.This dude will be my 4th death1st -Shawn Mendes 2nd-Handwritten3rd-JJ4th-Really cute dude at Jump Street
