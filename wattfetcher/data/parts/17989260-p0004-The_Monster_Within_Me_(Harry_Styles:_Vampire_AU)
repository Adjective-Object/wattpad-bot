TRISHA'S POV.
Today is the day of revenge. I decided to go with my evil plan so that Harry will become so jealous that's it's gonna hard for him to let me go.
I decided to act like a slut today so I decided to wear a v-neck sleeveless top and a plue skinny shorts that reaches the middle of my thigh. I wore heels since i think that it will be perfect with my look. I did my make up naturally since I hate make up and it gives me rashes.
As soon as I opened the door, all eyes were on me. I even saw Harry and Stephanie staring at me like they just saw a ghost.
I just mentally laughed and smirked at their reactions.
I walked towards my locker and a lot of people are still staring at me. I was fixing my books and my notebooks when someone hugged me from my back. I turned around and saw that it was Harry.
"Hey Babe." Harry smiled. This is like the first time he called me babe eversince he started having an affair with Stephanie.
Speaking of Stephanie, she was still there, looking at me wide eyed. Ha! Eat your heart out you bitch.
"What do you want?" I asked him removing his hands on my waist and turned around to look at him while crossing my arms on my chest.
"Nothing, I just wanna see my beautiful girlfriend." Harry smiled. Lies, lies!
"Okay whatever." I snapped Â then walked away towards my first class.
"Okay, I'll see you later babe!" He shouted and went away to the opposite direction.
I just rolled my eyes because I know that he's being a sweetheart just because I looked like this.
I was about to enter the classroom when I heard someone whistle behind me. I turned around and saw the group of the popular boys in our school.
"Hey there sexy!" Niall, the blonde hotie, said. "Hey there hot boy." I smiled, trying to act like a slut. "Care to join us to lunch?" Zayn, the brown eyed sexy boy, asked me. "Of course." I smiled biting my lip. "I'll see you later babe." Louis, the blue eyed hottie, winked. I nodded and went inside the classroom.

I searched some articles the other day. I searched on how to turn a human into a vampire. I found out that when you make a human a vampire when you release your venom to the human or, make the human drink your blood. I smirked evily and decided to choose the first option, since I'm starting to get thirsty.
And the first person in my transform list is.......

Niall James Horan.
