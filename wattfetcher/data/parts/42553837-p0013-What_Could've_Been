You chuckled, rolling your eyes. "I won't regret it one bit." You said it in a joking matter. My fingers started curling up, my veins growing tighter by the second, then it soon turned into a tight fist with my hand shaking. I glared at the two of you, my eyes saying what I am currently feeling.
Feeling the huge tension, both of you slowly turned to look at me. Before you can say anything, I punched Adam's cheek harshly; I turned to you, punching your stomach instead. "Can't you be perverted somewhere else, you god damn bastards?!" I exclaimed.
You clutched your stomach tightly, Adam falling to the floor. I frowned, clenching my jaw. I have been taught proper manners in that six years, but one thing they'll never change-my anger issues.
"What the fuck, Taylor?" Adam whined, rubbing his left cheek. I ignored him, just stared at my hand. I know that you were looking at me. I couldn't bring myself to look into your disappointed eyes-my one weakness.
You stood up straighter, proving that you're taller than me now. "Nothing good ever comes with violence." You scolded. I stayed silent, just forgetting about what I did. I tuned you out, just calmly walking away from the kitchen.
I felt nothing as I passed the leather couch and TV; nothing as I opened the door of your house. I walked outside, ignoring the noise behind me. It reminded me of what happened with us as kids. You would eventually forgive me but I'd still feel guilty. Because this time-I injurabout what I did. I tuned you out, just calmly walking away from the kitchen.
