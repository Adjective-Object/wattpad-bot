"Goodbye kiddos, I'll see you afterschool. Don't get in trouble, love you both" her mom said as she slowly got out of their luxurious car. Her twin brother was already slamming the door shut without giving a response to either one of them, running over to his group of friends in embarrassment.
"Bye Mom, I love you too," she muttered, gently closing the door.
As the small girl watched her mom drive away she let out a sigh. She started to walk up to the gates of their middle school. Downing the hallways she could already hear the not so whispers of boys and girls making fun of her affection towards her mom, how she dressed, or even how she walked. "What was so bad about skinny jeans and a plain blue shirt with the words "EPIC" on it?" she thought. She never knew why it had to be like this, she hadn't done anything wrong to any of these people.
As she entered her first class, a few girls from the dance team tripped her, causing all her notes and supplies to scatter everywhere. They took advantage of the teacher coming late. The girls swayed to their seats smirking at the mainly attractive boys. Most of the class was laughing and others were just feeling sorry. She hated the attention. She hated the sympathy. Picking up everything she had she wondered again, did it have to be like this? Didn't anyone see what people did to her and just wanted be her true friend?
But throughout everything, she had never noticed the boy who would suddenly stand up from his seat in worry, almost going to her every time she'd get hurt in any form.
