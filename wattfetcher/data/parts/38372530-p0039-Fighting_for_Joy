"Devin you know I can't." I said.
"How you just gonna drop the role play babe? It's Apple cider." He laughed
"Oh. Sorry." I giggled and he kissed my back.
"It's cool. Sorry I didn't come up and help with the kids. I was trying to get everybody gone." He said and I giggled.
"It's fine babe. They weren't much trouble." I told him and he kissed my neck saying good.
I turned around feeling him on my back. "In the tub?" I asked him and he laughed.
"Hell yes." He told me and grabbed a condom. I looked at him confused.
"What are you doing?" I asked him.
"Getting a condom. Come on." He said and kissed on my neck.
"Why do we need that baby?" I asked him.
"What you mean? No more babies remember?" He said and I stopped him.
"When did we agree to that?" I asked him and he stopped.
"What? Agree to what babe?" He asked.
"No more babies. I never said I didn't want any more." I said.
"So you want more kids right now?" He asked.
"Well not necessarily." I said thinking about Devin being older.
"Okay then." He said and continued to put on the condom.
"Baby you're talking about forever. Like never having another child." I said putting my hand on his chest and he sighed.
"Baby-" he started
"Do you want more kids yes or no?" I asked him.
He sighed not saying anything. I hated that. He didn't like to tell me what his plans were. When we talked about children he said all I'm asking for is my little boy. Then I won't ask for anymore leaving the option open to have more children.
I got out o the jacuzzi style bathtub and went to the shower no longer in the mood for sex or even relaxing. After I took my shower, I found Devin in bed. He must have used the one down the hall.
I laid down in bed my back facing him.
"Devin when were you gonna tell me that you didn't want to have anymore kids?" I asked him.
A/N
Okay, so you all did surprisingly really bad on the guessing game! The answers were Texas and Lawyer, Judge, or governor for her father and Business owner or restaurant owner for her mother. Remember when her and Devin met Erin and Kelsey up they went to her mothers restaurant and it was like a poetry night?
45 comments. I gave lots to talk about.
