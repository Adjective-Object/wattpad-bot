~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Ready?"
Your heart was pounding in your chest.
"Set..."
You heard the door close.
"Go..."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You quickly ripped off the blindfold and threw it on the floor. It was dark. But your eyes adjusted to the darkness. There were rows shelves filled with un used notebooks, extra papers, pencils, pens, and other school supplies.
You ran towards the shelves and pushed you way through some old boxes. You turned your head around and scanned if there was any other place you could hide. There were closets and cabinets.

You ran up and down the rows of shelves, and book cases. You pushed some boxes aside and moved tables. While you were looking for a hiding spot, you were also looking for an exit. Maybe you could escape... If you were lucky to fine a way out.

You stopped to catch your breath. Every once in while you spun your head around because you thought you heard something. The walls felt like they were closing in on you. It felt harder to breathe.

"Ow!!!" You cursed quietly when you accidentally smacked your face on a shelf that you couldn't see. You rubbed your face and sighed.

'I'm never going to find a way out. Maybe I should just go hide. By the way, if he can't find me, he has to let me go'
You made your way to the darkest part of the room and his quietly among the shelves of books. Cold sweat dripped down your neck. You silently prayed that he wouldn't find you... You closed your eyes
5... 4... 3… 2… 1…
Blue orbs with little specks of pink greeted yours when you opened your eyes. Strawberry blonde hair was dangling. Freckles were splattered on his pale face and he had a smile on. Oliver found you.
"'Ello, poppet..." Oliver said in low seductive voice.
"H-how, how did y-you find me that fast?" You stuttered "i-its nearly impossible to do that!"
Oliver just chuckled and clicked his tongue.
"Dearie, (F/n), love. Its easy to find something that fast if it belongs to me..." He smiled. "Oh, and that means, I won... And you lost. So, you're staying with me." Oliver whispered the last part in your ear which made you shiver.
'No, I can't! I just can't!'
You opened your mouth to say something, but Oliver silenced you by pressing his lips on yours. You gasped due to shock and he took advantage of that and slid his tongue in your mouth. It tasted like sweet frosting. You slowly fell into the kiss but quickly pulled out.
