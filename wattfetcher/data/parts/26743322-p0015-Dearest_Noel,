dearest noel,
today was a bit stranger than normal, noel.
do you remember christopher newman from 8th grade?
well we both know what he's called 'the psychopath'.
he is back at school today after supposedly being dropped from juvie.
everyone was running away, staying within their groups, avoiding physical contact or eye contact with him whatsoever.
a girl even peed her pants when he shot her a glare.
i don't get it. everyone is so scared of him.
i'm way too tired to even flinch if he stares at me.
just like he did in the cafeteria.
i was walking away from the bin and he was sitting on a table all by himself. his brown hair a messy mop on his head as the hair strands shot in different directions and his blue eyes were so cold and yet mysterious.
he shot his head up and his eyes landed on me. and so did my eyes and i didn't bother reacting. i just held the gaze until i walked out the door.
he doesn't scare me one bit.
he is more of a mystery to me.
it's funny because everyone labels him as this monster. but aren't we all monsters hidden behind a facade of smiles and laughter.
aren't we?
monsters aren't under our beds.
monsters live inside of us.
just like this monster lives inside of me.
killing me slowly every second with regret.
dammit noel, i fucking miss you so much.
