You are the sky, Full of stars, clouds, home to the sun and the moon. I am the sea, Dark and cold but still beautiful. We must admire each other from afar, For our time to touch has not yet come But I will wait here For the day the sky meets the waves. And when they do, Your star sprinkled lips Will meet my sea salt ones. Your fingertips will feel like magic. You chased the ghosts of my past away, You've helped me accept that I am the deep, dark, ocean blue but that's okay. There's a galaxy between us, Open for exploration, So let's dance through the stars of distance, love. - (m.m)
