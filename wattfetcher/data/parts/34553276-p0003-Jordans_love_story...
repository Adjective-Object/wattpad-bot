I looked down to see a huge burn mark in my side. Wow I was shot and didn't even feel it.
I looked back up at everyone to see worried faces.
I shoved my shirt down and got up. As soon as I was up I sprinted to hannah. I shoved orange out of the way and stood in front of her protectively.
"Stay back." I threatened. I soon felt really weak and fell to my knees.
"JORDAN" Hannah screamed. I could feel me falling back. The last thing I saw was all of them run to my side.
Before my head hit the ground, red slid under me, my head in his lap.
I looked up into those lime green eyes one last time to see worry and fright. That was what I saw till blackness over took me...
