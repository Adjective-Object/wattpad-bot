OMFG. That's all I can say right now. It's been a week since the first day of school and I have pretty much the same classes as last year. Luckily I have a class with Jay and I have a few classes with Melissa and Sara. Ok so one day right after school ended I went to soccer practice which is at our schools turf field. I grabbed a ball and started warming up with my friend Addie from my team. I kicked the ball to her but she just stopped and stared at something. I followed her gaze and I noticed Jay was sitting in the bleachers watching me practice. "Omg May, Jay is totally checking you out." Addie said as she confirmed my suspicions. To show off I went over to the net and started taking shots. I have to admit the shots I took were awesome. After a while Jay came down and started taking shots with me. We were laughing and chasing each other around. It was so much fun! When it was time for me to go the sun had started setting and my parents were wondering where I was. I said good bye then got on my bike and started heading home. I was about 10 feet away when I heard Jay call my name. "May wait!" I turned around and got off my bike. By this time everyone had gone home and the sunset left a pink/orange glow behind us. As soon as Jay caught up to me he leaned in and kissed me. Omg it was perfect. When our kissed ended Jay said softly "goodnight" then he walked away. I got on my bike and started heading home. I could still feel his kiss on my lips as I sped home.
