Hey everyone! I just wanted you to know that I'm going to be publishing the epilogue tonight or tomorrow sometime! I really appreciated the people who stuck with me and I'm sorry for the long wait! IF YOU HAVE READ THE STORY BEFORE I RECOMEND YOU RE-READ IT AS I PUBLISH BECAUSE THE STORY WILL BE CHANGING.

The video is celebrating  Marriage Equality , I think its something good. others feel differently but I feel you should be able to love who you love and not be judged and cast down by people around you.
