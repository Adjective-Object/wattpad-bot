Alan stopped walking and grabbed my arm, "Okay, I'm done with this." He said looking annoyed, "Why is it so awkward between us?"
"I don't know."
"Is it this morning? Did I say something weird or?"
"No you didn't say anything weird." I grumbled.
"Then what is it?"
I sighed and ran a hand through my hair, "I don't know I think I'm just still pissed about what happened between Jaxin and me."
"Then why does that make us awkward. I mean that shouldn't affect our friendship." He said, "That's completely different from us."
"It didn't affect our friendship, it just put me in a weird mood and I don't know Alan. I don't know why it's so awkward between us!"
"Okay, I understand it then."
"What?"
"I mean it makes sense. You're just in a mood from the Jaxin thing."
"Yeah that's totally it." I lied.
"And it explains why you've been acting like a crybaby all day too."
"Sure."
"Is that not it?" He asked, "Is there something that I'm missing?"
"Nope not at all. That's it." I said, "Now come on we need to get back to the buses before I miss soundcheck."
"You're lying."
I rolled my eyes, "No I'm not."
"Yeah you are. What's going on with you? Or me? Is it really the Jaxin thing Austin? I don't want things being awk-"
I kissed him. He needed to shut up and this was all I could do. Alan stiffened and put his hands on my chest but he didn't push away this time.  He kissed me back and grabbed my shirt pulling me a little closer. I smiled against his lips before finally pulling away.
"Why did you do that?" He asked quietly still close to me.
I shrugged, "You wanted to know why things were being so awkward."
"So you kissed me?" He asked, "What does kissing me have to do with anything?"
"Well I just-." I sighed, "I don't know how to explain it."
"We should go. We're gonna be late."
"Yeah let's go." I said softly.
He nodded.
The rest of the walk to the bus was silent and just as awkward as it was before much to my disdain.   Once we got back we went straight into the venue knowing we were already late.
When we got in everyone in the band glared at me.
"What did I do now?" I asked as Alan and I got closer to them.
"Well first off you're late, second what is this?" Aaron demanded and showed me a picture on his phone.
"Who took this?" I asked looking down at the picture of Alan and I kissing.
"Some fan." He said and took the phone away from me, "What did we tell you about staying away?"
"Staying away?" Alan asked, "What?"
"Don't worry about it." I told him and looked up at the guys, "Look I'm sorry but well it was awkward and I couldn't help myself!"
"No what are they talking about Austin."
