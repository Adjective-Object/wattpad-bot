Italy shifted nervously. "...... Yeah."
England clicked his tongue. "But I also have different memories. I remember coming with America and Japan, and it was China who got separated from us, not France."
Italy suddenly piped up. "Maybe we're getting confused because there are several mixed memories? We don't know which one is right... and it makes us draw the wrong conclusions."
Russia cupped his chin and thought for a while. "Ah, that's also an idea... When false memories get mixed in to hide the truth, we get confused and don't know what is what. And once you suspect something..."
To my horror, he suddenly locked eyes with me before continuing his statement,
"...everything else becomes suspicious."
Like, whoa there, Russia. Why am I the suspicious person here? I mean...okay he's got a reason...but Italy's hiding something here, too...and---OH. You'll be suspicious later, too. So don't be like dat man. I avoided his gaze and stared at the floor instead.
"Well, then, that means that from now on,whenever we break a clock, we'll get a lot of false memories, but we shouldn't believe any of them!" Italy told us.
Japan agreed. "If we invite confusion... Right, I think we must discard those fake memories without believing them."
China rolled his eyes. "What a bother. Also, we have to be ready to get strange memories while we break the clocks."
"Right. If you can discard them without worrying about them, you should definitely do so." Germany said.
They all nodded.
"Anyway, I'm going to break this clock. If you get any strange memories, just forget about them right away.
Don't forget whom you came with or how you came to be here now." Germany instructed us.
England let out a sigh and looked at his watch. "Y-yeah, if we don't break it, time won't go back to normal. We have to break it as soon as possible."
Italy nodded cheerfully. "Ve~ Right."
I looked at him in disbelief before proceeding to stare at the ground while clenching my fists.
They're being fed with lies.
