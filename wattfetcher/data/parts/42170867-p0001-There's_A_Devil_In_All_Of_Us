I walk to my mothers room. Seeing her on the ground....crying. I hated seeing her in pain. She must've heard me walk in. She turned around and got up fast. "Sage, honey what's wrong?" She asked wiping her tears. "Mom, what's going on?" I ask.
"Nothing Sage, I'm fine. You should just go please." She said as my father walks back in with a giant smirk on his face. "Dad? What's going on?" I ask
"Oh nothing sweetheart. Just talking to your mother." He said giving my mom a stern look. "Leave Sage." My mother says. I walk out the door.
Then after I walk out I heard a loud crash on the door. I couldn't help but cry. Was my dad hurting my mother? I was so scared.
"Rick stop!" I heard my mom scream. I ran in the room and then my dad turns to me. "Sage get the f*ck out!" He screams at me. "No! Your hurting mom!" I yell. He throws my mom on the ground and comes up to me.
I then feel his hand slap right across my face. I was shocked. I felt tears coming through. "Rick! What are you doing?!" My mom screams at my dad.
I got up and ran out of the room. I ran into my room. I started sobbing. I then heard a knock on my door. It was my brother, Karver.
"Oh my god! Sage, what's wrong?" He says running to my bed. He sat next to me. "Dad..." I say sobbing more. "What did he do?" He asks. I put my head up to show Karver my mark on my face.
"Oh my god..Sage...d-did dad hit you?" Karver asks. I cry more and nod. Karver got up. He was so shocked. I got up and gave Karver a bear hug. "I'm so sorry Karver." I said crying.
"No Sage, don't be sorry. It's not your fault." He says. "Karver.." I say. "Yes?" He responds. "Dad...H-h-he has been...hurting m-mom.." I stutter out. Karver looked at me serious. "What?" He asks.
"Dad has been abusing mom..." I say crying. "Oh my god.." He said. "It's gonna be ok Sage. I promise we will figure this out.." Karver said. I hugged him tighter... What if not...
------------------------------------*4 Months Later*
*Bing Bing Bing* My alarm started ticking. I sat in my bed..motionless. It's been 4 months since it all started. My dad has been abusing all of us...more and more. (Sage has 1 twin sister, Nora & 3 brothers. Karver is her oldest brother and Kol is her youngest brother & Trip is her brother who is like the middle child) I hadn't really been able to sleep. But today I had to go to school. Rather if I want to go or not. I had no choice. My mom was too afraid to leave my dad. I would've been the same way tho. I got up and got ready. I put on black ripped skinny jeans and put a sweatshirt on that said "I'd Rather Be Sleeping". Then I grabbed my black converse and put them on. I straightened my long black hair. I put on some eye shadow and some lipgloss. Then I put make-up that would cover my recent bruise from my father. Except now I don't call him "dad" or "father". I call him Rick. And he seems ok with it. He may hate it, but I could care less. He says he would never hurt us but yet he still abuses us. And there was really nothing we could do. I grabbed all of my stuff and ran downstairs. I saw my siblings were all ready and we were all eating breakfast. Since Karver was the only one with a driver's license, we had to go with Karver. I could tell all of us were trying to avoid Rick. I see a bruise on my moms cheekbone. I walk over to her and hug her and give her a kiss on her head. "I love you mom." I mumble to her. "I love you too Sage. My beautiful little girl..in senior year." She says to me. I smile at her. My hand was in her hand. As I walk away I feel her hand slide away from mine. Me and my siblings all walked out and got into Karver's car. I didn't really want to go to school. I mean the only thing I missed was my best friends. Harper, Robyn, Willow, Kendall, and Alaric. (All of the friends are girls but Alaric) Karver then parked in a spot and got out. I kind of felt nervous. I was scared. I mean I was in senior year for 2 months before we stop going for 4 months after the..."incident". We all got out and walked into the school. I walk to my locker. The same locker that I still hated. I then heard some familiar voices scream my name. I turn around and see all of my best friends. They all ran up to me and gave me the biggest hug. "We've missed you so much!" Kendall says. "I have missed you all so much too!" I say. I really did miss all of them. I smiled and then when they all separated away from me, I saw an unfamiliar face. He must be new since I have been gone. He had blonde bar, a lip ring and very blue ocean eyes. He was gorgeous. I lost my thoughts as the blonde boy stared at me and smiles and walked away. "Who is that?" I whisper to Willow. "Oh that blondie? That's Luke, Luke Hemmings. He transferred here like 2 months ago.He's actually one of Alaric's friends." She says. "Oh..wow." I say chuckling. The bell rang and we went to first period. I saw Nora, who looked kinda sad. I got her attention and mouthed "I love you". She loved "I love you too" I smiled and walked into my first period. The day kinda went by fast. I dazed off. In third period, the Luke guy just keep staring at me. It made me a little uncomfortable. A little after it was already lunch time. I picked up all of my stuff and it didn't fit all of the stupid crap the teacher gave us. So I had to carry a whole ton of sh*t. I walked out of the room not paying attention. I then fall to the ground running into someone. "Sh*t." I say under my breath. Then I see someone squat down next to me, helping me pick up my stuff. "I'm so sorry about that." The person said. "Oh it's fine. Stuff happens." I say. I look up and see it's the blonde boy. "Oh hi." I say. "Hi." He says back. "Thank you..for uh..helping me pick up my crap." I say laughing. "Anytime." He says. "Uh yea." I say getting up. "I'm Luke by the way." He says putting his hand out for me to shake. "Uh Sage, Sage Hall." I say taking his hand for a shake. "Well Sage, it was nice to meet you." He says smirking. "Uh it was nice to meet you too." I say. "I'll see you around." He says walking away. What the sh*t just happened? I started walking to the Cafeteria. I walk in and get in line to get my lunch. I then try to find the table my friends were at. Then I notice them at the table by the boys bathroom. I walk over and sit next to Alaric. "Hey Sage." He says. "Hi." I reply. They all had their conversations. Then I feel a pair of eyes on me. Realizing it was Luke. I still felt weird with him always staring at me.
