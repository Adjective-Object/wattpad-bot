The portal stops moving. All of the Mystery Shack had been shaken or broken by the anomalies. Dipper, Mabel, Stan, and Soos fall to the ground. Dipper sits up, grabs his hat, and helps Mabel up."Well, you fell for my trap, sweet Shooting Star!" A familiar voice shouted, and then Dipper realized it as the evil cackling came from Stan."G-grunkle Stan?" Mabel whispered as Stan took off a mask to reveal Bill Cipher."Well, well!" He smiled crookedly, and looked towards the stabilized portal, "You are very gullible, Shooting Star! But I must say, I can thank you for bringing my favorite people to this Universe."Dipper and Mabel looked at each other, confused, as two figures walked through the portal."Pine Tree, Shooting Star, meet Dipper and Mabel Gleeful!" Dipper and Mabel Pines stared at each other."Ugh, I am ugly in this world!" Said Girl Gleeful, smirking at the Pines. "So are you, Dipper! That hat is gross."Dipper Pines shifted his hat, and yelled at Bill, "What do you want from us?!"Bill smiled. "Oh, just a deal. Hear me out kid."Mabel looked at Dipper, shaking her head."What do you need, Bill?" Dipper Pines finally asked.Bill sighed and looked at the Gleefuls, then back at the Pines."I want to become human again."
