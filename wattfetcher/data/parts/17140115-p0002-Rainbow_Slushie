(normal voice) Hey guys! This is my super crazy, super weird book that will make you feel like you just went through  the choclate tunnel in the  old Charlie and the Choclate factory movie. I'm just kidding about that last part, but if you are a person that is easily scared, I might  have been making a scared derp face screaming "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" until you read the part after that. Anyways this book is supposed to be super silly but weird enough that it will make you snort when laugh. Okay, well, Rainbows is waiting for you peace. Also I forgot, Rainbows likes to be dared so dare her if you want. Bye! Eat burritos! ~ ♡ readthebooks200 ♡
