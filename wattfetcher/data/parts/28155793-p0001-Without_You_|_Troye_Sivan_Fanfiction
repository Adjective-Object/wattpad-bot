My name's Riley. I'm 16 years old and I go to Bridgewater High. I have been bullied in the past and I used to cut. I still have scars. I have long brown hair and light green eyes. I got those traits from my mom. I don't have a dad. He's been divorced from my mom since I was 3 and I don't see him. It's not easy for me to communicate with people. I'm incredibly shy. My best friend is a guy. I can't stand having girl friends. I get good grades in school. If I get called on by a teacher to read a sentence outloud to the whole class, I stutter and can't make it. Sometimes I run out of class and cry in the bathroom from embarrassment until next period starts. I hate my life.
