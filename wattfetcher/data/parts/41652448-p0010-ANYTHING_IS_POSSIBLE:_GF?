Pacifica: Welcome to Northwest Manor dorks. Try not to touch anythinG

then Mabel goes ahead touching everything.

Mabel: everything's so fancy *tocuhes floor* fancy floor, *touches plant* fancy plant *gasps, and starts touching a mans face* fancy man!

Candy: the rumors were true!

She he open the basket letting a quill out.

Mackenzie: if we say anything, it could turn the only episode around. Let's just stay quiet and only talk when no ones listening.

Zoe: ugh. Fine.

Preston: hopefully you can help us with our little situation Before the gues arrive in an hour.

Dipper: I'll do my best.

Preston: splendid. Pacifica will take our guest to the problem room and *whispers while pointing at Dipper* he's not earring that is he?

Pacifica: I'm on it.

Dipper: ow. It's like this collar is strangling me
