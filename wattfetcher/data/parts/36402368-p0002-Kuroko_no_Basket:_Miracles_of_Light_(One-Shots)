~Kise's POV~
"Ugh!! I can't believe I fell in love with her!" I shouted but it came in muffled sound because I was covering my face with my pillow.
*ring... Ring.....*
"Who could it be su~? Moshi moshi? Hai? Eh? (First name)-cchi is not yet home!? In this rain!? Yes. Yes. I'll look for her. Thanks."
"Ugh!! That idiot...she was trying to talk to me. I should have listened to her! Maybe I was wrong.Anyways no time or moping around."
I looked for her everywhere but I couldn't find her. The last place I haven't checked out yet is the park near the Maji Burger. There she is in a swing. I called to her but she wasn't responding to me so I grabbed her shoulders and called out to her.
"(First name)-cchi! (First name)-cchi! Oi!!""Eh? Ryou what are you doing here?""I should be the one asking you that!" "Eh? I-I was just swinging. See?"
~Your POV~
Ryou found me but I can't tell him why I was here....
"Stop lying. Seriously in this rain!?"Why would he be mad? It's not like he care right? I was calling to him earlier but he just ignored me. "Yup! I wanted to try it!""Stop lying (first name). I can see through it.""Sorry.""About what?""I don't know I know if I did something to upset you but whatever it is, I want to explain. If it's about (male friend's name)-kun it was just a friendly hug.""But do you really have to do that?""I declined his confession and I don't know other way to cheer him up. Sorry."
"Come on." He left you there again. As soon as you stand, you toppled over because of your ankle. "Ittai.....""(First name)-cchi! Are you alright?" "It kinda hurts a bit but I'm fine.""Here..." He dropped down and gave me a piggy back ride. "Are you still mad at me?""Nope...how about we stop at Maji Burger?""Sure! But I'm drenched up.""Here." He said as he give you his sweater. "Thanks!"
=At Maji Burger="Are you sure you're not mad at me anymore?""Yes su~ see?""But----""It's fine really.""But Ryou-HMPH!"He kissed me and soon you kissed him back. "I like you (first name)-cchi. Ever since I helped you so let me ask you this. Will you be my girlfriend?"
"Yes. Ryouta."And with that he kissed you again.
------------Extra: "So you were jealous of him?""I-it's not really like that su~" "Hehehehe don't worry Ryou you're the only one I love!"You kissed him passionately.
