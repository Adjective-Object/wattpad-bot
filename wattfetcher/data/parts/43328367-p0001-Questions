If you could kill anyone and get away with it, how would you do it? (Disclaimer- this may get violent-----Easy. If put in the hypothetical situation then I'd start with chaining them to some surface to which there would be no escape, then I would slowly skin them alive, pull out their nails one by one, pull out their teeth, cut out their tongue, rip out their hair, cut open their stomachs and pull out their organs, cut open the skull and take out the brain, and remove the eyes all while I have Tiny Tim playing in the background. That would at least be my method of murder. It was inspired by cupcakes and muffins (two MLP grim dark fanfics). I guess my reason for why it was so brutal is because I have a lot of hate that I direct towards the world and it's people; but my therapist is helping with that so I should be fine. That's all for this time. Be sure that you suggest questions in the comments please. It can be anything. Cya~
