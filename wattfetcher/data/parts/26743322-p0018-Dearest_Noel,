dearest noel,

i've been in the hospital for over 8 hours noel.
i haven't heard nothing as yet from the doctors noel.

i'm so scared noel. i can't lose her. i can't lose the one person who's always been there for me, noel.

i can't bare the thought of losing her.
there's so many machines.

they're all just beeping and beeping.
i want it all to stop.

i want it all to be just a bad fucking nightmare. but isn't, is it?

why is everyone leaving me?
