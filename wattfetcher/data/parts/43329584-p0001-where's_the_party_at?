*Luke's P.O.V*hey I'm luke and I like to party. well that's what my Instagram bio says so I guess it's true. you probably already know this but I'm from a band called 5 seconds of summer and we've been well known for a few years now. we've released our first album and been on a few tours. we even toured with one direction which was pretty cool and I guess this is where the story starts back in 2013 when we were touring with them.
we had some pretty good times and don't get me wrong, I love the boys but sometimes they were just a bit too wild. after concerts they'd invite fans backstage (which I didn't even know was possible) and basically abuse them. the poor girls were so excited to be meeting the boys they'd do whatever they said. the one direction boys would act interested and get their numbers and then completely forget about them and do it all again.
we went to so many exclusive parties and met so many people I couldn't even remember all of them. we were at a party and then I happened. the worst possible thing.
*A.N*hey guys I'm Maddy and I'm writing this story. just want to let all of you guys know that I completely made this up, I haven't taken it from anywhere and it isn't true that one direction abuses girls after concerts (well not to my knowledge). thanks for reading and I'll try my best to upload regularly and I look forward to getting to know some of you guys :)links: Instagram: maddymuscatsnapchact: maddy_jayne2707Twitter: maddy_jayne27ask.fm: maddy_hemmingsvine: maddy jayne
