Standing on my own. Here I am alone. You lied to me. Everyone leaves but I'm pushing you away. You aren't fair. I'm angry, I'm abused, I'm used and I'm empty. You already killed one daughter. I won't be the second. You lost me. Tell me I'm worthless again, I know it. I feel no bond to you. It's your fault I'm so unattached. I broke someone's heart and felt nothing.My mother died and I didn't break. You hit me and I shrugged. He hit me and I didn't struggle. I don't know what feelings are. I never have. I never will. What a time to be alive
