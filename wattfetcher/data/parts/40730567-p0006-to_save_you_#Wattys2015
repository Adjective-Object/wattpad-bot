Honestly? I am terrified of the future. Idk what I will do with my life. And that scares me. I don't like not knowing what will happen next, I guess. Hbu?

My biggest fear is that I would be oblivious to my children's suffering, as my parents were. (well if I have any children) that my kids would cry themselves silently and I wont be able to hear them. I wouldn't know if they were broken, just like I am.

Jake felt the depth of this person's words. He knew that they were hurting.

His eyes widened at the answer of that anonymous person. He was so sure that it was a girl. After reading the next text though, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Jake didn't know why he was so happy at the fact that this anonymous person was a girl. But he was a guy after all.

this was such a bad chapter. but like my main goal was to talk about the fears basically. (which are my top two fears as well). and i guess i accomplished that (well kinda). pls pls read ; vote ; comment. constructive criticism is appreciated. (or if you wanna tell me that my book is shit, that's fine too idrc)
