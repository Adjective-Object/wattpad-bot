Hinata always had a rivalry with Kageyama and yet had always relied on him for those deviant fast attacks during games. Hinata looked up to find a ball flying at his face and in seconds he was on his back. Again. "HINATA" the angry voice of Kageyama yelling at him from the other side of the net, "YOU STUPID IDIOT!" Kageyama was always angry at him and Hinata learned to ignore it, but somewhere in his heart it pained him to see him get angry at him. Kageyama  was the strongest person he knew yet he hated him so much. What were the odds?
Kageyama looked on as Hinata walked off slouching and dragging his feet, Kageyama's arm raising to reach after his dejected friend. Putting the arm down Kageyama wondered what he would do with him. Stupid, too trusting, and over eager but most of all Hinata had a strong heart, something Kageyama's insecure heart would never be, or so he thought. Kageyama felt the need to protect Hinata's innocence and ran after him. Cash in hand to buy them both some curry buns at the hill bottom store. Hinata turned back and smiled at him happiness sparkling in his eyes.
(Hinata and Kageyama at the same time)
He couldn't give up on him just yet, because one day he'd become stronger than anyone, even him.
