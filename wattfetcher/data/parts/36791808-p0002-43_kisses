MIA'S POV
"NICK!! BREAKFAST IS READY" i called for my lazy brother , we were already late and he is still taking a shower.
'hey little one!" Nick said "stop calling me that!"
"why are you making breakfast? where's mom?"
"she had to go early today"
mom is always working late , we're used to that but this week, she is going early too . so i have to do everything. it's not that i'm complaining , i'm used to that.
after breakfast i went to my room to get dressed as fast as possible, i wore a sundress as always, i love them! . anyway , i put my hair in a ponytail, currently my hair is brown with blonde ends, but it won't last for long cause i dye my hair a lot.
me and Nick arrived to school just before my first period , i saw my bestfriend zoe and her boyfriend , i said hi , before i could say anything else the bell rang , so zoe kissed ethan and we said bye. our first class was history , so we went to our class.
__________LUNCH__________
<no one's pov>
mia,zoe and ethan sat together at lunch . they were talking when Dylan called ethan. dylan is ethan and nick's classmate , they are not best friends but they hang out from time to time . ethan exused him self and went to talk to dylan, zoe gave mia a look, so mia knew what she was thinking , she was about to start one of her crazy conversations
"i would totally date him" said zoe
"you have a boyfriend zoe . for god's sake hahaa"  we laughed and then zoe said something that shocked me
"why don't you date him then?"she said seriously
"what?" i started blushing , ugh i hate blushing "i don't even like him"
"why are you blushing then?" she started laughing "i know you better than you know yourself , you do like him"
"ok fine i do, but who doesn't , he is everygirl's dream"
"who is?" asked ethan
"no one" said mia
"girls you won't believe what dylan told me"
"what?!" both girls asked loudly
"mia, your brother is having a party at YOUR house on-"

"why , it's just i party" zoe said
"you know i hate parties"
"but you're good at them , eveybody likes you , by everybody i mean boys" zoe said with a wink
