Germany rushed over to his friend. "Japan!!"
"It's no good... Besides, the more memories I get, the stronger the enemy becomes...
Anymore of this--" Japan thought dimly.
Italy clenched his fists and muttered, "I knew it..."
He looked at his friends with teary eyes and spoke once more, "Japan... Germany... Prussia. I'm sorry. Looks like we couldn't make it again...
It's got stronger than in the beginning... I can't do this alone..."
"I-Italy?" Prussia said, confused.
Germany turned to his Italian friend. "Come on! Just run--"
"I'm sorry. I made a mistake yet again..." He said helplessly, stepping in front of the
Thing.
"You idiot!!" Germany yelled.
Germany covers Italy from the monster.
"West!! Ita--" Prussia cried, trying to pull the two out of the way...but he was too
late.
>>Lost Italy and Germany.<<

Japan: (I would still lose my friends in this case...
What can I do...? We might as well not come here at all. But if we do that, I'm sure you are going to show me yet another future, isn't that right?
You'll only tell me about the worst ends in which no matter what choice I make, I'll end up losing someone!)
What can I do? What's the best thing I can do?

The screen fades to black and time starts to move once more. Everything goes back to normal, letting me move again.

"Are you all right, Japan?" I asked.
Japan placed his fingers on his temples. "... Yes."
"How about you, ____? We noticed that you don't see those fake memories, but you somehow become weakened or something... " I inquired, worried about the young lady.
"I'm..fine, thanks. I don't feel that drained..." She told me.
America turned to us and spoke, "That wasn't as fun as I thought it'd be. Um, so, which one is real, again?"
"Try to sort it out while we go back. If you still can't figure it out, ask Germany. Heisn't being affected for some reason. Or, _____'s here." I told him, pointing at ______.
She nodded. "Yeah. I've gathered some info on how you guys arrived here. So we can talk about it on our way back to the others."
"Right.. Thanks, dudette." America said, smiling at her.
While we were making sure there wasn't anything of interest that'll get left in the room, I noticed America staring at me, looking like he was deep in thought.
"...By the way, England, you look unfocused. How many fingers am I holding up?"
America asked, holding up his fingers in front of me.
After hearing that I saw that _____ suddenly looked away... I wonder what's wrong?
