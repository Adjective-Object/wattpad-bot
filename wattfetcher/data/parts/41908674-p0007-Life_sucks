Rosa pov.I was so nervous about today. Like seriously nervous. I took a deep breath and grabbed Jasmine, Sasha, Joshy and James and we headed to the deans office. Where Mr Monkey was. My favourite teach, den and he was my house dean. I knocked on the door of the office. "Come in." Mr Monkey said. We entreed. "Why hello miss Spencer. How can I help you and your friends today.?" Mr asked. "Well you know Christina Pay?? well she has been bulling me and blaming my friends for donig things that she actually did." I said as calmly as possible. "Hmmm do you have any evidence on that Rosa? Mr Monkey said voice full of concern. "Yes we do." I answered.  we all got out our phones and showed him what Christina has been doing and saying to us. "Well thenshe will be put in detention for the whole year from today onwards." Mr yelled. "Tankyou Mr Monkey." I said my voice full of joy. We left the office and went to room 5.  Where Christina was. "Lets go!" I whispered to James. We were about to leave when Christina spoke. "Rosa meet me at Room 25 at lunch because we are gonna fight and see who is stronger." "Ok whatever Tina." I yelled as we walked off I was so ready to fight her since I already know what's gonna happen and I must decide what happens when she chokes me. I seriously couldn"t wait.  "James can I talk to you a lone?" I asked my boyfriend. "Yeah sure. What doyou want to talk about babe?" he said. I will need your help at a certain stage during the fight. Ok I want Jazz, Joshy, Sasha and you yo be ther to support me." said as the bloody bell rang for class to start. "Ok.  We will." he whispered before kissing me.
