I had this  idea of a story in the back burner for almost  2 years. I came up with it with my friends in chorus as a joking idea because of how much we love the supernatural and how hot some  guys can look with beards or a bit of stubble. We first called it Beauty & the Beard, because honestly it was funny but really catchy. It had fitted in with our ideas of something close to a fairy tale but I thought it wasn't enough. So I messed around with the idea, written a couple  summaries for its description and got this and the name: My Eyes Are Up Here. I had plotted most of it out but it was never finished because honestly  I'm the type to write then edit and rewrite before I post.
And now without further ado I introduce you guys to my story._______________________________________

Thinking about the times when I was a kid I felt like a life sized Barbie for my mom, it never was a dull day or comfortable one when she continuously made me be in pageants and with the help of my godmother it got way more uncomfortable. Imagine your clothes changing around with a snap of my godmother's finger and all you feel in a drift of wind whooshing around you too quick to even understand what happened. Yeah, not an enjoyable feeling that drift when I think about it. But I had to go with it because it was my mom. She really took over my life back then, and she's trying so hard now.
Did I mention that my godmother's a witch? Yep, let me clarify that weird moment of  thinking why would my clothes change with the snap of her fingers. As a kid I was stuck in the middle about how I should feel about the supernatural. I like my godmother, and she's a great witch along with some of her other friends I met who are in the same coven as her.
I'm okay with witches, I'm okay with werewolves, I'm okay with other kind of shifters, I'm okay with pixies even though they're too dangerous to play with so I don't bother,  but I'm really not so sure about vampires. Never really met a vampire which makes me unsure. Knowing that the supernatural world is out in the open was bad at the beginning as humans pretty much went on a rampage out of fear. But now everyone has calmed down just enough that they live in harmony. All beings who had some kind of royalty came out with it and the world ended up with more princes and princesses.
Something that my family treated me like, a princess,  especially my mom. She loves trying to arrange relationships between me and whichever guy she thinks would seem like a fit. But honestly those casanovas really don't fit.
