A/n Amanda above
Her. That's all she's called, nothing else. Her. She had a name but no one knew it, no one cared enough to know it.
Meet Amanda Edwards, also known as Her. She is the girl who is avoided in the halls, the girl who is feared, the girl who hates you if you even breath in her direction. Nobody tries to become friends with her and she doesn't try to make them, simple as that. But what happens when a pair of energetic, noses, extremely social twins moves right down the street?
Meet Samantha and Elizabeth Lee, the twins that were just mentioned a few seconds ago. Samantha also known as Sam has always been the tomboy of the two girls, she always liked sport, art, and girls (that's right she's gay bitches). Elizabeth also known as Liz has always been the more girly of the two and wants to be the friend of the world.
So what happens when Liz drags Samantha into one of her crazy plans of make friends with Amanda? That's right they're going to try and be friends with Her. Read on to find out how this adventure goes.
