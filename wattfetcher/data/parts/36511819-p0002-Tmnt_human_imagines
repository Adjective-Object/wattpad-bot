"If you need more help, i'll be here!" He said than he got away the same way he appeared: you didn't notice him going away.
MichelangeloðŸ’›You were at the skate park doing skate moves, escaping from the world. Your parents were always aguing and pretending they cared. The only reason they stay together is for money. They make more money together. Anyway, you didn't care because you were always out.
You were perfectioning moves and figures you learned from random person there.
"Woohoo!" You heard someone cheer. You look for the guys who beongs the voice, but, eventually, you fell.
"Wow dudette, are you alright?" He said. "Yeah, thanks, dude!" You said.
"Whoa, those eyes!" He said but then blush when he realised you heard him.
"My name is Michelangelo, you?"
"(Y/N)"
He had blue eyes that makes him looks super cute and had blond hair. He looked like the cheery type. The type you like!
You heard a phone ring. It wasn't yours, but Michelangelo's. He answer and talked. He then, hang up.
"Hey, dudette, let's meet up here tomorow. My bros will be so fricking mad if i don't show up now." He said. You just nod. He was running away, taking a latter and climb for the roof and waved from there. You waved back.
"Bye, michelangelo. See you tommorow" you said low but hoping he heard that in his mind. Then, you had to go you too!
