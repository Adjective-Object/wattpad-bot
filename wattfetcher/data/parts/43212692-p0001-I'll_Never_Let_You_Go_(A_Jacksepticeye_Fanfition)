I'm on the plane, sitting there quietly. I haven't talked at all for the past day. The plane finally rumbles down the runway. It might have taken 5 minutes, but it felt as it had taken an eternity to land. I grabbed my two suitcases and dragged them down the aisle and off the plane. I heard my phone go off, Jacksepticeye's outro being my ringtone. I slightly jumped when I heard it. I answer my phone. I'm wearing my JSE hoodie, my Markiplier T-shirt and my Wilfred Wharfstache tights. I walk down to gate 420 (haha) where I'm supposed to meet my grandma and grandpa. My grandma was on the phone.
(V= Violet G= Grammy)
V- Hey grammy, where are you?
G- We're at the gate by the fountain.
V- kay, be there in a minute
G- By the way, welcome to Ireland sweetie.
I put my phone down and went to the gate. There I saw many other people getting off of a plane. I saw them and they looked at my clothes.
"What are you wearing? Pink mustaches? An M? A green eyeball? Care to explain Violet?"
My grandma said. I was clenching my left hand into a fist so hard that my knuckles started to turn purple.
"Okay, fine. The mustaches and the M stands for Markiplier, and the eyeball is for Jacksepticeye."
My grandma didn't seem any more amused. We finally went to their car and drove back to their apartment. Tomorrow, I go to CloverPatch High. (best name for an Irish Highschool!) The only other reason I'm excited is because I'm in the same country as Jacksepticeye. I know I'm fangirling like a girl that just met the most famous person in the world, or Selena Gomez. This is going to be the best place ever. I just know it.
