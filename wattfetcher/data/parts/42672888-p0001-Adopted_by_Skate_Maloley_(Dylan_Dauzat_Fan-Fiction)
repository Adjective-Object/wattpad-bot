Skate's POV:
"Bro, I want a daughter." I told Jack Johnson.(JJ)
"Are you kidding??" asked Wilkinson.
"Shut the F*** up. No one was talking to you" I told Wilkinson.
"Bro, its you're decision. I mean girls are a lot of work." said JJ.
"Unlike boys, all you have to worry about is him being a player, condoms, sex, one night stands, and getting a girl pregnant." said Glinisiky.
"Which everything he said falls under the sex category. So yeah boys you have to worry about sex. Girls you have to deal with them monthly. Especially with there period." said Wilkinson smirking.
"No, I'm serious. I want a 13 year-old girl." I told them.
"Ok let's go." said JJ.
"hey can you guys call the other boys so they can met the girl and clean the house. Please." I told them.
"Yeah sure." said Glinisiky.
"Thanks." I told them.
"No problem." said Wilkinson.
