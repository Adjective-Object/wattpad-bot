I nervously slid the card into three-B's slot and took my bills upstairs. I made it to my apartment and heard talking upstairs. I strained my ears to hear what they were saying.
"Yeah... Haha.... Bye... Joey!" A voice that sounds so deep and masculine laughed. I know who it is. It's that "Q" guy.
The same blued eyes man walked down the stairs and never even noticed me. I shrugged. No one ever noticed me.
I heard barking and hissing and knew Percy and Prim knew that I was out here. I laughed and opened the door. Robyn tackled me in a hug."Woah, Robyn, I saw you two days ago," I laughed pushing her off of me.
"I know, but I can't miss my best friend, or what?" Robyn asked, her humor in her voice.
"Robyn," I asked, "Did you put Percy in my bedroom before you opened my door?"
Robyn's face turned pale. She shook her head. Percy ran out of my apartment and ran to the stairs. "No!" I shrieked, knowing if he ran down the stairs he could get lost in the big Staten Island town.
Percy charged upstairs and I let out a sigh of relief. I ran after him and saw his tail disappear into a door that was a crack open.
It was "Q's" door.
The color left my face and I moaned. Why of all doors that happen to be left open Percy ran into Q's door?
"Woah! Slow down boy!" Q's voice rang through the hall. I cringed and softly knocked on the open door.
Q looked up at me and I felt my heart beat faster. "Is this your dog?" He asked, scratching Percy behind the ears.
I nodded solemnly. "Y-yeah. Percy's my dog," I state the obvious. Q nods. "He's adorable," He cooed, giving Percy a kiss on the head.
Dude, you're the adorable one.
"I know," I admitted, because Percy is so adorable. "How modest!" Q laughed and made me giggle.
Q stood up and stuck out his hand. I shook it and felt jolts of tingles ring through my body. I dropped his hand and got Percy.
"Sorry. Again," I blushed, apologizing for then and that morning. He nodded and smiled.
"It's cool. My name is Brian Quinn, though. And you are..." Brian smiled, waiting for my name. "Michelle. Michelle Collins," I said.
Brian ran a hand through his long hair and sighed. "Well, see you around, I guess," He said awkwardly, wanting me to leave. "Oh- yeah. Um... Bye?" I stammered, and left with Percy at my heels.
I got to my apartment and gave Prim and Percy their dinner. I laid on my sofa with my eyes closed. My stomach growled and Robyn handed me a sandwich.
"Thanks," I mumbled, devouring the sandwich. Robyn yawned and said bye, off to her house. I grabbed my laptop and decided to see who Brian Quinn really is. His name sounds familiar.
Prim leaped up on to the sofa and nestled herself on my lap. Percy curled up by my feet. I typed Brian Quinn into Google and the first thing that came up was, Brian Quinn Impractical Jokers.
I've never heard that before. "Impractical Jokers". I clicked it and was greeted to a picture of four men, one of them Brian and the other blue eyed man. There was a paragraph explaining what Impractical Jokers was.
I clicked and read it quickly.
