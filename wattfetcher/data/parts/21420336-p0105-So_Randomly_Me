Anyways hi
I haven't updated in a while but I'm in the mood to rant
Doesn't everyone have those friends that like NEVER stop complaining about their lives
Like I get it
Your life sucks
But i can't do anything about it so get a therapist
You know what I also hate
Ranters
((Ironic I know))
They hate on everything
Like seriously calm down and get a life
XD okay I'm sorry
So has anyone wondered why I haven't ranted too much about blood of Olympus
Its because I'm pretending the book never happened
If I keep thinking that
The series wont end
:)
When people ask me to go places I'm like
"Nah my Mom wont let me."
When in reality I just wanna read fanfics
