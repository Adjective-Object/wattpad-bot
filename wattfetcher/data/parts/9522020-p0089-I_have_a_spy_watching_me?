"No way! Your lying!" He said.
"Nope! I just got back and had a very serious problem in life. He said that he'll take it slow on me." She said with a grin.
Morse started to mutter at that when Garrett showed up.
"Hey Kiara. You wanted to talk?" He said.
"Actually I wanted to state that we are no longer a couple." She said with a shrug.
"What?" He asked.
"You and I are no longer together." She restated.
"Wait. You're breaking up with me. Why?" He asked.
"I have eyes all around the school." She replied. "I heard that my best friend saw you making out with someone."
"So you'll just assume that she did see me kissing someone." He stated and he looked kind of mad.
"Yeah, pretty much. Plus we aren't going anywhere with this Garrett. There is no reason we should be together if we are just acting like strangers." She says with a shrug.
"What ever Kiara." He muttered and left.
"Wow, that was easier than I thought." She said.
"You're a weird person." Morse said.
"You're a weird brother." Kiara countered. Wait, they're siblings. Shoot. I hope she doesn't bring up seeing me at a bar. She looks over at me and looks confused. "Wait... Don't I know you?"
Dang I was hoping she wouldn't remember me.
"I don't think so. My name is Chase." I said.
"Oh! I remember you! You were that kid that Garrett introduced to me that one time. How old are you?" She asked out of no where.
"He's my age, but he's a few months older than I am." Jaycie said.
She looked confused. She looked about ready to talk until the bell rang.
"Well it was nice seeing you again. How about you tell me the question later? Let's go, Jaycie. We got to go to class. I'll walk with you." I say.
"Sure thang!" She said with a grin as she walked on the chairs and jumped next to me.
I rolled my eyes and we walked out and I slowly reached for her hand. When I touched her hand I saw that she was turning red as I intertwined our hands slowly. She smiled though and had held my hand. I grinned and we walked to class since we had the same class. Okay to be honest, my mom switched my schedule to have every single class with her, but no one knows. The only classes that didn't change was Band class, P.E., and Literature.

*Jaycie's POV*
I was alone during my third class because Chase went to go talk to the teacher then he grabbed his stuff and left while I was working on my work. He told me that he'd be back, but as time passed I just thought that he meant later on today. At least, I hope.
"Jaycie, you seemed to be a bit dazed. Any problem with the work?" Mr. Canon, my history teacher, asked.
"Oh no sir. I was just thinking about something. Sorry Mr. Canon." I replied.
"You feeling alright?" He asked. "I can call your father if you want me to."
"Oh no, I'm completely fine sir. Thank you for the offer of calling my dad, but I don't want to bother him at work. Thank you though." I said getting back to work.
