Speaking of the ranks, I spy with my little eye popular people.
Lets see what I'm dealing with here.
Short brunette, guy, nearly black not as short as me though. Aghhh! High pitch laugh that hurt my ears.
Tall brunette, guy, messy hair and guessing by the ground shaking, deep voice.
Medium hight black haired, guy, medium pitched voice.
Medium hight brunette, gal, glasses and medium pitched voice.
And finally a giant.
LITERALLY ok properly Kirstie.
Ok REALLY tall blonde, guy, medium pitched voice. Dreamy blue eyes boring into mine lighting up my soul like- wait WHAT? Bad girl no emotions for you! Wait he's staring at me back, just keep walking Kirst, that's it now glare. Good.
Umph
OW
Someone tripped me!
Ok how to deal with being tripped get up, fight them, hope you win or a teacher stops it.
I look up to see the girl.
Ugh girls.
I get up slowly while they are laughing.
Now one thing to know about me is I took self defence classes and I know all the fancy tricks. So I spin and kick her face landing her on the ground. I smirk pick up my stuff and walk off.
How I love the first day!
