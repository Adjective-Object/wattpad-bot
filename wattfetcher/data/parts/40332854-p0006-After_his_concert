I'm skipping ahead in the story. By the way. That is a totally random date down there. (:*5 Months Later*(January 5th, 2016)
JoeI woke up the next morning with a smile on my face. I kissed Julia's forehead and said "Good Morning beautiful" She responded with "Good Morning handsome" Julia and I are still together, we are very happy together. She's been staying at my house a lot more now, so I was thinking that it's time to ask her to move in. Julia (POV)I'm really starting to believe that I'm falling in love with Joe. He's a really great person to be around. He's funny, charming and absolutely sexy. I'm so lucky to have him as mine. Last week he took me to meet his family, I really love them. Denise and Paul are very sweet. Nick, and Frankie are really happy that Joe finally has someone to make him happy. Unfortunately I didn't meet Kevin, Danielle and Alena, but I have a feeling that I will soon.
JoeI decided to ask Julia now..."Hey Jules..I was wondering, would you like to move in? I really want you here, I'm in love with you and I want you to live with me." When I asked her that question she had the biggest smile on her face and she said "I would love to" I told her that we would go pick up all of her stuff after breakfast. After breakfast we got ready and went to her place to get all of her stuff. I'm very happy that she is finally moving in. "Julia..." She said "Yes Joe?" "I love you" she replied with "I love you too Joe!" then she kissed me. I'm going to ask her a very important question in February. I'm excited to see what she says.
