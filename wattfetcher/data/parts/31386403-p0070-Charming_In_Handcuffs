James started to stir and I knew he was starting to wake up. He squeezed me gently before unwrapping himself from me and stretching out his arms. Just about that time, my bedroom door flew open. Lindy's sarcastic smile was plastered against her lips as she stepped into my room, "And what do we have here?" She plopped down at the edge of my bed and looked at James. "Who are you? And why are you in my best friends bed?"
James just laughed and stood up, "I'll go find Mere." He ran his hands through his bed hair, but it oddly suited him. James walked out, closing the door behind him.
I turned my attention to Lindy, "Good morning to you, too."
"That's James? The other half of the evil twin?"
I nodded and pushed myself up in bed, "Except not so evil anymore."
"It seems you and James were quite cozy."
"It's not like that at all. We were just talking and we fell asleep."
She shrugged her shoulders, "He clearly likes you."
I let out a shaky breath, trying to choose my next words carefully, "I like someone else."
And she knew that. "I understand. But, I am here to kidnap my gorgeous best friend because I haven't seen you all week." She pushed out her bottom lip.
"Fine." I threw my blankets off my body, "I'll meet you downstairs in a few."
"Can't wait."
I think I could probably use a few extra hours of sleep.

I'll probably do Jack's point of view in a couple of chapters. I already have the next one written, and started the next, sooooo Jack's point of view will have to wait for at least two more chapters, hahaha.
Hope you liked this one! Let me know what you think, hopefully it's not too bad, lol.
You guys are the BEST! :)
