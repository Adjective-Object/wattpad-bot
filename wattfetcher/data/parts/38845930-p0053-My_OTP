"I want to move in together!" She screamed hugging me.
"Wow, yes!" I said.
"I want to move in together!" She screamed again.
"Yeah." I said.
"I love you." She said.
"I love you."
We got ready for bed and lied down.
"Whatcha doin'?" She asked rolling over to me putting her head on my arm.
"I'm checking interweb stuff." I said.
"Is it cool interweb stuff?" She asked.
"Yeah, I guess. What do you want?" I asked in a fake mad tone.
"I'm excited." She said.
"About?"
"We're going to live together." She said looking straight up at the ceiling with her hand on her stomach.
"Yeah, that would be something to be excited about." I said turning to look at her.
"I love you." She said as if I didn't know already.
"You know I know that, right? I love you and I know you know it." I said.
"You're so c -- I don't... know how you are living right now, your cuteness should be killing you." She said rolling back over to me making me put my hand on her hip.
"You want me dead?" I asked.
"Jordan." She snorted, we laughed over her snort and kissed before actually turning off the light.
--I dont know how else to make it clear that it's the next morning--
"Jordan?" She asked.
"Yeah, baby?" I asked waking up from my state of light sleeping.
I rolled over to face her and I put my hand where I assumed she was only to realize the voice came from closer to the doorway.
"Can you help me?" She asked.
"What?" I asked after clearing my throat.
"I'm gonna take a shower and I usually get Boo's help, can you cover my cast?"
"Sure." I said as I got up out of bed.
