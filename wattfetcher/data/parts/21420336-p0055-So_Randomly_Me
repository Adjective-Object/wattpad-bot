ALL I WANTED WAS A CHICKEN WINGG
BUT THEY SHUT DOWN MCDONALDS
AND BURGER KINGGGGG
gosh
That song was so emotional
My feels
They're dead
How tragic
Stupid feels
Stupid chicken wings-
Wait do they even sell chicken wings at those places?
Couldn't I just have gone to KFC?
Whatever
That's like saying
"Couldn't Nico just be bi."
No
What
Why would you even ask that
NICO IS THAT FAB GAY CHARACTER WE ALL LOVE
YOU UNDERSTAND?
Plus
If I were a demigod
(Cuz demigods don't exist pssshhh yeah mortals...))
I would be a daughter of hades
VIVA LA PLUTO! FUCK YOU!
