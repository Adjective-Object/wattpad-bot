Sky blue,Amber gold,Emerald green,Coal black,The color of your eyes,The color of your eyes
Your eyes, they hold something,Something no one has ever seenAnd as I get closer,I catch glimpse of itYour eyes, hold new places, new worldsYour eyes, yours eyesThey're like a portal into the sky
When I look into your eyesI see the sky,Dead stars, so full of lightDusk smiles at me every nightWhen I look into your eyes,When I look into your eyes
Your eyes, they hold something,Something no one has ever seenAnd as I get closer,I catch glimpse of itYour eyes, hold new places, new worldsYour eyes, yours eyesThey're like a portal into the sky
When I look into your eyesI see a covered up sun in the sky,The looming rain clouds over usThe death that's sure to beThe sunlight so blinding, I can't seeWhen I look into your eyesWhen I look into your eyes
Your eyes, they hold something,Something no one has ever seenAnd as I get closer,I catch glimpse of itYour eyes, hold new places, new worldsYour eyes, yours eyesThey're like a portal into the sky
When I look into your eyesI see the dusk sky,Blue and green embers although out the nightDull and dark,The sky in your eyes was oh so starkWhen I look into your eyesWhen I look into your eyes
Your eyes, they hold something,Something no one has ever seenAnd as I get closer,I catch glimpse of itYour eyes, hold new places, new world'sYour eyes, yours eyesThey're like a portal into the sky
When I look into your eyesI see the whole galaxy,The swirling meteorsThe darkness around me around meThe planets, never knowing which ones hold new lifeWhen I look into your eyesWhen I look into your eyes
Your eyes, they hold something,Something no one has ever seenAnd as I get closer,I catch glimpse of itYour eyes, hold new places, new worldsYour eyes, yours eyesThey're like a portal into the sky
