"Hey we figured you guys would be fighting all day so we decided we would watch a movie with y'all the whole magcon crew came in.
"Shawn can I see your guitar?" I asked, "Yeah can you play?" He asked I nodded, "A little." I said blushing I swear every time I look at Hayes he was staring at me then accuse me staring at him. He handed me his guitar, I checked to see if it was in the right place. I started to sing Shadow by Austin Mahone
"Only my shadow knows how I feel about you...only my shadow goes where I dream of you...should I go away is it to soon or too late...only my shadow knows." I sung then finished the rest of the song.
Hayes looks at me again, "I'll take you anywhere I'll put you on the throne I'll lay down my heart I swear...snd I'll make sure you'll never be alone...alone*high note*...only my shadow knows." then I finished the rest of the song and they clapped.
Hayes looked at me again, I smile, he smiles back, "I-I'm gonna go somewhere." I said, "Where are you going?" Cameron asked, "Like you ever cared." I snapped and opened the door, I started walking down the hall and turned around because it felt like I was being followed.
I turned around again to see Hayes laughing, "You looked so scared." he said laughing walking towards me, "Haha very funny." I said sarcastically. "Look what happened in the airport I didn't mean it I never meant it to happen, I don't want you to forget me and not forgive me." he said, "I'm so sorry." He said, I stood on my tiptoes, and hugged him wrapping my arms around his neck, he wrapped his around my waist.
"I forgive you." I said, "What happened to your shoulder?" He asked me my eyes widened and I quickly pulled away, "Shi* I forgot my sweater, "Did you?" He asked me, I let a tear slip and nodded, he hugged me again but tighter.
"Promise me that you won't do that anymore." Hayes said, "I promise." I said he nodded then kissed my forehead, "Do you think I should break up with Maxine?" He asked me we started to walk.
"Well I have bad news." I said, I opened my phone and pressed the recorded voice of what she said, "I can't believe her." she said, "You really wanna know what happened with my neck?" I asked him, he nodded, "Well she choked me to death." I said, "I'm so glad I opened the door." he said, "Why?" I asked him, "Well I wouldn't want to find the person I like dead." He smiled at me, I blushed.
"You like me?" I asked him, "Yeah, I was scared to tell you and that's why I was staring at you while you were singing." he said, "I mean I know I'm pretty hot but not that hot I mean zayum just saying." I said he chuckled, I giggled, "You are hot." He said, "Thanks...but where are we going?" I asked, he took me in a nail salon and told me he would pay for me.
He started getting texts from his ex, "She's really annoying." He said I giggled, "I bet." she said, I went with a mint green and pink on my nails with silver tape in the middle, when they finish drying Hayes pays and we walk other places, "Thank you." I smile, he grabs my hand, "Your welcome." he smiled back.
