Whenever you decide to take it, the snow will fall into your hands.When you feel hurt.When you feel alone.There is always someone there to ease your pain. Don't be afraid of being hurt.Because when you are afraid, you miss out on life.No matter what you do, no matter what you say, how you act. Maiṁ tumasē pyāra karatā hūm̐.Forever.
