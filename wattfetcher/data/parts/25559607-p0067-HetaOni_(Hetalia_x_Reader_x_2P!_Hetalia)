Meanwhile...
//England's PoV//
_____ and I noticed that Japan and America were still behind, so we decided to wait for them in the room that I wanted to look in. I turned to her and asked, "Mind if I check something in this room for a while, ____?"
She shook her head and smiled. "No. Go ahead. I was going to take a look on my phone and see if I could get a least a single bar of signal or something. But, what are you going to do here?"
"There's something unsettling about this room...Something that feels like it's pulling me..." I said, unknowingly in a dazed state.
"Hmm?"
I shrugged and snapped myself out of my thoughts. "O-Oh, it's nothing much.."
As _____ took her phone out and sat on one of the chairs, I went over to the bookshelves.
I flipped through the pages. I noticed ______ look at her phone with a shocked expression.Her face turned pale, as well.
"Is something wrong?" I asked her.
She looked up and turned to me, shaking her head. "N-No...It's just that...there's still no signal..ahaha... I guess I hoped too much."
"...Alright, then." I told her as I resumed looking through the books.
"Not here, either. Maybe... in the back of the bookshelf?" I mumbled to myself.
I grabbed the bookshelf and pulled it to the side so that I could see anything in the back. To my surprise, I saw some kind of seal.
Huh? A magic circle with my hand-writing? What is it doing here?
Well, whatever. Anyway, what is it sealing?
I placed my hand on the seal. A small glow emanated from it, but then grew to a giant flash of light.
"W-Wow. What was that just now, England?"  _____ exclaimed after uncovering her eyes from the sudden flash of light.
I suddenly felt a surge of strength return to me.
"Ooh! Some of my magic is back!" I told her happily.
*England's magic is 30% back.*
"R-Really? That's great!" She said, giving a warm smile.
"This is it! I was worried for a while there,but now I can at least try to fight the Thing if I need to!" I said, pumped up to show ______ my skills.
She was about to say something, when I saw Japan and America walk into the room.
"Hey, you two! What took you so long?!" I asked, raising an eyebrow.
Japan tilted his head. "Did something happen?"
"You could say that! Next time, I won't be such a burden any more." I announced.
America stepped forward and creased his forehead. "What, you were a burden before? Well, if you say so."
"Now I can easily stop that guy. Though only for a few seconds.Well... about two seconds..." I told them, starting to feel a little embarrassed.
They all fell silent. Even____ had a sullen look on her face all of a sudden. Japan and America looked at each other.
"Wh-what? If I can replenish it a little more, it can be longer--" I tried to defend myself.
