"It's really fun and stress relieving. I really love doing it."
"You look like you're having a lot of fun up there."
"I always am, it's amazing." I said just as our waitress came back and took our orders before walking off again.
"I bet," He said smiling a little. "I love taking pictures of you when you're up there, you're so energetic and happy and I get a lot of cute pictures of you."
I smiled at him, "You're the cutest thing."
"I know, that's why you like me."
"Yeah and you're funny, sweet, understanding and just perfect."
"Well I don't know about perfect." He muttered blushing a little.
"I'd say perfect."
He shook his head, "I'm not perfect."
"Why not?"
"Well nobody's perfect."
"Except you." I said just as my phone rang.
"No." He said just as I looked down at my phone and frowned pressing ignore. "Who's calling?"
"Nobody worth my time."
"Oh." He said dropping the subject.
I reached my hand across the table and grabbing his hand, "Really, its nothing."
"I know." He said smiling, "I trust you don't worry."
My phone rang again and I sighed pressing ignore once more when I saw his name on the screen. I wasn't going to let him ruin this.
"Why don't you just answer?" Alan asked just as the waitress came back with our food.
"Because tonight is about us and no one else."
He nodded, "Well then just turn off your phone that way no one can ruin it."
"I will." I said turning it on silent instead, you never know what could happen.
"Good, now let's eat." He said smiling.
I smiled at him and began eating with him. We made conversation throughout dinner before we finished and I paid for the meal, which he refused at first but I took him out.
"Ready for our little boat ride?" I asked him holding the door open as we walked out and down the ramp to the dock area where there was a small boat waiting for us.
He nodded, "Yeah, it's going to be so romantic." He said smiling.
"I hope so. Now I know it's a little, sketchy but it'll be fun." I told him stepping in and sitting down, "Come on in."
He stepped in and instead of sitting next to me he took a seat on my lap.
"You know I do have to row this thing right?"
"I don't care you look comfy, try to row with me sitting here." He said not moving.  I pulled the anchor up and set it down carefully in the boat.
"If we die, it's on you for sitting on me." I said and started rowing.
"Well," He shrugged. "At least I'll die happy."
"That's a plus."
"Yes it is."
I just smiled and kept rowing down the river till eventually stopping at a point where we could see the sunset.
