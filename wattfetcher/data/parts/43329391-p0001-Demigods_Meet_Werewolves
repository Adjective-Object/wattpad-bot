"The four demigods that learned the most, carried the most wits upon themselves, and went through the harshest environments during this war are to be chosen for an amazing prize."The goddess of wisdom stated.
She looked proud of herself, as if she's really outdone it. Yet something told me not to be too excited for anything this goddess decided to reward us with. Her gray eyes flitted around the group of us, studying each and everyone of our expressions.
We were in the Empire State Building, us Seven. All the gods and goddesses surrounded us in their specified seats. I laced my hands with Annabeth's in uneasiness. What was going to happen next?
"The choice has been made. Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Jason Grace, and Piper Mclean are the chosen heroes of this quest."
I looked to Frank, Leo, and Hazel, then stared at Athena in resentment. "What about them?"
"Oh, them," Athena stared upon my friends as if they were trash. "They weren't chosen, so they get to live a regular demigod life. But you four. Pack your bags and cheer out loud. Your going to high school."
Oh, great.
That's the first little segment. Hope you like it.
