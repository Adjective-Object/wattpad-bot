"Hello?"
"Hey! It's me" Liam's voice sounded through the device.
"What's up?" Zayn asked as he turned his back to Harry.
"Nothing much. How's it going with Harry?"
"I think it's going pretty good. I mean at least he isn't freaking out about Louis at the moment." Zayn shrugged.
"Oh come on, it isn't that bad."
"I know. I just wanted him to do something instead of spending his time at his own place or ours like he always does."
"Yeah. We're just doing this to cheer him up."
"Exactly."
Zayn turned around with his phone still glued to his ear. He searched for Harry with his eyes and winced once he did.
"Uh Li, I gotta go, Harry's in a situation." Zayn chuckled.
"Stay safe!"
"Thanks." Zayn said before stuffing his phone down his back pocket.
He jogged towards the helpless boy on the ground. Harry laid down on the ground with the side of his face pressed down to the concrete. He watched waringly as children passed him by.
"What the hell happened?" Zayn asked worriedly.
"I did pretty good in the beginning but once it was time to jump off I slipped and landed on my side." Harry started.
"Is that it?" Zayn said disappointedly.
"Well! I didn't want to be noticed by other kids so I decided to become one with the ground."
"You are so stupid." Zayn reached out his hand for Harry and pulled him up once Harry accepted his gesture.
"I would've said it was genius but that's just me." Harry shrugged and pulled his helmet off, revealing his sweaty curls.
"Ew, gross." Zayn scrunched his face up as he switched glances from Harry's hair and his black helmet.
"You wanted me to do this so that's your fault."
"Ugh, fine."
"Can I go home now?" Harry asked.
"No, you're coming to my place." Zayn smiled.
"When will this torture end?" Harry wailed.
"Oh shut up you love it."
