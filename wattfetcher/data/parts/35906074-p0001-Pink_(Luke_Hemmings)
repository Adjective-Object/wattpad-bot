Pink (Luke Hemmings) / Book 1 in the Color Coded Series:
Alaina Mace was an aspiring actress. She starred in films, TV shows, and still managed to continue an education in her teen years, making her an inspiration to everyone of all ages.
Luke Hemmings was a well known singer in a popular band that traveled across countries, stealing the hearts of girls that ranged from all ages and could make you drop on your knees in a flash.
With both fans and celebrities thinking they were a perfect match since they both had hearts of gold, they ended up meeting for the first time at a local coffee shop where they instead, clashed.
"Your hair looks stupid." He tells her, his jaw set firm as she purses her lips and smirks.
"I dyed it pink so I can look like a beautiful flower when in reality, I'm the bee you accidentally grab and get stung by whenever you try to pick it from the garden. And you Luke Hemmings, have grabbed the bee really fucking hard today."
