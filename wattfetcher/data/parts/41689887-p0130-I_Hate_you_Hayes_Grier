"No no no!" I start crying harder and try to unbuckle my seatbelt. "Keegan calm down what's wrong?" He asked, "Mom she's not moving." I cried harder, I feel the door open and I see Cameron.
He gets my seatbelt unbuckled, I go to moms side and she wasn't breathing, "No No No." I cry and start backing up, I start to cry harder and I felt someone's arms wrapped around me, I knew it was Hayes.
"She's dead!" I cried harder, Hayes hugged me tighter as I sobbed into his shirt, he carried me into the car and we soon got home with Cameron.
"Keegan look at me." Cameron said, "She's dead!" I say, "Shh, it's gonna be okay." he said, "No it's not, she's dead, Cameron." I say. Hayes carries me to my room and after crying I soon fall asleep.

"Keegan Keegan wake up!" Cameron said, I gasped, "Where's mom?" I asked quickly sitting up, "She's asleep why?" He asked, I pull my hair up in a messy bun ignoring his question.
"Keegan, why?" He asked, "We were on the way to Lucas's house and we were arguing and we got into a car accident, when I looked at her she was perfectly fine then I turned back and she was dead while I was on the phone with you and I stopped crying afterwards." I say, "You just had a nightmare it's okay baby." Hayes said.
I soon calmed down when Cameron came up with water. "I'm right here baby." Hayes said as my door shut, Take Your time started to play and Hayes tries to sing to me, I giggle.
"Good night baby girl." Hayes said, "Good night babe." I said, "I love you so much." Hayes kissed my forehead, "I love you much more." I said then cuddled with him.
I slowly drifted into a deep sleep.
