---CHAPTER VIII: Two More Seconds (Part 3)---
((Warning: Now that it is "HetaOni (Hetalia x Reader x 2P! Hetalia)", there will be swearing. Well, except from Oliver. Lol. The worst you can probably get from that cupcake-lover would be, "you butterscotch jerkface sassafrass " or something XD ...But he won't say that...in this chapter, that is. Also, there will be talk about blood, gore, killing, death and such. But hey, this is a HetaOni fic, you guys are probably prepared for that. Lol Okay, carry on~ You have been warned. Enjoy~))
=======================
//Reader's PoV!//
Darkness.
Where....am I...?
As I regained consciousness, I tried opening my eyes, but failed to do so. Am...am I blindfolded?
I tried moving, as well...but it looks like my arms and legs are tied together to...something... a chair...?
As I was recollecting my memories on what happened, I heard unfamiliar voices around me.
"So when the fuck are we going to get rid of them? My bat's aching to break their bones--especially that disgusting, hamburger retard's."
"Hush! Allen, I told you to watch your language! What if the poppet wakes up and hears you?"
"Tch. The dollface is out cold because a certain *someone* had to make her faint by trying to slice her cheek!"
"Shut up! She had to learn her lesson. You have no idea how irritating the ragazza was being."
"But what if the girl's scared of you now? How will you get her to go along with us, eh?"
"Heh. Don't worry I told her--"
"Hmm? You're awake now, da?"
I suddenly tensed up as I felt someone beside me to take off my blindfold.
It took me a while for my eyes to adjust to the light. When I did, I was met by crimson eyes. It was from a large man with grayish-brown hair, wearing an overcoat with a red trim...and what was noticeable about him was his red scarf.
I internally shivered upon realising...this must be...2P! Russia.
A few moments later, a strawberry-blonde haired man with sky blue eyes walked up to me and cheerfully spoke, "Good morning, poppet~ Nice to see you awake now! I missed you~"
"...Oliver..? ... Where...am I?" I asked softly, still trying to process what was happening.
"You're with us, dollface." a tan, redhaired man told me. He was wearing sunglasses, a bomber jacket, and a smirk whilst swinging his nail-covered bat at his side. 2P! America...
Suddenly, hands were placed on my shoulders. "Hmm... how long were you awake, ragazza?" It was that damn Italian Second Player. Now I remember! It was him. He was the last person I was with before losing consciousness. He must've brought me here.
"Just a few moments." I answered him.
He went to my right and faced me with a raised eyebrow. "I see. That's good~ Ah. Sorry about your cheek, by the way."
My eyes widened when I realised what he said. I remember he...pressed his switchblade on my cheek, giving it a little cut... It wasn't that painful, but of course, the shock of being harmed was enough for me to faint.
I wanted to move my hand to feel the cut on my cheek, but both of my hands were still tied to the armrest.
"...Untie me... It's not like it's possible for me to run away from you guys." I told them in a hopeless tone.
