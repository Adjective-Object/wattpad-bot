"Just finishing up before the concert." He said closing his laptop. "What's up?"
"I have to talk to you." I said, "You have all the right to be mad at me."
"What did you do?" He asked suspiciously.
"Its about the, uh interview."
"What about it?" He asked me.
"They asked about us."
"Really?" He asked smiling, "Well what did you tell them?"
"You have all the right to be mad at me." I said, "I told them y-you were nothing and unimportant. Which sounds really bad but I panicked."
"Are you fucking kidding me? So what? You don't want everyone to know we're dating? Is that it? Are you embarrassed of me?"
"No and I'm so sorry and you can be pissed at me because I'm an idiot. I panicked and I just don't want fans or someone getting in the way of us. It was stupid and I understand if you hate me and never want to see me again." I said, "I just really like you and I already fucked up."
Alan closed his eyes and sighed before opening them again, "I don't hate you. I'm just pissed." He finally said. "But thank you for at least telling me now instead of later."
"I'm still so sorry."
"You're a dumbass Aust, but I understand." He told me, "You didn't want something to happen from this or whatever and I get it.So it's fine, but next time someone asks you better be fucking honest and gloat about your hot and understanding boyfriend."
"I will. I'll tell them all about how great you are."
"You better, now come on." He said standing up, "Pierce is going on soon and we need to get to the venue."
"Okay, let's go."  I said and grabbed his hand.
"No, I'm still mad at you." He said taking hand from mine and grabbing his camera stuff from his bunk.
"But I said sorry!" I whined.
"Sorry doesn't fix it. Now since I'm still mad you can carry my stuff for me and if you drop anything I will kill you." He threatened.
"I won't drop anything." I promised.
"You better not." He said and started handing me different camera stuff.
"I don't want to make you mad again if this is my punishment."
"Good because next time you make me mad it will be much worse."
"Well I won't because I really like you and I want this to work."
"Good." He said as we started walking back to the venue.
"When will you not be mad at me?"
"I don't know."
I groaned.
"Oh hush, it's your fault now come on." He said walking inside.
"I know it's my fault."
Alan didn't say anything as he walked around taking pictures.
"Babe, you do realize that I go on next right?"
"Yep."
"Well can I go?"
"Hm... I don't know." He said going into a little section in front of the stage for press.
"But I need to, the guys are going to kill me."
