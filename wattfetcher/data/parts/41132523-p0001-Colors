Sometimes
I wonder...What would happen if I could turn back time Those failures, carelessness, words that didn't come out loud, chances that were left wasted
And...
Fights that were given up halfway.
If I could turn back time...Then maybe Just maybe
But
Even if I could turn back time, There is no guarantee that everything will be better this time...
And if I could change the past,Would all achievements and sweet memories that came with it also disappear?
"When one door closes, another opens; But we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we don't see the one that opened for us"-Alexander Graham Bell
All of these memories, regret and contentment, are what molds me in to the person I am now
And that alone,Is enough to make my life worthwhile.
