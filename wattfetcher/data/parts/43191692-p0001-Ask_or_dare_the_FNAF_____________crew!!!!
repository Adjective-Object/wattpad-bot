Hi there! Before we start doing this let me explain this book a little bit. First off these are Rebornica's versions of the characters cause I like the way they portray them.Second, let me introduce my OC characters to you!
Brittany: She is my main OC and one of the nightguards. She is weird and crazy, and likes everything and everyone! Physical appearance: She has blond hair and color changing eyes and is a neko with white cat ears and a tail.🐈
Sophia: She is Brittany's little sister and a OC waitress at Freddy's. She is silly and goofy and likes cleaning. Physical Appearance: She has brown hair and brown eyes.😝
(If you want to learn more about these two, please check my book "Fnaf Neko Nightguard.")
Thats about it, and there are no rules!
