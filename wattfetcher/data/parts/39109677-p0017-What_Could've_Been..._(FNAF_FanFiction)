I sighed as Freddy and Goldie left to gather their stuff. I guess I should prepare some rooms... I went up to the fourth floor, there was one floor above it, but I never went there. Unlike the rest of my house, which had a cozy-ish feel to it, even though it was so big, the fifth floor had almost no furnishings...It looked cold, empty.
I stopped in the hall that lead to my room, now to pick out a room for them...I wonder if they sleep in the same room or separate ones...
I pulled out my phone and set up a chat with just me and them.

Me: Hey, do you want me to pick one or two rooms for you guys?

Goldie: LORD LET IT BE TWO!

Freddy: YESSSSSS

Me: OK

Goldie: Hey, is it okay if we ALL sleep over tonight...I sorta bragged to Bonnie, Foxy and Chica... I didn't think that they had their phones though...Now they want to come over...üòÖ

Freddy: GOSH, YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

Me: It's okay, I have more than enough room.

Goldie: Really?

Me: YUP

Goldie: I'll add them in then!

Freddy: OH, no...

Bonnie: WHASUP?

Chica: R u sure it's okay for us to come over?

Me: YUP, wow, Bonnie.

Bonnie:?

Me: I quote, "WHASUP?"

Foxy: üòÇ

Chica: LMAO

Bonnie: ~Subject Change~ I swear I'm gonna go deaf from listening to my music

Goldie: I'll be there to teach you brailüòù

Me: Brail's for blind people, DORK!

Bonnie: I'm so confused...

Foxy: What's new?

Chica: LMAO
