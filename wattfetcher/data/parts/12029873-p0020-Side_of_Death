Nothing for me to do here. Savoring the last bit of the shade, I headed back out to Bryce. He was crouching on the ground, packing his medical supplies. My eyes suddenly caught attention to a figure coming out of the door.
"Hey, over here!" I started to yell. Then, I started to realize that the person was not a part of my group, and that he was headed straight toward Bryce. I panicked, trying to get to Bryce before the man could. No use! He's too fast. Pulling out one of my last shivs from the holster attatched to my boots, I aimed at the man. The shiv collided with the ground, sending sparks. He had dodged by rolling to the side, and that gave me more time, but he would still be at Bryce before me.
My last shiv, I whispered. Here goes nothing. Twirling it around my fingers to get the jist of it, I plotted my throw. He's just a couple yards away from Bryce, Astrid! Throw quick! Letting my mind command me, the blade whipped off my fingers and landed on the side of his throat. As if there were an invisible wall he had collided onto, he shot backwards, wrapping his hands around his neck. Bryce stayed there in shock.
"Erm..." Bryce stuttered, trembling. He was squatting on the floor, unsteadily. "Thanks, Astrid."
I failed to say anything, and nodded instead. Thankfully, Sterling ran out of the building, breaking the awkward silence of the near-death moment.
"Astrid!" She yelled.
I beckoned her over and gave her a tight squeeze on the shoulder.
"Who's left in there?" I asked.
"Just Joel, Kai and Skylar."
I didn't reply, but I intended to go back up there to rescue them.
"Astrid?" Sterling looked at me, knowing I was up to something. We had known each other for so long, we knew the look in each other's faces when we were plotting something.
Sure, she was more accurate, more sneaky and sly; but I was faster, so I shoved past her and headed back into the building.
