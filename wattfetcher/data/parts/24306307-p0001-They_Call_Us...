Luke Hemmings was you average student, he was okay at sports, he was popular enough and every girl in the school swooned over him. He didn't have a girlfriend but he didn't care he knew he could date any girl he wanted..... He just didn't want to.Chapter song: Teenagers- My Chemical Romance
Lukes P.O.V
I am your average teenager I get up, go to school, go to soccer training, go to band practise, do my homework (most of the time) and repeat.
So when my alarm woke me up at 7:30 on Monday the 1st of October I was hardly surprised. I got up and started getting ready for school trying to remember if I had any homework I hadn't done yet. I put on my Green Day shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans and black vans. My mom, Liz, had made me toast with vegemite on it so I ate it walking to school. By the time I got to school it was 8:15. I went straight to my locker where my best friends Michael Clifford and Ashton Irwin were waiting for me.
"Luke" Michael shouted across the hall "Ash says he saw a newbie in Mrs Dillons office" Michael said in a sarcastic tone
"I did Michael stop saying I didnt" Ash said back
"I believed you until you said he was Asian"
"Good morning to you guys too" I said but they completely ignored me they were too caught up in their argument over whether or not the newbie was Asian, if there even was a newbie. I got out my geography book and started to think about the fact that I am failing the class.
"Luke" Michael and Ash yelled
"What?"
"Are you going to stand there all day or are you going to come to class with us" Ash asked
As we headed to class Michael and Ashton were still fighting over the newbie every now and again I would nod or say "yeah" or "no"
We just got into the class before the bell rang and Michael and Ash took their seats at the back of the class room I went to sit in mine but there was someone already in it.
"See I told you the newbie was Asian" Ash said a little too loudly the whole class laughed and the new guy started to blush
"Mr Irwin Mr Clifford and Mr Hemmings sit down before I get Mrs Dillon" Mrs Hickey shouted at us
I sat down in the sit beside the new guy so that I didn't embarrass him even more.
"As Mr Irwin pointed out we have a new student to the school" Mrs Hickey began "Mr Hood if you would please introduce yourself to the class"
The newbie stood up "Hi I'm Calum, I am 15, I am from New Zealand and-"
"Ha Ash give me back my money he is not Asian he is a Kiwi" Michael shouted
"Mr Clifford I will not correct you again Mrs Hickey was getting more and more annoyed "Calum please continue"
Calum didn't look fazed by the interruption "and I like soccer and I play the bass guitar"
He sat back down but didn't even look up at me he just looked down at his geography book.
"Thank you Calum" Mrs Hickey continued on with the geography class as per usual.
30 minutes later the bell rang saying the class was over but before I could leave Mrs Hickey said "Mr Hood Mr Clifford Mr Irwin and Mr Hemmings stay behind please"
I packed up and made my way up to the front of the class so I was standing in front of her desk.
"Michael Ashton Luke apologise to Calum for embarrassing him in front of the entire class this morning"
