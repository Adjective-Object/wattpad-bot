"Hey Maybelle!" Luke said and gave me a hug. I hugged him back and looked at Ash who just smiled to me. What the fuck is he thinking about? I joined Harry and the boys to get our tickets. Luckily I was going to sit with Niall and Harry. This would be a perfect tour.. Three boys that likes me and me that have no idea what to do.. -at the plane-I layed my head on Harrys shoulder and I could feel so many eyes on me. It was kinda creepy, but it won't last long. I closed my eyes and not long after I fell asleep. It went a few hours and then Harry woke me up. "Baby, we're here" he said and smiled. I smiled back and went out of the plane with them.. He and Niall was going to a man to talk, idk about what but he told Liam and Luke to watch over mez. Why didn't he ask Louis? Does he know? I saw that Ashton was walking over to me and soon someone held both of my hands. Liam and Luke. They held my hands all the time till Harry got back. Then we walked to the hotel. It was beautiful and so much better than the last. We walked in, got our rooms and walked up. I was sharing room with Niall this time. Maybe a good idea.. I packed out my stuff and sat down on my side of the bed. We had to share, but that wasn't a thing we cared about. Niall said that we was all going out to eat so I had to dress nice. Like what nice? I got my bag and looked trough my clothes. Then I thought about the tight dress. I put it on and found my heels. Sexyyyyy.. I looked at myself in the mirror and this is the first time I'll ever say "I look great!". Now I was ready to go to that dinner with the boys. I lifted up Casey and Denny and walked down to meet them. The dogs was going to be in a dogpark at the hotel. "You ready?" Harry asked me when I gave the man the dogs. "Yes I guess" I said and took his hand. Then we walked out.
