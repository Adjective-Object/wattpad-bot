That needle you have, let it pierce me Rape the skin, fall under to sink low, below The skin that will hold it deep, deeper still Yes, that is how it goes here
Help me, soothe me I know you can't tear off my skin, off my skin But if you could, I would pay you in gold and diamonds
You could have all you wanted if you could take away my skin Transplant, transplant me Into the shell of someone I should be, someone not broken Someone reformed, yet blank enough to be manipulated from The inside out, pulled backwards
Morphine is what keeps me stable, stabilized enough to breathe Breathing only to drift away, floating in emptiness Because I am alone, despite those at my side No separating half, blue eyes not mine That needle you have, let it pierce me Rape the heart, fall under to sink low, beneath The muscle that will hold it deep, deeply still Yes, that is how it goes there Ignore me, remember me I know you won't tear it off, off between you two But if you could, I would pay you in love and matrimony You could have all you needed if you could take away that sin
