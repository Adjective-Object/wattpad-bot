Nothing came from her small stature. I cleared my throat debating if I should keep talking or not.
"Just pick yourself up and put everything behind you, because what happened, happened and you can't go back and change it so you have to get over it," I continue. "It will be okay, it will be great actually! I promise."
It was risky to state this promise, but for once I actually believed that it would get better for her. She's Olivia, everything goes good for Olivia.
She loosened her shoulders and breathed out a long, and shaky sigh. Her head came out from her hands; her eyes were red and puffy. She swallowed hard and proceed to lift up her sleeves of her hoodie.
There stood 3 faint scars. I couldn't believe it.
"He made you feel that unwanted, huh?" I took it cooly because I imagine she hadn't showed anyone this but me. She slowly nodded, fighting back more tears.
After a little comfortable silence she spoke, "Marcus, I promised myself that I'd never do that no matter what," she spoke softly almost a whisper. "That night, that was not me. I swear I was too drowned in my thoughts, my own thoughts were against me."
I felt this before myself, but decided to leave that part out.
"Well, you know what you gotta say to those people that make you feel that way?" I paused. "Say 'I don't give a fuck' because when you say it, u feel it."
Her lips slightly curled up into the smile that everyone loves. Then, realizing that I've done all I can, I stood up. I put out my hand for her to help her up. She hesitantly took it, her gentle hand chilled me with memories.
I nodded once and, this time, I walked away. I didn't turn back to see if she was smiling or if she walked away as well. But when I heard wet squeaky shoes I turned only to be greeted with a hug.
And that's when I realized where I stood with Olivia. She resembled my own child that needed my help and protection. She was like my pretend child before the real thing. Never again would me and her be the same.
