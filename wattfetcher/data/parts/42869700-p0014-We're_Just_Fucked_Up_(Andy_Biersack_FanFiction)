After that we kept training and learning new ways to kill a wolf.
We stopped at 10 pm so it was really dark out and we were sweating.
All of the sudden I hunched over holding my stomach and my head.
My eyes flashed and my fangs came out.
"Erin." I heard someone say that was all I heard before I collapsed on the ground.
------------------------------------
I woke up to voices yelling at each other.
"You have to tell her!" I heard someone say. I got up from the bed and slowly walked out of the bedroom to the living room where I heard the voices.
"I didnt know that this would happen." Someone grumbled. Andy.
"Its not your fault or hers no one told you guys about this." Ashley said.
What are they talking about.
"How am I supposed to tell her we're mates." What...mates...with...Andy....how.
I turned the corner and everyones attention went to me. Andy looked terrified and worried.
