"How does Morrowind sound?" Anson's inquiring voice broke through her reverie and Katya looked up sharply. "I mean, it's obviously not a prime location but the clientele is beginning to dry up here and I'm getting sick of this place."
The girl nodded, "I know what you mean. The Imperials look down on me because I am a Nord and the Thalmor look down on you because you're a Bosmer and on me because I'm a Nord. Not to mention Elenwyn and Loxias are always in the city. I hate feeling like a fugitive. Even if I am one." Here she grinned and shrugged. "Morrowind sounds fine. Besides, we'll be closer to Skyrim then. Maybe in a couple of years we can go home... I long to show you all of the wonders that my homeland holds. My family and I traveled all over the country because my father was a Stormcloak; my mother tended wounds and made food for the troops. There were a couple of other children in the camps and we used to play like we were soldiers too. I remember that the quartermaster carved me a wooden sword while we were camped in the Rift, the land there is beautiful, full of huge trees but its touching the hot springs of Eastmarch. I practiced with that sword until it splintered into pieces."
Anson smiled, "I'm looking forward to seeing it. "
"So am I... I just hope that it isn't far changed from what it was. After all, it's been nearly twelve years since I left."
"Come now Katya, twelve years isn't long. I'm sure it will be just as you remember leaving it."
Katya smiled, "I'm sure it will be changed in some ways, after all I'm not eight anymore."
"Well obviously. But Skyrim will still be Skyrim, cold, harsh and full of barbarians who dress in animal skins and follow forgotten traditions." Anson smirked.
"Are you calling me a barbarian?" Katya arched her eyebrows.
"Well. Yeah. A little bit."
"I'll show you a barbarian!" she jumped over the fire pit, ignoring her aching muscles and promptly began a scuffle with the elf. On account of empty stomachs and sore muscles, it didn't last long, both of them falling apart in the dust panting and laughing breathlessly.
"You're still a barbarian Kat. This just proves it."
"Oh shut up and fetch me some mead." She purposely thickened her accent as she sat up, brushing dust off of her clothes.
Obligingly Anson reached into his saddlebag and tossed a bottle of Nord mead over to her. Apparently the export of the stuff was not on the wane and as Katya twisted the cork out of her bottle and took a swig she knew why. It was the sweetest drink that could ever pass your lips, fragrant with honey and flowers but not heady and not bitter in the least. She finished her bottle off in a few chugs and then sat cross-legged in front of the fire as Anson began to roast a haunch of venison over the flames. After their decision to travel out of country she felt almost too excited to be hungry as she contemplated all that their trip could mean. They would be so much closer to her home. And then they would be in Skyrim itself; the Fatherland.

They were near the border of Morrowind; it was obvious by the dark clouds that were seemingly perpetual on the horizon and by the ash-and-fire smell that permeated the air, even here in the mountains.
"I don't think I'm going to like it here." Anson commented, his voice echoing back to her as they trod down the high and narrow mountain pass. The sounds of clopping hooves were doubly loud in the space.
"I think I agree with you." Replied the girl, already her throat burned from the acrid air and by nightfall the past two nights she had been left with a pounding headache from the smell. "Maybe we could just pass through the country and head straight on through to Skyrim? I'm sure we have enough gold saved up to buy a plot and put up some sort of stable. Even if we end up selling second-hand horses, which there'll be lots of with this insurrection going on."
