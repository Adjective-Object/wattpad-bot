I had a feeling this category would go by fast. Even though it was short this was a fun category to do. Anyway here are the results!
4: Princess Twilight
3: Princess Celestia
2: Princess Cadence
1: Princess Luna.
I kind of had a feeling Luna would win. And I do agree she is my personal favorite Princess! So Yay for Luna. Also sorry for pinkie_pie13 I know you really wanted Cadence to win. But hey she did make it to second place which isn't bad. Anyway so the next poll is gonna be THE KEY GIVERS! Basically the ponies who gave the mane 6 their key. So that ends this Chapter! Keep Calm And Be A Band Geek! Flute_player_1 out!
