I knew what that meant she had to break her phone... She's captured. I called Sly again but this time he actually answered "Hello?" He asked. "Sly a-are you okay? W-where are you?" I asked pacing the living room. "I'm at my house why? What wrong Dani?" He asked. Dani? "Can you give me your address I want to tell you in person." I replied. "Yeah okay" he said softly then gave me his address. I went to the garage and grabbed my keys (yes I had a vehicle but I never really drove it, it reminded me of my mom to much she used to love motorcycles just as I do now). I put on my helmet, put my phone in my pocket, started it up, and opened the garage I closed it behind me and drove to Sly's place quickly.

I heard a motorcycle drive up to me and Aleks' house. "Who's that?" He asked looking out the window. "Don't worry about it Aleks I know who it is I think..." I said not knowing that Dani had a bike but to be honest it suited her. I opened the door and there she was running to the door. I let her in and she took off the helmet. She looked to Aleks then to me. "Can I speak to you privately?" she asked panting. I nodded and we went up to my room. " I think those douches took Sherry... I tried to call her phone but the number was no longer available she must've broke her phone so they would know where I was... That what we always do when we're in trouble..." She said quickly pacing the room she looked flushed.. And sounded as if she's been crying but didn't look like it.
I hugged her she froze I heard and felt her heart beat which was going faster then the average hybrid's heart rate, breathing was quickened as well. Panic attack so she does have anxiety why would someone lie about that why did I think my own friend was lying? "Why did you ask if I'm okay and where I was?" I asked letting her go. She took a shaken inhale and let one out. And told me everything.
