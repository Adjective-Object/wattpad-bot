I gulped, realizing I sounded extremely pathetic at the moment. Awkward.
I cleared my head, and tried to change the topic. “Are you going to give me my phone back now?”
"No.” he said, equably. “I'm not going to give this phone to you until you do what I want." He got away from his locker and got up next to me, kneeling down in front of me, so he could lean in, very close to my face. "And you know what I want, Zoe?" His minty breath cooled my senses again, and I shut my eyes from our proximity. I could feel passionate fire coil inside me, and my heartbeat race fervently. I knew I needed to get away from him before I did something I would regret. He continued, in his deep, mesmerizing voice. "I want to fall in love. With you."
Oh God…
Suddenly, the minty air flew away just as my books pushed and scattered around again. I opened my eyes and saw him walk away, throwing his head back, laughing.
I scrunched up my nose in annoyance.

Jerk.
