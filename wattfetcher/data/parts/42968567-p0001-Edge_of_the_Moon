Okay, so I had two  ideas  for two different stories; one about a girl with sickle cell trying to be an ordinary teenager and the other two opposite people brought together by emails. So... me being me, I decided to put them together and hope for a good outcome. Â Now, the one about the girl with sickle cell is kind of autobiographical, since I was a baby I have had sickle cell (SS). It's basically when your red blood cell is shaped like a crescent moon or a sickle. This causes a lot of complications. I don't know why I decided to do a story about someone with sickle cell but I did. So... I hope you enjoy my two in one story. Some of the (sickle cell) situations in this book have actually happened to me and others have happened to other sickle cell patients I know and other are just things that could happen to sickle cell suffers.
