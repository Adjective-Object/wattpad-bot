Whenever I write a book, I usually try to use a cast that has worked together, so I can imagine them easier and so that it's easier to make a book trailer and so that my fans can have an easier time imagining them as well.
Saying that, I started writing Faith and creating Faith long before I started watching Glee and seeing the perfect cast it made for my book. Glee has nothing to do with my book except for the fact that I saw the cast and loved it for my book.

She refers to one of them (Brandt) as father, he's the more "masculine" of the two. In dialogue, she calls him "dad".
The other is Corey, who she refers to as dad. When in dialogue, she calls him "Daddy".

Beatrice was always seen as the perfect Christian girl. She had a boyfriend, a best friend, parents who loved her, a twin brother, and everyone loved her. That all changes on a night laced with drugs and Ian White.
Pregnant and afraid, Beatrice has to learn to have faith in not only herself and Ian, but in God as her life is thrown into chaos that she doesn't think she can handle.
