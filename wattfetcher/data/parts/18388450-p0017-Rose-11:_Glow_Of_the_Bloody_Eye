"Are they handsome?" A girl asked at giggled. What was funny about what she said? Some people laughed along with her, but I just didn't get the joke.
"The Royals are exceptionally beautiful, you would get so fascinated if you look at their eyes too long. Now enough with the appearance, let's get to the next part. The Royals are very demanding, whoever tries to not follow their command will be dead in no time."
"Did anyone dare to?" Someone asked. This time instead of just glancing, Dr.Ali looked at me firmly. "Not that I know of, but I think someone will soon. Who are the Royals will be studied in a history lesson and I don't teach you guys that." He looked away while changing the subject and started writing things on the board that we had to write too.
"Now, we will talk about the strongest and cleverest among our kind....." he sighed loudly as if he's going to regret what he's about to say, "....the half-blooded vampires."
And now I knew why he was so.
It didn't feel uncomfortable when they got to talk about themselves, it wasn't awkward since they have similarities, but what similarity do I share with them? Drinking blood? That what everyone in this place and that's why I am here so no point in stating the obvious. If that wasn't the only thing, I would have at wherever I am supposed to be, living peacefully even, but I don't think that's happening anytime soon.
