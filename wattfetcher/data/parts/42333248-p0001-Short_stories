Everyone has a soul mate. When someones soul mate dies, there vision turns black and white. I have lived my whole life in black and white. No one knows what happened. No on knows if my soul mate died when i was born, or if i was never supposed to have a soul mate. When i was younger, people used to tease me. They said that i shouldn't exist. Now, i agree. There is no purpose to my life if i don't have a soul mate. The bullying came to a point where i was going to commit suicide. But then this happened.
"Goodnight, sweetheart." Dad said as he closed the door. My mum left my Dad about 3 weeks after we were born. By 'We' i mean me and my twin sister. Wren. Wren was always the more popular one. She could see colors. "Night." I said. I couldn't get to sleep for ages. It was like my brain couldn't shut down. When i finally fell asleep, i had the strangest dream. I was falling through the sky. When i looked down, there was no ground. I fell through clouds and past many birds. When i looked down, i was about 6 meters away from the ground. It just came out of no where. I hit the ground. I woke up sweating. My heart was racing. Something was different. My anxiety suddenly woke up inside me. I managed to calm down before i had a panic attack. My world was no longer in black and white. I could see colors. "Wren!" I yelled. We both sheared a room together, so i didn't have to yell very loud. "Cath, it's 4am. What?" I didn't know if i should smile of cry. "I can see." "Of coarse you can see, you're not blind." "No, i mean, i can see colors." The biggest smile crossed Wren's face. "Really?! Oh my gosh!" She mad a strange squeal noise. I stood up and turned the light on. I looked in the mirror. "Wow." I whispered. Wren came over and hugged me from the side. For the first time in forever, i could see what i actually looked like. My hair was dark brown (Although i didn't know the names of the colors then.) My eyes were a very light blue, almost a silver. I always thought they were light grey. "You have to go tell Dad!" Wren yelled. "He's at work." I said. "Damn." We both sat on Wren's bed and watched TV. There wasn't anything on at 4am on a saturday. "Wow." I said again. I had never seen what a human's skin color was. Or hair color, or any color. "I wonder who your soul mate is." "Well, if i only started seeing colors today, my soul mate is 19 years younger then me." Wren laughed.
"Breaking news! Scientist found a frozen-over underground city. It looked completely abandoned, but scientists found a man, Frozen, in his bed. They have recently thawed him out, and he is currently in a coma. But still 100% Alive."
"Maybe that's your soul mate." Wren said. "Maybe. Does it show a picture of him?" I starred at the screen. "Omg, Cath!" "Omg. Omg omg omg." Wren squealed and i squealed, too. "He might not be my soul mate, though." "I know, but if he is..." We both squealed again. "Omg omg omg omg!" We were bouncing around the room. When we had finally calmed down, i looked at my phone. "Omg!" "I wonder how many times we've said 'wow' since we woke up?" i laughed. "What are you Omging about?" "My phone! It's in colour! My bed, It's in color! EVERYTHING IS IN COLOR!" Wren laughed. "It's amazing, isn't it. Knowing that your soul mate is out there." I nodded. "It is. It really is."
We didn't sleep for the rest of the morning. Dad came back at 8.47. "Dad!" Wren yelled. "Hey, girls. What's up?" Wren and i squeals for the fifth time that day. "What is it? The tension is killing me!""Cath can see!" Wren yelled. "What?!" "Yeah, i just woke up and BAM color!"i said."That's great!""I know, but it's weird now." "Why?" Dad asked."Because my soul mate is either I-don't-even-know years older than me, or is that freak-""HOTTIE!" Wren blurted out. I laughed."The hot freak, that got thawed out because he technically died almost 30 years ago." i explained."Which technically means that he's 51 not 21 if he's been dead for 30 years."Wren said. Dad laughed."Well, lets home it's the boy."We all laughed. Wren pulled out her phone."What are you doing?" Dad asked."Well, i though that i could google this guy, we could find out more about him." I pulled Wren back into our room. "It says here." Wren said. "His name is Levi." "Last name?" "Krumble." "Krumble? Levi Krumble?" Wren laughed. "Cather Krumble. It has a good ring to it." Cather is my full name, people just call me Cath. When my mum was pregnant, she didn't know she was going to gave twins. She couldn't be bothered to come up with two names, so she called me Cather, and my sister Wren. Get it? Cather-Wren? Katharine? "I like it." Wren laughed. "How old is this man anyway?" "I don't know, but he looks about 20." "Does it say what hospital he's in?" "No, but turn on the TV, maybe it's still on the news." I turned it on.
