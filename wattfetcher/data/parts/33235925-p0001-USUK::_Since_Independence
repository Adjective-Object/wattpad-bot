~-England's POV-Flash back~
He... He truly wants independence from me. I can see the determination in his eyes. I think as I have the boy I took in and raised so many years ago at gun point. My tears overflow and sobs escaped me as I collapsed into the mud. "I can't... I can't do it..." I wept as the now independent nation stood before me, watching me start my crumbling.
"What happened, England? I remember when you were once great." He wondered aloud before turning. Without a goodbye or a 'see ya later, Big Brother!', he then left.
America left me crying in the mud as rain felt like needles, even through my drenched clothing. I raised my hands, and stared at them, hardly able to see through the haze my tears created. "What... What did I do wrong? I-if you told me, i-i would have changed! I would have made it all better!" I shouted as if he was still standing in front of me. I glanced up to see his army cheering, not too far from where I am, but far enough to not hear what they're saying or to tell who from who. There was one soldier, though, who stood off to the side, just standing there. Instead of pondering further, I stumbled to my feet, whipped around, then ran.
