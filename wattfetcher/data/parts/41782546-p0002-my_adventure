We happened to be near a beach.i noticed fang acting quiet not unusual but I saw him arm tucked against his side. I asked him what that was but he just said "don't worry im fine " then suddenly he lost altitude fast I tapped Iggy's hand and then me and him swooped down and caught fang dropped him in the sand and I caught sight of something red
I looked down and saw blood!!!  And then with a pale face I unbuttoned fangs shirt and found a very unpleasant gash I screamed told the little kids to start cutting patches so I could cover the wound.then suddenly I had a blow to my mind and then  the voice started talking yes a voice(will tell more) and it said "
elivate his feet and put pressure" I asked the kids if the patches are ready they said almost then suddenly without question I kissed him just a short simple kiss but the kids were surrounding me luckly angel and gazzy we're gone to get the patches and a iggy is blind  but nudge still saw and fang oh I would never hear the end of it
Fangs POV
I was hurt bad by Ari Max's brother well half brother there was a gash at the side of my stomach Max was trying to see if the kids had ripped patches but then she leaned down and kissed me and for some reason I liked it she looked all embarrassed but got back to work and then everything suddenly started becoming blurry
Max POV
I was putting pressure on the wound and suddenly fangs eyes closed then we heard someone jogging towards us
I saw him and he saw us then had eyes went to fang who was murmuring quietly and he whipped out his phone I heard ringing and then an alarm blaring I looked up and saw a ambulance wow they sure did get here fast
