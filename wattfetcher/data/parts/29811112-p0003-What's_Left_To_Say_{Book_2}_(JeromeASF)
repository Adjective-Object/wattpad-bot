Hello everyone, and welcome to the first chapter of What's Left To Say! Woohoo!
What I want to do with this book is 1. Make the chapters longer because I'm getting more into the habit of making them longer and 2. Editing and fixing some things because my OCD won't allow such errors in my chapters, I'm just a grammar nazi, what can I say :P
I'm not sure when I'll update this, maybe once a week or once every two since I still want to make some changes to some things and stuff.
Let me just say I really do hope you guys like this book and continue on with the story of Ella-Mae and Jerome :D
This is a 1,394 word chapter excluding the authors note (I told you guys! A lot longer chapters!)
Any who, I'll see you guys all later :)
