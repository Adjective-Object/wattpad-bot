When we got home, I was in dire need of a shower. I took my time because it was probably the only moment I'll ever had to myself. I stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around my body. I proceeded to my room and dug around in my drawers for clean clothes. Sweat pants and a t-shirt it is.
I walked past my window, forgetting about my curtains being opened. I haven't dropped my towel, so far no need to hide in my closet for the rest of my life. I took the chance to glance at Jack's window without thinking twice about it. He popped into view a few moments later and had that same look on his face. Like he wants to pull his hair out. Or maybe that's just his face. Maybe he's just constantly annoyed.
All he did was snatch a book from his shelf and plop down on his bed. He ran a hand through his hair and threw the book aside. He lowered his face in his hands and I couldn't look away. I do realize he's going through a lot right now, but it's nothing he didn't bring on himself.
I blocked my thoughts and I started to close my curtains. But before my view was cut off, I caught Jack's glance in my direction.

Filler chapter, but hey, at least it's something, haha. All stories need development, and I don't want to rush this. Sorry it took so long to update, I finally got a new computer so hopefully updates will be coming sooner!!
Hope you have a good week, and thanks for all the positive feedback. :)
