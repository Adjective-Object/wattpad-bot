Simon's POV :
Of course I wasn't going to tell Karam about anything, I just didn't want her to go to Jake's house because I clearly knew his plans.
Only if she knew ... Only if she knew how much watching her leaning to Jake's side hurts me, only if she knew how walking out of her house like a Jerk after that night out of her house, the night that will make me a father in few months. I've always dreamed of the both of us, Me and Leena, running around, hand in hand, don't call me cheesy because ... for the first time, I felt love. I didn't feek physically attracted to her as much as I was attrackted to her personality, her thoughts, her brain and her everything.
I had been hiding my knowledge about Molly's and Tom's religion, I clearly knew that Molly had become muslim, I just didn't find a reason to prevent her, neither to punish her, I did actually not like that much, and I was about to talk to her about it and have a little fight over it, but then ... Then Leena came.
The day I saw shiness in her eyes,  modesty in her clothes and her attitude. She was one in a million. I didn't like her, I just didn't hate her like everybody did, I mean, why should I hate somebody who is nice, smart and doesn't appear half naked like others? Just because she has a different religon? This stupid reason is not enogh.
When I saw Leena, I realized that following Islam is not a bad thing, it might be the best but that doesn't mean that I want to follow it either. When I saw the confidence the was walking in, how her head was heald high but her eyes weren't all over the boys, when I saw her fighting back those who were killing her with their poisoned words, I believed that this religion gives you power, that this religon is worth fighting for, if not, why would she even fight? Why would she stick to her long loose clothes while she clearly didn't have a bad body at all? Why would she come to school without makeup to impress the guys like other girls do? I didn't get the full answer to all of my questions because I never asked. But, what I was sure about was that there must be something that will be given to her, a prize, maybe heaven? Is heaven even real? Maybe !
When I saw Islam in Leena's attitude, I knew that if my sister followed it, she'd become a better person, not one of the people that media keeps showing.
The day I wanted to save her when Peter and Tom did the prank in my house, that was the day I knew that Leena won't just cross my life smoothly, her laugh when I was helping her finish her job, the day I surprised her and planned her a birthday party, I saw happiness in her eyes, I was completely happy, and when we went to the park together, the fun we had and the jokes we said, I knew that what I had done would make us friends, but I had never thought that we'd reach what we had reached.
When she threw the cup of coffee over me, I felt angry, I wasn't the guy to mess with, but I couldn't hurt her back, instead, I acter more hurt than I already was, my first confession is : When Leena came to my house to help me with my homework after burning me, I dropped the plate of cake on the ground on porpose, I wanted her beside me, to take care of me.
The day she brought the sheep and called me, when she wiped her bloody hands in my shirt, when she ran away giggling,I felt Damon getting jealous, that's why I kept my mouth shut, I didn't want to ruin our friendship.
When I followed her to the orphanage, I saw how caring she was, how much hidden feelings and rough memories she had. When I first hugged her ... No words can ever describe what I felt. And when I followed her and heard Damon saying what happened and how her parents got the hospital, flames started jumping out of my eyes, I wanted to kill him for doing it. Whe  Leena hugged me and cried into my chest, for the first time ... I felt her weakness, and it was the worst feeling I've ever felt so far.
Day by day we got closer, but she started changing, her look, her attitude and everything, I was trying to make her feel better but I wish I didn't. The day she told me she loved me, I couldn't believe myself, what I had wanted since the day I fell for her finally happened, but in the wrong time and wrong place.
