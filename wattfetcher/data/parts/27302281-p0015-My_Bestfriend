" woah what happened " the girls asked as chaz and Ryan tried to get Justin off Alex
" hold on Justin baby calm down " I said touching his shoulder then I felt his heartbeat slow down and he released. Alex from his grip when chaz and Ryan dragged unconscious alex away from Justin
" baby calm down ok I'm fine now " I said pecking him on the lips
" good " I said
" can I talk to Justin for a minute" chaz and Ryan asked
" uh yeah " I said walking off
Justin POV
" what did he even say to you that pissed you off that bad " chaz asked looking over at alex sprawled across the floor
" that I better watch my girl because she will end up screaming his name instead of mine "
I said balling up my fist. Wanting to hit him some more
" calm down Justin " a voice said behide me that sounded like an angel I turned around and saw. Kylie staring at me like I was about to explode. Was she scared of me now ?
