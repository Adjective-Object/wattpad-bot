At the doors of the x-factor studio, Harry was waiting in a big line of  singers, actors,  dancers and such.

*Harry's P.O.V*
I  accidently bumped into someone. "So-" I get interrupted by him. "Watch where your going  curly!" I chuckled at that. "What's so funny eh?!"  He looks up at me. "Curly? You don't have any other  names for me, eh?" I say.  The short boy growled, "Just- Don't think we'll EVER be friends alright?" He shouts, I nodded.. "Good."  'He seems so innocent, what kinda innocent boy like them have with  a rude personality?' I thought. When someone walks next to the short boy, his mood immediently changed into a happy mood.  'Well, he has mood swings. He could be bipolar.'   My name gets called and I don't hear since i'm  deep in my thoughts "HARRY STYLES?!" I hear her scream. "Here!" I walk up to her and she gives me my nametag and I walk away putting it on me. "Put it on and take a seat, anywhere intill someone calls your name." I nod and sit by her. "Louis Tomlinson!" I hear the same short boys voice shout "Here don't scream at me lady or you'll deal with me!" He says angrily, he grabs his nametag and walks away. "Calm down Louis' just  breathe calmly." And Louis did  so, Louis looks over at me and sits down by me.

"Hey curly." He says in a better mood. I get confused for a second. I just wave at him. I know I have a crush on him now cause  the way he looks.  I look bad. All I got is  skinny jeans and a shirt that said. "I don't talk much ^." The arrow shows me. I get lost in my thoughts of him. "CURLY!!?" He shouts snapping his fingers  in front of my face. "I said, what's your name?" I point at my nametag. "Harry?" I nod "Yeah." He stares at it.  "Haha that's sorta silly, don't you think?" Louis says teasingly. "Uhm. What's--" I get interrupted by a guy named Liam. "Hey Louis." He sits next to him. "Hi Liam." Louis says back, "So your name's Louis, eh?" I ask, Louis looks back at me. "Yeah it's not as stupid as the name Harry." He says,  meanly.   I get reminded of everything people said to me in school saying 'Harry's a stupid name, who gave you that name anyway? They must've been drunk when they named you!' And 'Your so stupid go away nobody likes you! You freak!'  I cover my ears and close my eyes tightly, whispering. "I'm a freak, i'm a freak."   Louis notices, his mood changes. He looks like he's worried. "What's wrong Harry?" He says, I don't answer. "I've seen this before, this boy must have AD!"  Liam says. "What's AD?"  Louis asks, I can hear them but I keep whispering, "I'm a freak.. I'm a freak."  and breathing heavily. "Asperger syndrome, he's having an episode!"  Louis gasps. "It must've been something I said." Liam  thinks of what to do then Zayn comes up "What's wrong with Harry?!" Zayn  says. "He's having an episode." Liam says. "It was something I said."   Zayn gasps. "What did you say to him?" I hear Louis sigh. "Yeah it's not as stupid as the name Harry, is what I said." Zayn gasps louder. "When we were in 2nd grade people were bullying him saying his name was stupid and bad." Louis gasps too. "Well I didn't know!"

I  keep whispering "I'm a freak, i'm a freak!"  Zayn  hugs me tightly. "Sssh, Harry. Your not a freak. Your name is beautiful  and don't let people tell you different." I start to calm down a bit. Getting exhausted. "Sssh, Harry. Just go to sleep.."  I fall asleep in Zayn's arms. "He'll be sleeping for atleast one hour"  Zayn says. "Louis Tomlinson."  A person calls. "Coming!" I hear Louis say. I wake up an hour later in Zayn's arms. I yawn lightly. "W-What happened?" I said confused. "You had another one of your episodes." Zayn says. "Aww.." I groaned. "I'm still tired."


After  their auditions.

"Hey Harry." I hear a familiar voice call while Zayn was walking me home. "Yes I answer back?" I notice the shorter boy, Louis there. "Sorry for earlier, I wanted to make it up for it by hanging out with you saturday, if  we don't got  x-factor of course." I had a friend beside me we just met. Named Niall he was going to hang out tonight. So I nod. "Sure Louis. And it's fine." Louis pats my cheek. "Bye curly." He turns around and leaves.  "Let's go boys." I say to Zayn and Niall we get to my house. Which my family was rich. We don't got much of a mansion but it's half a mansion. Niall was surprised but Zayn wasn't we spent the night playing video games intill we fell asleep.
