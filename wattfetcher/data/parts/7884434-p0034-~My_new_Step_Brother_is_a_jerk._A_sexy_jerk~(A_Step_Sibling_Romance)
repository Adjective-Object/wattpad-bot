Chapter 12: Shea's P.O.V
I stand there holding Casper as he holds me. His embrace warms me and I calm a bit in his arms. He kisses the top of my head and I hug him tighter.
"Thanks Casper" I say softly. "I really needed this. You have no idea."
"Shea its my pleasure, I hate seeing a beautiful girl upset. Im here okay?" He says softly in my ear.
I nod and just hold onto him. We stand there for a couple more minutes till I pull away. I look up at his face and then his eyes. They are full of concern and worry and I think for a minute. Maybe he does care.
"You wanna go out tonight Shea? To get your mind of things?" He says rubbing my upper shoulders and smiling at me. I smile softly back and I nod agreeing.
"Yeah what time?" I say looking in his gorgeous eyes.
"I'll pick you up at 8 okay?" He says grabbing my hand in his.
"Okay it sounds good" I smile and he winks and brings my hand up a to his mouth and kisses my knuckles soft. He drops my hand and he backs away. He winks and turns around walking to his car. I stand there for a minute and think of what the hell I just did.
I pull up to the house, Seth sitting on the front steps. I roll my eyes and I walk up to the house and he opens his mouth to say something right as I slip past him and into the house.
I look at my watch and see the time. 5:30 I have enough time to get ready. I go upstairs and I get in the bathroom and I turn on the shower. I walk out to grab a towel and I stop dead in my tracts. Across the hall is Seths room, his door wide open. Hes standing there half naked, with Ashley, half naked. She spots me and smirks. Seth turns around and his face kinda drops. I hold back the tears in my eyes and I smile at him. I walk to the closet in the hall and grab one and make my way back to the bathroom.
I hop in the shower and I clean up and hurry out. I leave the bathroom with a towel on and I see Seth sitting on his bed, Ashley laying down. That was a fast fuck.
He looks up at me with hurt in his eyes and I ignore it. I walk to my room and I go to my closet and start to look for clothes. I hear a small knock on my door and I go over and open it. I look down seeing Lisa there.
"Lisa, Hey" I say wrapping my towel around me better.
"Hey Shea so uhm what was all that this morning?" She asks quietly
"Lisa its nothing important, just silly teenager stuff"
"Tell me Shea"
"Seth cheated on me okay!? Now please just leave me alone!" I say pushing her gently out of my room and closing the door and locking it. I felt bad but I just didn't think she needed to know about this kind of stuff.
I go back to my closet and pull out a pair of white skinny jeans, a black flowy top, and my black heals. I put it all on and I go into the bathroom and begin to do my hair. I blow dry it and then strighten it. My long brown hair reaching my.
I grab my makeup bag and I start to apply foundation, eyeliner, blush, mascara. I finish and look at my results. I smile atmyself in the mirror and I grab my phone off the charger and look at the time. 7:45. 15 minutes to spare.
I walk out into the hallway and I walk down into the kitchen. Seth is standing there and he looks at me. I look back and I see his eyes widen.
"Where are you going?" He asks
"Out" I say plainly
"With who!?" He asks me.
