I woke up on my own time, which was normally around ten or eleven thirty in the morning, since it was the middle of June and school was out.
I managed to drag myself out of bed, and downstairs to greet my family for breakfast. My mother was curled up on the couch with a blanket and a cup of coffee. I walked over, and sat on the couch with her.
"Morning." I said, and she brought her attention to me with a smile.
"Morning, happy birthday Madi." She hugged me tightly, making me smile. "Here." She handed me a stack cards. I tore open the first envelope, and was rather shocked to find the card inside was from my father.
My dad left us when him and my mother got into an argument about God knows what. I was only five at the time. We've never heard from him since then, which frankly isn't a bad thing. I have learned to not care for him, not that that's the right choice. I tossed the card aside, and moved onto the next one from my mother.
"Thanks mom." I smiled at her, and she smiled back. I moved into the next card. Shock came over me as I stared blankly at the handwriting on the envelope. It was just as I remembered it, never changed since fifth grade. I swallowed hard as I ripped the envelope open, and pulled out the piece of lined paper inside.
Madi,
Are you seriously sixteen?! That's crazy! Last time I saw you, you were just ten years old. I guess that would make it six years we haven't seen each other, huh? Hopefully we can get together soon. Happy birthday! I love and miss you! -Shawn
I felt a year roll down my cheek as I kept my eyes trained on the letter in my hands.
Shawn was my best friend up to fifth grade, when he moved to Toranto. He's been all I thought about for years, unless I was lucky enough to forget about him for a day or two. I was devastated when he left.
"Madi, what's wrong?" Mom asked, looking at me with pure worry. I sniffed.
"I-it's from Shawn." I stuttered, handing her the letter. She skimmed it, and handed it back to me sadly.
"I'm sorry, Madi." She said sadly. I shrugged, wiping a few tears away.
"Whatever. I-it doesn't matter. I'm gonna go get dressed." I took the letter from her, leaving everything else downstairs and ran up to my bedroom, where I changed into some fresh clothes for the day, and put on some makeup. I could already tell today wasn't going to be an easy day, and something was going to happen rather quickly.
Hey guys!!!
So, I've decided I was going to re-write Falling, because the original absolutely sucked ass! I hope you all enjoy this one a little more than the old one, or just the same if you like the old one too, haha.
Love you all!-Madison
