"Aw, the couple had to part ways." Wes teased mocking a sad face. I turned glaring at him. She's just a friend man, chill. She at least has manners and doesn't act like a complete ass. Wes out a hand to his chest, mocking an "in pain" gesture. "Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never break me." he smirked. I rolled my eyes and shoved past him. "Hey!" he called and pinned me against the wall. His face was in close proximity to mine, his hard different colored paradoxes on mine. I tightened my jaw and grew pink as I got a clearer view on his features. He had freckles, that were widespread all around the top of his cheeks. There was one lone freckle near his jaw, well a beauty mark I think. His skin was really clear now that it was close up. And his eyes, one golden brown and the other a warm chocolate brown were really bright, and were framed by long think lashes...and a glare. "Watch what you say, Stone."  he warned, his voice low and entrancing. I barely gasped, as I felt my chest burning. Why am I feeling this weird warm thing in my chest and some uncomfortable twist on my stomach? What the hell is this? It was so weird this feeling and toward Wes of all people. A guy! A guy who hates the living shit out of me.
I could've sworn seeing Wes lose the hate in his eyes and actually look at me, his eyes intent on mine. And I swear, after looking at me for a moment, his face had inched closer to mine. I pressed the back of my head against the wall, part of me wanting him to lean the rest of the way in and the other half wanting to push him the hell away. I was so conflicted it wasn't even funny. He seemed to pause, the hate back in his eyes. "Got it?" he whispered darkly. I slowly nodded. He let go rather roughly before storming off to his room and slamming the door leaving me there frozen. I hadn't noticed I had held my breath, so I quickly let out the air.
I never really thought about my sexuality. I mean for the majority of my life I had 0 interest in others and firstly didn't even like people to begin with. Was I attracted to guys? No not even that...was I attracted to Wes of all people? I didn't know. I quickly shook my head from the thoughts, and went up to my room slowly, hoping to clear my mind with piano. I entered the room and went straight to my piano and began playing Mozart.
For the first time ever, the sound of keys didn't soothe me.
