Ice finally entered the shop and went to where I was. He sat at the chair opposite to me and stared at me like there was something on my face.
“Can you stop doing that?”
“What? I just find you so cute!”
“W-what? P-please? Can we just get this over with?”
“Okay, okay!” He stopped looking at me and faced the counter. “Golf!” He called the shop’s waiter. So, that’s his name.
“Just a minute.” Golf replied as he prepared his things.
After three minutes, he went to us with just a notebook and pen in-hand. I mean, he doesn’t have a Menu where I can choose something to order. Is this one of those shops where they can cook and server anything you want? No, even the most luxurious of restaurants have a menu to help customers choose what to eat.
“Hello, good morning!” Golf looked at me and smiled. “Is it the same order or do you want a menu?”
“Uhm… You might have mistaken me for someone else. This is the first time I’ve been here.”
“Yes, Golf. Just the usual.” I gave him a confused look. He noticed this and quickly changed what he said. “Just the usual stuff I order here. And yes, a menu for my date.”
“W-what d-d-date?” I was surprised by Ice’s sudden announcement. I turned to face Golf and he gave me this understanding look. “No, you’re getting the wrong idea. We’re not… you know… I’m not…”
“I understand, don’t worry.” Golf gave me another smile before leaving.
“Are you out of your mind Ice?”
“Well, aren’t we on our first date?”
Are you kidding me?
