"It's getting late" Tom sighed and I did too
"You know Damon" Maybe he knows his house, which is now kinda mine too
"Hell yeah, He's my best friend. plus, he runs the BEST parties ... why" He frowned
"I Live with him" I sighed, Tom's jaw dropped, Oh god ! that sounded improper.
"No No, not with him with him, Ugghhhh long story" I explained
"Come on, you should walk faster if you want to arrive there before Ishaa' prayer" His eyed widened and he covered his mouth.
"Ishaa' prayer? you know about Islam ha ?" I was surprised
"uh I heard you talking about it yesterday umm, come on, it's not far" he stumbled then started to walk fast.
I didn't mention anything about Islam or prayers in school ... whatever, just let it go Leena.
