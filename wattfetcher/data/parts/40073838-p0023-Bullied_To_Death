Corey went in first since he was immediate family. I stared at my fisted hands. I led her to this. To her death.
After Corey, Wil went in. I cried a little harder. I was going last so I silently face palmed myself for doing this to her, my one and only.
"River," Wil called. I looked up slowly, my eyes bloodshot. "You can see her now." I stood up, hunched over, and walked in.
There, I saw Mallory pale and stiff. Her eyes were closed and her used-to-be smile was now a thin, straight line. I sat next to her and held her hand, her ice cold hand.
"I'm sorry." I sniffed. "I'm sorry I led you to this. It was all my fault and I would've never wanted this to happen to you, to me, to us. I love you...with all my heart and I'll never forget you. You're my one and only, Mallory. You know that." I kissed the cold skin on her forehead and let go of her hand, walking out.
I slumped back down in the chair I was previously in and took out the now crumpled note from my pocket. I opened it and read:
River,I thought you loved me. I really did.
I want you to move to LA and make new movies. I know you love acting. I want you to audition for the film, Mosquito Coast. You'll love it, I can tell.
I want you to die in LA. Grow old and die there. That's what I would do.
~Mallory
I closed the piece of paper and put it back in my pocket. I took out my notebook that I write my songs in and started writing down my story...of Mallory.
