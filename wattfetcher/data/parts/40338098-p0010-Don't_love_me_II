I can't hear them so good right now, but I walked closer and closer. I had to stop behind a wall so they couldn't see me. "Fucking listen to me Irwin! She doesn't like you anymore! You broke her heart.. Go kill yourself" That was the worst I ever heard Harry say! How could he do that to him! I was pissed so I walked over to them and looked Harry dead in the eyes. Then.. I slapped him. "Fuck you Styles.. Grow up!" Then I left. I knew that I actually protected Ashton, but I don't care. Harry was a total jerk and should never have said that to him! I walked up again to my room and sat down on the bed. My phone beeped and I saw that it was a text from Ash. "Hey! Thank you for what you did, but you didn't have to.. Sorry for that I broke your heart. I love you" I still didn't answer him, but I thought about that I could meet up with him later. Harry couldn't know about that, but I was going to tell Liam so he could be close to me and be there if something happend.. I changed into some more comfy clothes when Niall got in. I was just in some sweatpants and my bra... "Omg! I'm sorry" he said and shut his eyes. "No it's okay" I said and smiled. I didn't care who saw me.. It's boobs, fat on my chest.. Woooo.. I texted Ash and Liam. Liam was going to hide in the park and I and Ash was meeting up not far away. "Meeting someone? You look beautiful" Niall said and smiled. "Yea.. Ash" I said and looked down on the floor. Niall was in shock. I totally understand it but I need to do this and get over it.. Sooner is better, right? -30 minutes later-I was sitting in the park with Ashton talking about last time. I told him the truth and said that he broke me totally and that I don't like him like that anymore. "Can we be friends tho?" He asked me worried. I wanted to give him a second chance so I of course said yes.
