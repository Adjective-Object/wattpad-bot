I walk into the bathroom and washed my face. I looked up at the mirror and saw nothing as usual. I walked out to find Andy relaxing on the bed.
"Im going to go for a walk." I annouce. He looked over at me and smiled.
"Would you like me to join you?" He asked me. I shook my head and left the room. I walk out of the house and just wonder around until i bump into Kellin. He looks a little confused and looks around.
"How come Andy isnt with you?" He asks.
"Hes resting." I say.
"I would be shocked if your mate wasn't tired. No one has ever beaten my leader before. So I won't touch you in any naughty way. I'll hug but nothing more." Kellin says. I nod my head and turn to walk away from him.
"Please don't cheat on him miss. He's an honorable man and is kind to you. I can tell just by how willing he is to protect you. Everyone who has battled my leader came back in defeat or died."
"Im never going to cheat on him." I reassure him and I walk back to the room. As I near the house i get a funny feeling. I look around and keep walking. I keep walking till i see a shadow and my finacè walks out towards me.
"What are you doing here?" I say shocked. He smirks and keeps walking towards me.
"Your my fiancèè and im saving you from him. CC told me about him kidnapping you." He said. I looked over to the house. He cups my face with his hands and looks me in the eye. A car pulls up close by and stops.
"Im taking you away." He says as a sword appears by his neck.
"No your not." Andy says. Ashley turns to face him. He kicks Andy away and grabs me. He takes a knife to my throat and slowly backs away. Kellin jumps the car in wolf form and knocks Ashley away. I fall to the ground as Ashley gets up and runs to his car.
"Take her then." He shouts back. He gets in the car and takes off.
