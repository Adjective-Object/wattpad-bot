a / n this is kinda sad, read at your own risk.
The worst type of crying is the silent one. The one when everyone is asleep. The one where you feel your throat getting tight and your eyes becoming blurry from the tears. The one where you just want to scream. The one where you have to grab your stomach and cover your mouth to keep quiet and not let the sobs escape. The one where it gets harder to breathe for you. The one in which you bury your face in the pillows so your parents or your siblings sleeping next door couldn't hear you. The worst kind of crying was something Abrielle knew too well. It was the one kind she was most familiar with. It was something she had done silently, in the dark so no one could know.
