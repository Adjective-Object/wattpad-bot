Natasha ran through the mysterious forest. "RUN MEGANA, HURRY!" Yelled Natasha. "help!! I cant, my foot is stuck!" Screamed Megana. Anyal ran to Megana. "HERE! Let me help you!" Anyal pulled Megana hard. "HURRY ITS AFTER YOU!" Cried Natasha. The Beast ran closer. Megana took a glance back, "JUSTIN RUN!" screamed Megana. Just as Justin was about to take a big sprint, it grabbed him. "Ahhh! HELP!" Cried Justin as the beast snatched him. Seamus swung from the high ropes. Tree to tree he leaped. "Hang in there Justin!" Panickly he said. Just as about he was going to pounce on the beast. It slapped his face. Seamus fell to the ground. Justin slipped out of its hand. Natasha and the others stopped. "No....no...no!" Cried Natasha as she ran to Seamus. Anyal and Megana ran as fast as they could to Justin. "Justin....please, dont do this!" Whispered Megana. Anyal held Justin. "Please, stay! Dont leave us!" Softly said Anyal. A tear gently flowed down her cheek. Megana kneeled there in shock. It was silent for a few seconds. "NOOOOOO!" Anyal put her head up facing the sky, crying in despair. Megana looked up. "Anyal.....LOOK BEHIND YOU!" "What?" Said Anyal just as she was about to turn back. There it stood. Both girls kneeled down in shock.
