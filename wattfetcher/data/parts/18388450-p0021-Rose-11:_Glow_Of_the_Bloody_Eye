"What were they?" I asked.
"Pass or die." he mumbled.
My eyes were as wide as saucers. How could someone so heartless?
"What do you mean pass or die?"
"The rules were simple, really. We work in pairs and I was with Marcus. One has to hunt, the other has to fight what's hunted. I was supposed to hunt. He was supposed to fight."
"Hunt and fight what?"
"The same as now, Marcus had to fight thirsty-blooded vampires. However, I had to hunt .....a human."
I laughed. "Tell me you're lying, Please tell me you're lying." my laughter was exchanged with a frown.
But he didn't stop.
"They chose for me a random person to find and turn into a thirsty-blooded. The person was a girl-" Roby was still gazing at the moon and didn't glance at me."
"Stop." I whispered.
"Black hair."
"Please stop."
"Blue eyes,-" he was talking fast. His eyes were getting wet. "pale skin, lives in England and this girl killed my best friend!" he finally broke down.
"And-"
"Don't say it!" I snapped. I placed  my hands on my ears not wanting to hear anymore.
"This girl-"
"No." I whispered, I was already feeling dizzy and felt like i was going to fall off. I was shaking my head and already on my feet. i closed my eyes to stop the tears. This was all too much to stand.
"Is right in front of me."
"NO!"
