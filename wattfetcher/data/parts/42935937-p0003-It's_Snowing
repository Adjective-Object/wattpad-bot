When I arrive at school the next day everyone is super excited one because it's the last day of school and two because I always have the BEST end of school party and three because all the guys were totally LOVING Melissa's new look. (Thanks to me and Maddy). I walked up to my friends Beatrice (we call her B.) was talking to Melissa and Maddy. About 5 minutes after I took my bag to my locker it was time to go to my classes. All day I was waiting then finally when I was in my English class talking Jay  I got a text from Melissa. "We are going to ur end of school party together!!" I read. Jay and Quentin are on the same soccer team so they are really good friends. Somehow we got talking about who we were going with to my end of school party. "Hey so I know it's a bit late" jay said while leaning on his desk "but would you by any chance want to go to your end of school party with me?" Omg I was speechless. Like seriously. "Omg yes of course jay. I would love too." I said after I finally found words. After class was over I ran over to my friends to tell them everything.
