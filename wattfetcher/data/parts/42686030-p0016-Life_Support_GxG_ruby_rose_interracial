Natasha POV
I walked back to the bed after washing and brushing my teeth. I sat down and the doctor walked in " oh wow your woke?" I nodded and looked at him " yes. So when can I leave?" The doctor walked to me " soon...But has your girlfriend told you the news?" I shook my head confused "umm...what news?"" your pregnant. " I laughed " very funny. I can't be pregnant I've never been with a guy. So I know that's not it. " he stared at me before showing me a sonogram 'your a month pregnant." I shook my head ' B-but how?" He pulled out a diagram. I see he was ready to explain ' ruby has sperm mixed with her female fluids. So when you two....interact and they Mix together going inside you. You end up pregnant." I blinked trying to process this. So this is why she ran out? Wow....Right when I need her most. I rubbed my stomach smiling slightly. 'Atleast I have you.'
Ruby POV
I heard the doctor explain everything and I'm just waiting for the time to walk in and talk to tash. I'm not leaving my future wife and child. Not ever. I just hope she's not mad at me for bailing
