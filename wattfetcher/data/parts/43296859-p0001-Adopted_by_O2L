Emma's pov Now Mary's sunshine orphan house isn't very sunshiny. Most of the older girls which include me , my best friend Margo , and the hated witch girl who calls herself vapor all get ignored and abused by ms Mary , but all the younger get treated like Angels. " Hey u three get ur butts ready now!!" Ms Mary screamed from down the hall way, then added "LOOK PRESENTABLE I DONT NEED NO BAD TALK ABOUT THIS PLACE AND DONT U DARE MENTION HOW U GET TREATED AROUND HERE" I got up and slipped on a pair of high waisted shorts and a faded away crop top with pineapples all over it and slipped on my white shoes which are no longer white , brushed out my long hair and went down stairs to the main floor. 6 guys walked in, all looked completely different from each other.
Connor's Pov As I walked in to this orphan place with the guys behind me I got a rush of happiness, I'm finally adopting. Immediately my eyes caught on a girl with long hair and a faded away pineapple shirt. I walked over to the front lady at the desk. " Hi, I'm Connor and I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 13-14" She said in a deep voice that I wasn't expecting," ok I'll go get the three girls"Soon she came back with the three girls and one was the one I caught my eyes on earlier. We all sat down in a room. The first girl who came in was a bit scary and was a little to obsessed with black and was convinced she was a witch. The second was a little too girly. Finally the girl I saw walked in. " So what kind of things do u like" I asked her."Umm well I love Arizona and coffee, I spend a lot of time on the Internet. I've always wanted to learn and have a penny board." She replied.OMG i already loved her.She walked out and the deep voiced lady came in. " We would like to adopt the last one" "Emma?! You want to adopt her?!" She replied surprised.
"yes I want her and only her"
