"Sounds perfect." I said a little too excited.
He kissed me again, like before when we were on the side of the road. It was passionate. He pulled away smiling. I pulled him towards the car to let him know I wanted to leave now. No one needed to see anything else. He made it clear to everyone he wanted and had me. We left the party to go to Pizza Hut and ordered a small cheese pizza. After about 15 minutes of waiting we paid for the pizza and found the closest redbox. We picked two movies each. Of course we ended up with four horror movies. He liked to scare me so I would jump in his arms but he didn't know I faked being afraid just to be in his arms. Either way I was in his arms and he protected me from the movie.
Charlie and I got comfortable in his bed before playing the first movie. My head was resting on his chest and I had my arm resting on his stomach while he wrapped his arm I was laying by around me. The first movie had begun and I was already falling asleep and so was he. We were extremely tired from the party and didn't even bother trying to stay up for the movie. I was glad to be in his arms for the night and I'm sure he'd be happy I was in his too, especially after everything that happened today.
