I: Hey, can you go get some donuts?
A: Baby, can't you see? I'm calling.
I: .....
A: A guy like you should wear a warning
I: the only thing i need a warning for is when you randomly send me song lyrics.
A: It's dangerous. I'm falling.
I: Seriously, this is kinda getting old!
A: There's no escape, I can't wait!
I: >.>
A: I need a hit! Baby, give me it!
I: the only thing i'm giving you is the silent treatment if you continue doing this.
A: You're dangerous. I'm loving it.
I: .......
A: Too high, can't come down! Losin' my head. Spinin' 'round and 'round!
I: I hate you.
A: Do you feel me now?
I: the only thing I feel right now is annoyance.
A: With the taste of your lips i'm on a ride! You're toxic! I'm slipping under!
I: are you going to do the whole song?
A: With a taste of poison paradise!!
I: are you not going to stop till I sing along?
A: I'm addicted to you! Don't you know that you're toxic!
I: And I love what you do! Don't you know that you're toxic!
A: It's getting late, to give you up!
I: I took a sip from my devil's cup!
A: Slowly, it's taking over me!
I: Too high, can't come down!
A: Loosin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round! Can you feel me now?!
I: i don't know the rest....
A: me either.
