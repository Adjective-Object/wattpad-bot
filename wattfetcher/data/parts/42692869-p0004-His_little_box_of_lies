A/N: I didn't know which name I should use for Hong Kong, thinking he would be a good friend for Emil, but on the wikia it said his name in English would be considered Leon if anyone was wondering.____________________________________________________________________________________
It was pretty normal for Emil and me to sit in class together. Whenever we get the chance, we'll take it. Since we sat next to each other in history today, we were paired together for a project by Mr. Adnan. I think Emil really likes this teacher compared to others. So, at least some good came out of that. We made arrangements at lunch earlier today to meet up at his house for the project. Once school was finished, we took our bikes and rode home. We got there and he brought me to his always perfect and clean room. It's not like this was new to me. I've been to his house before.
Emil doesn't have many friends. I'm lucky to be one of them though. We also have Lili and Raivis in our small group of friends. We have lunch together and meet up after school every once in a while. We are a pretty interesting group of people. We like making stories and talking about our dreams. The dreams usually inspire us for real stories. I guess you could call us the real dream team. Emil is good company though, to anyone really. He gets along well with his brother ever since they started living alone, and always gets along with the teachers, usually volunteering or getting extra credit in Mr. Adnan's class. I think his first name is Sadik. I did some fund raising once with the rest of our group and he participated, so he had to give us his name.
Emil had to go get supplies for the project, and had to get the laptop, so he left for a moment. I went through my bag started pulling things out for an early start. I got out my papers, but I drop my pencil case and it broke, pencils going every where. I picked up as many as I could, noticing some were hiding under his desk and his bed. When I reached for my colored pencils that rolled under his bed, I found them next to something else. It was a box of some sort. Maybe one of Emil's old toys. I pulled it out from underneath and found out it was a shoe box.
I started picking up the rest of my pencils just to finish up the job. I finally finished and started looking more closely at the box. On the side there was something written in wax crayon by a kid. I couldn't really tell what it said, being so messy. I tossed back the top of the box and found a bunch of little pieces of paper filling it. It was practically over flowing. I took one of the little pieces in hand. It had some of Emil's hand writing on it. So this was indeed his. I read what was written on the paper.
This was Emil? I'm not sure if this is really him. Yes, it does involve his hand writing and perspective, but this just doesn't sound like the Emil I've learned to know. My first thought was that it was impossible... but now that I think of it, this is very much like him. I can't believe he lied to us like that. Sure, it was something he would want to keep secret, but no one else in the group lies about this. At least I don't. If I didn't want to tell them, I would just tell them it was something private and they never questioned it, and it goes the other way around for everyone else. But why would he lie instead of just telling us he didn't want to talk about it?
I put the box back under his bed, the bed where his lie took place. It was weird, though. But I guess it would make sense for him to dream about this, what with losing his parents when he was young and being taken care of by his grand father. I think he passed away last year. Lucky for Emil, he has Lukas. Lukas is always so caring for Emil, finding time to take care of himself and someone else.
He came back with the laptop and some more papers a few moments later. We worked on the plan and finding information. We work pretty fast when we are paired up together. But I was a little bit slower considering the situation I just found out about. It was so distracting to know about Emil's dream. I couldn't stop thinking about him dreaming Mr. Adnan as his father even after I left for my house.
