Erin's POV
Jordan, my boyfriend. Ha Ha my boyfriend Ahhh. Jordan came over with no reason as to why, he just did.
"Oh, Jordan." I said when he got there with a bag of cookies and a coffee for me and one for him
"OOH, Jordan." I heard my mother shout from the kitchen
"Shut up." I said to her kidding around before giving Jordan a kiss in the cheek
"Oh me again?"he said with a small smile.
We went to my room and I sat on the bed and he sat on a chair next to it, I gave him a big long kiss before asking why he came.
"Hi, Baby." he said
He moved to the bed and put his face in my neck and wrapped his arm around me.
"Why are you here? I didn't know you were gonna be here." I asked
"Because... I like you... a lot" He responded.
"Aww, bae." I said
"Why is this how our conversations are?" He said breathing down my neck
"Because your amazing and I can't get over it." I said
"You are even more amazing then me." He said while looking into my eyes.
"And beautiful and wonderful and everything." He said.
