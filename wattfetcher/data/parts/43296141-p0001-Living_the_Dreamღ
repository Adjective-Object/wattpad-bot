First day in High School. It was a beautiful sunny Thursday. His hands were shaking, we was terrified of that new beginning. He thought that he would be alone with no friends. He was almost scared. His mother had to throw him cold water to make him get up. His look was really angry, but he passed beside her and got into the bathroom. He had quick shower and then he dressed up. As he was brushing his teeth, he looked himself blankly in the mirror and thought:
"What am I going to do? I'm so shy and scared of everything.. How am I going to get through this again?.."
He kept staring at his reflection for a couple of seconds and then he said:
"I guess we'll have to find out then.."
"What do you mean, son?" his mother was heard behind the door.
"Forget it. I'm going to school. I'll be back soon." He replied while heading to the entrance door.
