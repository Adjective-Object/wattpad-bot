"Zan?! Se nu exxep rejek ya?" What?! She hasn't accepted the rejection yet?
I nod.
Orion slings my arm over his shoulder and carries me towards the pack hospital. I try to resist and fall onto the ground, the pain ebbing away slowly.	"She would have felt all that. Twice as much."
Orion stares blankly at me.
"I'm such an idiot."
"That couldn't be canis loccos. Your eyes haven't turned yellow."
"I'm so stupid."
"Yeah, that hurt quite a bit."
I glare at him.	"Take me back to my office."
Orion crosses his arms over his chest. "I'm going to get Dr. Lan."
"No."
He glares at me.
I give in. "Fine."
How I hope I hadn't listened.
