~EndlessRawr *******************************Leena's POV *8 years ago*
I sat at the tree at the end of my driveway, watching my house burn down. Tears streamed down my face, remembering the last thing my Mom had said to me.
**Flashblack**"Run, honey, don't look back, you have a whole life ahead of you, me and your father... we.... we love you..." she closed her eyes and like she said, I ran and I didn't look back.**End Of Flashback**
What should I do? Should I run away? I thought as I stood up from beside the tree. I looked at my scorched clothes, all torn and black with ash smell aminating from them. I looked at my skin and saw ashes all over it. "It looks like I'm an African American, not that that's a bad thing..." I murmured to myself as I walked down the empty road. I stood up straight, wiped my clothes with my palms of my hands, and walked on. "I can take care of myself, I'm strong, I don't need anyone to care for me," I said to myself, not really convincing my mind completely. I didn't care if I looked like crap, I would live on the street and care for myself, I didn't need anyone.*******************************
Alright! Ya ya I know it was short, but hey! It was a PROLOGUE! A prologue doesn't have to be long! Anywho, I hope you will stick around for the first chapter of Homeless my Little Lions!
