"There are much deeper reasons why this band is dangerous. Much deeper reason why I'm here..here now. You can't know why yet and you will just have to accept it. Okay. Just fu*king accept that you are being kept from something extremely dangerous. Both of us, mom and me, are doing this for your safety. Go ahead and hate us, but know that we care about you a hell of a lot to be doing what we're doing."
I watched Luke storm off, slamming the chair into the table. That sudden action made me jump a bit. He just left me sitting at the table with words that still made me utterly confused.
Getting up from the table, copying Luke's action of putting the chair back, I grumbled as I yanked open the pantry. Before stomping to my room, I made a cup of black tea with a tiny bit of cream. The box that held the tea bags said it was supposed to help with stress.
While I was pulling on my pajama pants, Luke's voice made me jump. He was yelling at someone through the walls. He was aggressively shouting undecipherable words. No matter how hard I pressed my ears to the wall, and they were thin walls too, I couldn't understand anything he was saying.
Easy words like 'I', 'and ', 'to', 'the', 'for', were the only types of words I could clearly understand. A minute went by before I gave up. I shoved my arms and head through a t-shirt.
I plopped myself down next to Jordan. She was too into the show playing to notice I was in the room again. Which means I was right earlier, she couldn't hear my outburst. I tried to focus on the tv show, but our conversation and Luke's shouting just now left my mind a skittering mess.
Mom and I are definitely talking soon though. I need answers. Now more than ever.
