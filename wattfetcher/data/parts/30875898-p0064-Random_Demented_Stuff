Everyone thinks your life is fucking perfect
They think that smile on your face is actually real
If it's the worst then you, you've been through it
You can run and hide but they're gonna find you
A d you can't hide these secrets forever
Yet they don't even notice
All of them, they say they love you
Then why do they do these hateful things to you
Not even the closest will ever realize
You know to them it'd be a giant suprise
You always hide the truth
You fall asleep and practice getting the knot loose
They don't know that you've been through this
They don't know that you've already been through it
