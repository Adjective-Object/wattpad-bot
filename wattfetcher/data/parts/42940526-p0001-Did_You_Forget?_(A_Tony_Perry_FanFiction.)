"I am not afraid to keep on living."

"Hey Tony." I greeted before letting my nephew run away. Tony smiled and walked to me, he's more tattooed than I remember.
"Hi, Violet." Tony said. "So how's it going?" He asked.
"Good, just living in general. I'm a tattoo artist." I said. Tony's eyes widen and nodded.
"Awesome." He simply said.
"Kids! Time for cake!" Ariana yelled out to the kids.
"Shall we go?" I asked, Tony nodded before stepping aside to let me go first. I chuckled and thanked him.

"Happy birthday dear Michael! Happy birthday to you!" We all sang. Michael smiled and blew out the candles.
After the cake was cut, and the kids got a slice, Tony and I sat down on the patio. We both just talked about outlives and how we're doing.
"So yeah, I have my apartment up there. San Fransisco is amazing." I said.
"Yeah, it is." Tony smiled.
"And you?" I asked him.
"Well, of course I'm still living here. On the side of the band I have a guitar shop." Tony said, I smiled. I always knew he wanted to open a guitar shop.
"Nice." I said.
~Tony's POV~
How did I ever let someone so amazing, so beautiful, so kind just go. And it's all my fault. My overly horny ways got the best of me. That was just the teenage me, I'm not obsessed with sex anymore. I've now realized there's more than just pleasure.
"Hey Tony!" Jaime called me where he was hanging out with Vic and Mike. I looked over to him and tilted my head, saying hey. "Get over here!" I nodded and got up, leaving Violet with the girls. When I got to the guys, Vic handed me a beer.
"Hanging out with the girls I see." Mike said.
"Yeah, Violet and I are catching up." I said.
"You know you've been quiet and shy since she left." Jaime mentioned.
"You okay turtle?" Vic asked.
"Yeah." I said.
"So you Laddies ready for warped tour?!" Mike almost yelled out. We all chanted, clinking our beer bottles together. Warped tour starts this week, Friday. The first date is Pomona, I'm fucking pumped.
"Dude! Fucking Attila is coming!" Jaime said. This is the first warped tour we're going with newer bands, I have to say, the line up is awesome.
"Hell yeah! Fronz and I really have to hit that blunt." Mike said, we all chuckled.
"Daddy, can I come with you on tour?! I really wanna see you play!" Michael exclaimed. Mike chuckled as he picked up his son.
"Of course, you and mommy are." I smiled and looked to Ariana who was with the girls. I remember when she was a little girl, now she's grown up and a mom now. Damn, time goes by quick.
I then noticed Lynn with Ruby cuddled up next to her. Lynn has her band too, PVRIS, and they're touring with us. I remember in the beginning of this year, Lynn got a bunch of shit for being a lesbian. She said she doesn't care because she knows the person that she is and that's important. Lynn looked to me and playfully winked to me, I blushed lightly and tilted my head back, greeting her. Lynn smiled and continued to talk with the girls.
