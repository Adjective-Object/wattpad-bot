"Okay, you can do this..." Chicken tried to calm himself down to keep his waiter facade and help Scott on his date with Jade at the same time. "You've been in tougher situations than this... Oh, I hope they don't know it's me..."
Chicken went to their table and cleared his throat, trying to look casual. "Welcome to Pops, may I take your order?"
Mike and her gang told Chicken what they want and he wrote it down like a real waiter would and went to the kitchen.
"You know, that waiter looks awfully familiar." Mike said to her friends.
"He's probably just a new worker." June shrugged.
"Now that you mention it, Mazinsky, that fry cook looked familiar," Jo spoke up. "Is it my imagination or did that fry cook keep saying 'DPA and Scoopie'?"
"Cookies and milk!" Ed blurted out.
Dee Dee laughed at her boyfriend. "Ed, you're so funny!"
Ed laughed with her.
Chicken came back with their orders. "All right, guys... Here's your food. Enjoy it and what not."
Mike looked at her food. "Ummm...."
"I think my salad is moving..." Double D looked alarmed.
Abby ate her fries and instantly spit them out. "My fries are not done..."
"My milkshake is frozen solid." Justine added.
Meanwhile, Chicken was waiting on Scott and Jade, until someone tapped him on the shoulder.
"You think this is funny?" Duncan glared at him.
"In a cosmic sort of way, yes." Chicken shrugged his wings.
"Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?" Duncan asked, lifting up the sandwich he ordered.
"What? It's just an ordinary cheese--" Chicken shrugged, then looked at the cheeseburger and got disgusted. "OH, MY GOODNESS! ...LIGHTNING!!"
"Lightning!" the gang then.
"Sha-what, Chicken?" Lightning looked over his shoulder.
"Chicken!" the gang then gasped.
Jo ripped off the mustache from Chicken's beak.
"Owww!" Chicken winced.
Lightning looked to see Jo, Duncan, and Abby cracking their knuckles. "Oh..."
"Crap." Chicken finished.
Scott was about to go in the diner with Jade, but he saw Lighting and Chicken getting beat up.
"Umm... Let's go to the Caf√©." Scott said quickly.
"Why?" Jade asked.
"Because it's more easier to spend money there!"
Jade shrugged. "Hmm... Okay."
"Sha-Owch!!" Lightning grunted.
"I think I can taste my spine..." Chicken moaned.
