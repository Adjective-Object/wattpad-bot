The gang is in high school, and they are 17; seniors.
Maya was in Lucas' house. They were making out on the couch. No they are not dating, everyone knows that. They are completely single.
Lucas' mom busted in. "Mom! Get out" Lucas yelled. Oh, one more thing. Lucas is a bad boy, since when he told everyone his reputation back in Texas.

It all started one summer. Maya and Lucas just wanted somebody to love, and to make out with. If one broke up with someone they would make out with the other. If someone got into a fight with a random person they would come running, and start making out.That's all they did . They never had sex, because they think its gross, and they hate each other. But that can all change, in an instant.
