"Okay, we're going to let you down now!"
"Kay!" They did something with the rope and I was slowly being brought back down. Soon I reached the ground and made a steady landing.
"You good?" Joss asked me.
"Yeah, I'm ready." Everyone got set up and we began to do the last couple seconds of the scene.
"And... Action!"
"Hey, I'm gonna be out late. Don't wait up!" Halfway through my line, I felt the rope being pulled and I was lifted off the ground. Tony and Fury kept their gaze on me as I flew up and never looked down. Once I was out of shot, the scene was done. We did the scene a few more times, and with a few more bloopers. After it was done, I was taken out of the harness and then moved onto our last scene for the day.
I saw Age of Ultron last night.......... It was awesome.
