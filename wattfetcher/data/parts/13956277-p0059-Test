That's what scares me the most. To fall in love, to be attach myself with the wrong person, I'm afraid of falling.
Love is not haram, feelings cannot be controled but, what people do behind the name of love from dating to physical contacts without being engaged or married is haram.

As always, I walked to my school, got flirted by some perverts, reached school, saw some girls wearing some see-through clothes, got flirted by some boys, walked to my locker and here he comes ...
"Where have you been ? haven't seen you after the sl-"
"Pshhhhht" I cut Jake off by covering his mouth with my palm.
"W-hat" He struggled to speak while my hand wasn't letting him.
"You better forget about it and never tell anybody if you don't want to lose a part of you" I threatened.
"What's all of that for ?" He frowned.
"Just don't" I pulled my books and walked to my class.
"Psssst Leena" I ignored.
"Hold on" I responded.
"We got a great prank listen, we-"
"Sorry Tom, I won't join" I walked past him.
"Why" Peter asked.
"Because I never repeat my mistakes" I said then headed to learn some Math.
"Hey Leena, the first to arrive, as always" Teacher Jason said and I chuckled.
"Teacher, can I ask for something please ?" My eyes were full of hope.
"Sure, anything for my best student" He smiled.
"Can I change my seat ? please" Ya Allah make this puppy face work.
"May I know the reason behind this request ?"
"It's just a personal thing"
"Jake isn't it ?" I nodded.
"I don't see any problem, in fact, I'm impressed that you didn't fall for him though he flirts with you on public"
"Just please Jason"
"Jason ? Just Jason?" This teacher was pretty young so saying Mr. or Teacher before his name didnt sound fit.
"Please Mr. teacher Dr. professor space scientist Jason" He exploaded in laughter.
"Okay Okay. You'll sit in the first row, I'll convince Melissa to sit back there beside Jake *pause* After thinking, I guess I won't have to convince her; she'll go flying beside Jake" I laughed.
"Yeah, guess so"
Like what Jason said, Melissa went flying to be beside Jake. Only if you could see his face.
.......
I walked in the hallway beside Diana and Helen.
We heard a laughing crowd few feetÂ away.
"What's going on ?" I asked.
"It must be Miley and Conor bullying Robin, poor little Robin, he's 2 years younger" Diana said.
I ran and crossed the crowed until I saw a muscular guy pinning a short skinny one to the wall while Miley was telling him some horrible things.
"HEY YOU" I gained the muscular guy's attention, who was probably Conor.
