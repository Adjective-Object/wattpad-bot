"We have it cornered!" Canada cheered as he and Russia battled against the short alien creature in the bottom left corner of the bloodied room.

Russia looked down at the creature and smiled."So, what do you prefer? Burning until not even your ashes are left, or being frozen up for the rest of your life? ...Just kidding~! I won't give you a choice." he laughed. Once he attacked the monster and made it disappear upon defeat, he smirked. "It's okay, I won't give you time to have any regrets, either."


Once all of the monsters were gone, they all gathered in the center of the room. "Thank God...somehow, we managed to swipe them clean..." Japan said, taking a deep breath of relief.


England nodded. Â "Italy's journal made a lot of them disappear, and yet that was still tough. Well done, Italy-" he suddenly stopped when he realised that the person was nowhere to be seen.


"Veneziano?" Romano said in a low voice, looking around the room.


Russia frowned. "Italy? Hey, he's...he's gone...isn't he?"


"...West is gone, too!" Prussia exclaimed as he noticed that his younger brother wasn't there, either.

Japan's relieved state had faded. "A-Along with....(Name)-chan..."


"And...America...too..." Canada stated in a worried tone.


Spain enumerated them, raising fingers. "So...Ita, Germany, (Name) and America are gone...? They're the ones who were close to the journal, aren't they?" he pointed out.


"There were so many enemies that I didn't even notice...I'm sorry...we were supposed to run away the moment we secured an exit..." Japan said, hinting regret.


China looked at them. "Do you think they're...gone? Because of the journal..."


"Gone...as in...dead?" France said slowly, horrified at the thought.


Prussia shook his head. "That's impossible! I'll look for them! But...I don't know where to start..."



All of a sudden, they heard a phone ring.
