"Thank you for coming with me tonight." I said quietly.
"Thank you for asking me to come." He said and turned to kiss me.  I kissed him back wrapping my arms around his waist pulling him a little closer.
Alan pulled away after a few moments and smiled at me, "You're adorable."
"I think you're talking about yourself."
He shook his head, "Nope now hush and learn to take a compliment." He said and kissed me again. He wrapped his arms around my neck.  I pulled away a little and smiled at him. I couldn't believe he was actually my boyfriend. It's so crazy but absolutely wonderful.
Alan smiled at me and climbed off of my lap carefully and moved to sit across from me, "Here now it's easier for you to row."
I nodded and started rowing along down the river.
"I feel like this is a scene from the little mermaid." I muttered smiling at him.
"Yeah?"
"Yeah its kind of funny."
"Well then I guess you have to kiss me then."
"Well I guess so." I said and leaned forward.
He smiled at me before meeting my lips with his. The kiss was short lived sadly as the boat toppled over knocking the two of us into the water.
"Ew." Alan whined coming to the surface and pouting at me. "Austin it's so gross!"
"Yeah I know." I said, "Lets just swim to shore or something."
"But it's so gross." He said again.
"Yes baby I know. Now come on swim with me."
He frowned but the two of us swam to shore quickly. I grabbed his hand and walked with him back to solid ground.
"Well besides that, did you have fun tonight?"
"Are you kidding tonight was amazing Aust! Even falling out of the boat."
"Really?"
"Of course." He said smiling,"It was one of the best dates I've ever been on."
I smiled, "I'm glad."
"Thank you so much for tonight." He said and kissed me softly before pulling away and shivered, "But I think I'm ready to go back to the bus and get some dry clothes on,"
"Me too."
We walked back to the street and we realized we didn't have a phone since well we fell into a river. So we walked to a random shop and called a taxi again.
"I can't believe our phones are ruined." Alan complained as we waited for the taxi.
"Yeah I know but we can go get new ones tomorrow or something."
"Good," He said and soon the taxi drove up. I walked up and opened the door for him before opening the door for him letting him get in before myself.
The ride back was quick and once we got there the two of us headed straight for our bus.
"I'm taking a shower first." I said as soon as we walked inside.
"Okay, go do it then."
"You're not gonna argue with me on this?"
"No, now go shower before I change my mind."
I smiled and kissed him before walking back to the bathroom. I took my shower quickly and got out, changing into some sweatpants. Once I was finished dressing I let Alan know that the shower was free and went to the lounge with the guys.
