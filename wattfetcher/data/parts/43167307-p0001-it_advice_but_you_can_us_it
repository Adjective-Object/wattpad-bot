Why not to be happy I have a couple reasons why. My 7th grade will give a couple reasons why not to be happy . 1st reason 7th grade squad drama 2nd reason 7th grade boyfriends .
So in 7th grade I had a squad with me, angi, Maddie, madizen, dakota, and Christina it was ether you hated rveryone or just one . We got into so many fights . Make sure ur squad has boys and girls not just girls .
7th grade boys are bad enough but a boyfriend that u have known since 5th grade . Me and my ex boyfriend was a bad idea . How We got together was because people said he liked me and I kinda liked him so I asked him I had to force it out of him tho. And watching everyone say it was amazing to have a boyfriend was wrong cause this guy my best guy friend was the worse boyfriend. He was dating me while he is kinda in love with his best friend he probably doesn't know it yet but he will .
Oh and it sucks likeing ur friend while he just all the sudden stops talking to you . I remember we us to hang out at the park and then he just stopped talking to me and started talking more to this other girl . I was so upset but oh well .
That's why not to be happy all the time .....
But don't be sad all the time but don't be happy all the time . If ur happy the sooooo good for u if ur sad then find a way to be happy . Yes I was talking about being sad but still....... happy is the way to live and if I sound like a fortune cookie the sorry
