"I have a feeling you underestimate your abilities, Lydia."
"Trust me, you'd have better luck with tarot cards."
"Let's find out. Tell me, which one of these men is about to die?"
Malia's POV
Scott Reyes prying the door open. The result? Fail.
"We already looked for a way out.", Kira says to Scott as soon as he stopped trying,"I think a lot of people have."
"I say when that door opens again, we take out whoever's standing in the way and run for it.", I said sharing my brilliant idea.
"What about Lydia?", Aaron asks.
"What about her?", I say not having a care in the world.
"We're not leaving without her.", Scott says giving me a glare.
"Why not?", I argue.
"Because we don't leave without people. Remember, we talked about this? Rules of the wild kingdom don't apply to friends.", Stiles says reminding me about our conversation.
"Is that what you would do as a coyote, leave her for dead?", She says really getting on my nerves.
"If she was weak and injured, yeah.", I pause,"If hunting had been bad that season, I would eat her." I pause again, "Then I'd leave. Mmm."
"Believe it or not, that's progress.", Stiles says with a hint of disappointment.
"All right, guys, we're not dead yet.", He says all leader like.
"And that means Araya wants something.", Aaron says.
"But if the Calaveras don't know where Derek is, that means they didn't take him from the loft. Right? Maybe he left on his own.", Stiles says having a point, just like his cute detective self.
Scott finishes off a hypothesis,"Maybe someone else got to him."
