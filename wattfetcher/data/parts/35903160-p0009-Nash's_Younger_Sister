I just woke up.Wait wasn't Kylie supposed to call me at 3 am?"Hey Mia what flight was Kylie on?"a voice says."4376 from Los Angeles,California to Greensboro,North Carolina.Why?"I ask."Because you might want to see this."He says.Might as well got nothing better to do.'Flight from Los Angeles to Greensboro crashed at 3:30 this morning.There were no surviors.We will get back to you on this story.'I ask Nash a question,"Why'd this happen to her she was my best friend?"I then see Cam and shawn coming downstairs.Nash replies,"I don't know but she's in a better place.Mia if she survived she wouldn't have been able to make it.I then scream,"NASH I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HER BUT NOW SHES DEAD AND WE CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!I HA-"I get interrupted when Cam asks"Whats wrong?"Nash answers because I'm sobbing,"Kylie Savannah Moore died at 3:30 this morning(it hurt writing this because shes my best friend)." "I'll be in my room."I say to no one in particular.I go straight to my closet and get out my guitar and start singing a Thousand Years by Christina Perri.-skip song I'm to lazy to write it all-I call Ava and ask her if she could come over she said yeah so I'm hanging out with her.I take my shower and get out and get dressed in:•white lace tank top•coral shorts•coral braceletsAva then comes in and I go straight into her arms crying."S-s-she d-d-died,"I say in between tears."Who died?"She asks."Kylie."I reply."OMG I'm so sorry baby girl,"Ava says."Can I go to sleep,please?"I ask Ava."Sure,"She says as she exits my room.I go to my bed and go to sleep.
