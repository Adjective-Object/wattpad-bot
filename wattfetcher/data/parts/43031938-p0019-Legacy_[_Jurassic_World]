Owen walked over patting the head of the Belgian Malinois .
"I know no one could ever replace Dino, but you need a dog. " he said. "Rex is awesome and all but you can't bring him into the plains with you."
He saw Keira's eyes glisten with tears as she hugged onto the dog. The dog looked at Owen.
"You'll get used to it." he said. He knelt down beside his wife and the newest addition.
"She's a rescue I found online, I figured it was most fitting to bring her to a sanctuary, she's only two years old."
"What's her name?" Keira asked.
"Athena." he said.
She smiled. "That's lovely. Athena." she repeated. Athena barked happily at her.
"You'll fit in just fine here."
