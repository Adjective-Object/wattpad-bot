Alisa Whites- 14 years old, black hair with a pixie cut, slightly tanned skin, left eye is blue, and right eye gold
"Hi I'm Alissa Whites but everyone calls me Ali" I say grinning and smiling, as I walk towards you in what seems like an empty white background.
"You might wonder how I'm talking to you, but really it's quite simple. Ever since I was young, when I imagined or played present what I was thinking of was where I went. Right now, I'm really just talking to you by breaking the forthwall using my imagination. Well now that explaining is done let me tell you about me. My life isn't exactly the brightest."
My cheerful smile turned into a slight frown. "When I was 5 years old both my parents died in a house fire while I was at daycare back in Washington. Since the rest of my family was suffering financially, I was put up for adaption. After 2 years of living at an orphanage, I was adopted and moved to Connecticut with my new family the Whites" I pull my hair behind my ear and smiles again.
"Now I have a great new family!"
I pull out a family picture. "This is my older sister Lizzy."
I point to a 18 year old teenager with short curly red hair and lots of freckles.
"This is my mom and my dad."
I point at my mom with long blonde hair and pale skin. Next pointing to my dad with red hair and a thick beard.
"Finally these are my younger brother and sister who are twins, Joy and Joey."
Points to two 10 year olds fighting. The girl having long blonde hair and the boy having red hair.
"We'll besides my family I have one other person you must know of."
I pull out a picture of me and a boy with dirty blonde hair. "This is me and my best friend, Lucas. You'll see later in the story how everyone is important. Well good bye!"
I smile and wave, afterwards closing my eyes. Although everything looks dark because my eyes are closed, I feel feel all the color and wind brush past me.
