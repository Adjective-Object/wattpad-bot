"Watcha doing?" I asked.
"Just admiring at how beautiful you are." I smiled and played with his silver cross necklace that was dangling down off his neck in front of my face.
"Really?"
"Truly." He leaned down as I gripped his shirt bringing him closer to me as we locked lips. His tongue licked my bottom lip asking for entrance but I denied for a little fun.
His hand traveled down my waist until the hem of my shirt he stopped for a second before he stuck his hand up my shirt resting on my stomach which made me gasp allowing his tongue to explore my mouth as I let out a moan.
His hand traveled up further until there was a knock at the door and Andy groaned but removed his hand before getting up and opening the door. It was CC. Of course he is always the one that interrupts.
"Lets go we have training." I got up and fixed my shirt. Andy pecked my cheek and drug me out of the room.
