If I took my phone to Neverland would it stay at 100% forever? Let's think about this for a second. My answer has to be a hundred percent yes, because if it has keep Peter Pan young for who knows how long it has to keep phones alive for that long.
I believe I'm going to move to Neverland.
Another thing about Neverland. I believe Neverland is based on Heaven. First of all, everyone is young. Second of all, I think we can all agree that Peter Pan is an angel who is sent down to earth to get all those people that have kicked the bucket. So if Peter Pan is an angel Captain Hook is a demon. Which would explain their endless fighting. Disney I think I just figured out all your secrets.
