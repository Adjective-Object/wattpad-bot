oh- i-
-chuckles-
don't see why you would like me, but there's no reason to be scared I won't yell at you if I don't like you and if I do I'll probably be very happy
-smiles-
I'm pretty scared of rejection and pain too, which is why I tend to avoid relationships but what's life with out a little risk hm?
