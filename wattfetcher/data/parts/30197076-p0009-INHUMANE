"No, No, No..Please !" The Voice Begged Helplessly As His Hand Gripped Me to His Chest Harder.
I Caught A Small Wiff Of His cologne Before My mind Quickly Recognized Him.
Aiken.
My Vision Started Getting Darker and Darker, And The Dim Room Wasnt Helping. My Breathing Was Shallow And my Eyes Wandered Aimlessly Everywhere Around The Room, as I Tried To Stay Conscious.
I barely Had The Energy to Lift my Arms And Wrap it Around Him..
"Why Did You Do It?" He Whispered The Words In My Ear As He Buried His Face In My Coffee Brown Hair.
I Opened My Mouth To Answer But Nothing Came Out. Instead, My Vision Got Extremely Blurry And Darkness Was Slowly Seeping Through It. My Ears Couldnt Distinguish Any Voices But I Could Hear Aiken's Faint Screams And Yells From The Distance.
My Eyes Fluttered Shut Slowly And My Body Slowly Went Limp As Aiken's Painful Words Echoed Through My Head Constantly.
'Why Did You Do It ?' His Voice Rang Faintly In My head, Laced With A Painful And Hurting Tone, Before Slipping Away Into A World Of Pitch Black.
'Oh Aiken, If You only Knew How it Feels..'

There, You Can Choose How To Kill Me, But Please Think Of The Good Memories We Had together.. Know I Havent updated for Almost Three Fluffing Months But Hey ! It Was A long Chapter, Wasnt It ?
Anyways, I Promise I'll Be Updating Frequently Every now And Then As I Am Extremely Excited To Start Inhumane But Slightly Worried And Pressured Because all The Idea Seemed To Crash Together And I Just Cant Put My Finger On Something.
Also I Know The Chapter Seems A Little Vague And confusing But Dont worry, You Should Be.
