"Back off, can't you see we're having some fun here, right lil cheeky?" That was stinky Miley. good nickname it goes with the flow
"Let him go" I commanded Miley and Conor.
"Well well well, look who's here. The stupid Muslim girl herself" Conor laughed evilly.
"Sorry Conor, she's tired and doesn't have any idea about what she's saying" Diana came and pulled me but I didn't move an inch.
"Take your friend away before she gets in any trouble" He turned his face back to Robin
"What can I say ? I'm a troublemaker" I smirked.
"P*** off b****" Conor said.
"I said Let-Robin-Go" I said in a threatening tone.
"You better not provoke me if you don't want any serious injuries" He threatened.
"You better Let him go if you don't want to be suspended" With a challenging tone and a raised eyebrow.
"You better watch your mouth if you don't want the thing over your head to be taken off" Miley snapped her fingers in a Z shape.
"You know that people put some make up on their faces right ? because you put some face on your make up so I just wanted to say ..." People around us gasped.
"Oh you did not" Miley came to my direction but she slipped and fell, Robin stumbled her by his feet.
"You are in a big trouble, cheeky" Conor caught the hem of Robin's shirt and lifted him up until his feet were no longer touching the ground.
Conor raised his fist in the air to punch the little boy's face "You need to face me first" I stood in front of Conor and his eyes widened. He put Robin down "You really think I'm going to punch a girl ?" He mocked.
"Why not ? girls punch girls, its Okay" I mocked and everyone laughed.
"You wanted this" He said, then everything went on slow motion.
Conor put Robin down raised his clenched fist, directed it toward my face, People gasped, I didn't even blink, his fist is getting closer and closer, It's about to touch my face ...
In a fast and swift movement I caught his fist when it was an inch away from my nose, the crowd gasped again and Conor froze.
"I do not think so, little boy. Let him go, if you wanna fight you should kick a man like you, if you were one" I raised an eyebrow
"What is going on here ?" Here comes the problems solustionist Mrrrrr.Sean.
"Nothing Mr.Sean" I smiled.
"Well, can you explain why is ConorÂ directing his fist to your face in a fighting mode?"
"Oh sorry I forgot that" I let go of his hand.
"To my office" Mr.Sean commanded and we followed him like prisoners.
"What's going on ?" Mr.Sean asked.
"Nothing sir, we were just playing around, right Leena?" Conor gave me the 'don't you dare say a word' look.
"No we weren't" I smirked.
"I'd like to know what were you doing there two minutes ago" The principal glared at Connor.
"I'd appreciate it if you let me explain please" The principal nodded.
"Is pinning a boy to a wall and punching him Okay?" I asked.
"What if he was in school?" I frowned.
