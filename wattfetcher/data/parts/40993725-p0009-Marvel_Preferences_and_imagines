Seven months after I met Bruce in McDonalds. It's been seven months since I fell in love. He brought me to his room in Stark Towers. He had Tony put guards up so my ex couldn't get to me, not that my ex wanted me. Bruce kept me in loving arms and made sure I was okay. The bruises and scabs healed, but I was still scared of what could happen.
My loving boyfriend walks in and gently puts his hands on my shoulders and rubbed them as if he could sense they were aching. The movements feel very nice. He moves in closer and moves one hand down to my bulging belly and cups the bottom. He kisses my lips ever so tenderly and leans down to kiss the bump. His lips come back home to peck mine one more time.
"How is my Queen and Prince?" He ask holding us to his chest. He was so adorable. Even though the little boy I am carrying isn't his, he accepted him and loved him like his own son and he wasn't even born yet. He had even told me that he was the hulk, after I caught on that Tony was iron man. He says he is shocked I stayed. He speaks of himself as a monster. He is actually a good guy.
Just as he asked, the baby kicked where his hand is and his smile deepened and showed the wrinkles by his eyes. He kissed my cheek.
"I'm gonna take that as an okay," he laughed. I joined and snuggled to him. His hand slowly ran back and forth, feeling violently hard kicks every now or then.
"I swear that this kid is going to be soccer player," I said as I leaned back into him. I finally got my happily ever after.
