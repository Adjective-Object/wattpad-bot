Leaves fall,as the tree grows,they live a life so short,and as they fall,a new color springs,and yet the old leaves,bare bruises,they know the tree,and own the knowledge,of becoming and prospering life,how light shines,through the branches,and fruit grows,how everything feels,they understand,the meaning of light,soon the bruises,turn all brown,and the leaf shatters,and dies,but one day,the leaf's own decay,will grow,and start the same cycle over again.
