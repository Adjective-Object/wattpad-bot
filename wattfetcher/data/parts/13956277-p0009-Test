"like the school needed more violence haah ?? ugghh terrorists" another girl said
"Since when did terrorists become hot, I'll join if you go on a date with me" a guy mocked
It's because Im in hijab .. because Im muslim
I continued walking until someone blocked my way.
"May I have the honor of staring at these beautiful light brown eyes and that natural beauty" a guy said .. I tried to avoid him but he blocked me again
"Leave her alone Jake" Elina said
"I can't let that beauty go away without putting my hands on it" He whispered in my ear.
I really don't want to break some bones on my first day at school
"please move away I need to go to my class" I said .
"Anything my princess wants" he moved away and I walked away
He whistled "See you later" he said loudly .
All The girls glared at me
"What's wrong with them" I asked Elina
"All of them have been trying to catch Jake's attention and you did without even trying" she answered
He's just a rude dirty boy, why are these girls obsessed with him !
after I took my books, a teacher showed me my locker.
"well well well, look whose locker is beside mine" Oh God please not him again
"Ignoring me huh" he asked .
"Just leave me alone Damon" I said then walked to my first class .
"Sorry teacher I know I'm late but it's my first day here and I don't know anything so I got lost" I apologized
"it's Okay, now class, we have a new student, She's arabian, she won a scollarship and her name is Leena Ahmed, please be nice to her, And My name Is Jason" the teacher said and I nodded
"please have a seat ummm next to Jake" he said
oohhhh please nooooo
Jake let out a chuckle as I sat next to him
"We're meant to be together" he whispered
"Shut Up jake" I looked at who said that .. which was Damon
"Is there any problem boys?" teacher Jason asked but they said No
"Now put your math books in front of you" the teacher started to teach us and I was giving him all my attention until a paper ball hit my arm, I was sure it was from Jake so I didnt take it ... but he kept throwing paper balls at me until I got angry and took one of them.
"Me + you at starbucks 5:00 Pm, Call me"
I ripped the paper and looked at the teacher again, but another one was thrown at me .
I kept ignoring the paper balls until the class ended
I searched for Elina but I didnt find her.
"So is that a yes" Jake blocked me and everyone started to stare at us
"No, That's a No I'm not going out with you" after I said that everyone around us gasped loudly
"No one rejects Jake Mark" he warned me
"Owwhh well, in that case ... It's still a No, I will NOT go out with you even in a million years Jake Mark NEVER EVER " I passed him while everyone was making fun of him
