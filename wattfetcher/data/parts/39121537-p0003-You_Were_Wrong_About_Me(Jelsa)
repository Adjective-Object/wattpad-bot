I ran home, and grabbed my motorcycle.

Yes I had one, but I didn't have a license to go with it. Still you're never in trouble unless you get caught.

I drove to work; which was a karaoke bar called Melodies Music, cheesy nameÂ  I know. Still the owner was really nice, the pay was decent, the uniforms were super cute, it was in a different town so no one saw me, and I got to sing for free.

I walked into it and changed into my uniform, which was a yellow skater skirt, a gray kami, and yellow/black heels. I put my hair down and took off my nerd glasses, and walked out of the changing room.

I bumped into Ariel, who was a fellow waitress with me.

"Hey Ariel! How was your day?"

"Great! Guess what, Eric proposed!"

I hugged her, and we jumped up and down squealing.

"Ariel! I am so happy for you!"

"Thank you! Now let's get to work! This is my last day after all!" she giggled.

"I know, and I am going to miss you so much." I said sadly.

"Hey, you just have two more years, and then you can get out of here as well."

I nodded, still sad.

All of my dreams were being stripped away in two years. The company was going to me, and I had no real choice unless I gave it to Anna.

She wanted to be a famous fashion designer, and I didn't want to take her dream away, so that left it up to me.

Ariel dragged me over to a table, and we started taking orders. Four hours nonstop of guys hitting on us and party girls asking for drinks, I was finished.

I decided to sing one song before I went to Punzie's house.

I choose Little Me by Little Mix, technically I needed four people, but who cares.

I picked up the mic, and started singing my heart out. (A/N: Song is in media section.)

She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl
Voice so quiet you don't hear a word,
Always talking but she can't be heard,

You can see there if you catch her eye,
