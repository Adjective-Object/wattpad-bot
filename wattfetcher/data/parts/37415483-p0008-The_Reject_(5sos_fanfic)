{ Luke's p.o.v. }
I was just walking up to Mikes house when I saw the guys playing basketball.So I walked over to mess around for a bit before practice.(A/N watch video )*Last song of practice *"-no but really what if penguins had-" "Luke just shut up!" Michael yelled at me " you guys lets just get the last song and then we can fuck around" Calum said annoyed " OI DONT SWEAR" Ash shouted " JUST COUNT US OFF ASH" Cal said Ash groaned " FINE ! 1,2,3""Hello there the angel from my nightmareThe shadow in the background of the morgueThe unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valleyWe can live like Jack and Sally if we wantWhere you can always find meAnd we'll have Halloween on ChristmasAnd in the night we'll wish this never endsWe'll wish this never ends
Where are you and I'm so sorryI cannot sleep I cannot dream tonightI need somebody and alwaysThis sick strange darknessComes creeping on so haunting every timeAnd as I stared I countedThe Webs from all the spidersCatching things and eating their insidesLike indecision to call youand hear your voice of treasonWill you come home and stop the pain tonightStop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)Don't waste your time on me you're alreadyThe voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
I miss you (miss you miss you)(I miss you miss you)"
{Lily's p.o.v.} (Time 5 pm )Crying. That's all I've been able to do for the past two hours. What did I do? Why do they hate me? Why does everyone hate me? The only one is my sister and she's never around anymore because she's with her boyfriend more.   (Time 7pm)Lexi still isn't home meaning she probably when to her boyfriends house after work. I just wanna talk to her. I NEED to talk to her. I've been so tempted to do the thing I promised not to. I decided to go to bed to just get this day over with.
