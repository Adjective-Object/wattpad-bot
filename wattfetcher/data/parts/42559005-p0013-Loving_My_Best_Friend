"i couldve handled it jack!" i said knowing that i couldnt even handle it.
"yeah right sabrina! you werent doing anything about!" he says.
i stay quiet because i know he is right, and he knows i know he's right......
we were arguing in ny bathroom while i clean his face up. (pics above, sammy got into it with adrian)
he whinces when i dab his nose i already cleaned up all the blood his face i just needed to get the blood that was behind his nose.
but when i would dab the side of the nose i was moving it a little bit.
"im sorry ,you know what... just hold my sides so when it hurts sqeeuze them" i say knowing it will hurt but i dont care because im the cause of all of this.
"bri, im not going to do that, i will hurt you, and im supposed to keep you from getting hurt not hurt you" he said,
"then just, i dont know....hold on to something, i dont like seeing you in pain!" i say.
"no bri im fine just please hurry"
i sigh. i dab it again and i see him flinch.
i throw the rag on the floor and walk out of the bathroom.
i walk to my bed , sit down and put my head in my hands.
"bri why did you stop, i was fine!" he says. "jack, im not fucking stupid!"
"i never said you were!" "well quit saying your fine , i know your not fine! i know it hurts you , im not dumb i saw you flinch!"
"it doesnt matter just come on and finish" he said grabbing my hand and standing me up.
i yank my arm away." NO OK NO! because of me you look like this! all of this is my fault! i should've listened to you! so go ahead say "i told you so! i deserve it! i should've let cole fucking rape me, and we wouldnt be in this position right now!"
then i see him walk fast towards me, he grabs my waist pulling me close grabs the back of my neck and does something i never thought my BEST FRIEND would do............
he kisses me.......
