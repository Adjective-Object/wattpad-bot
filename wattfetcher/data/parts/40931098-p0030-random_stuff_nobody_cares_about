okay so I'm watching that play through because I had loved the jiwoo one so much even though I ended up crying at the end cause feels (tHEYRE COMING BACK I REMEBER)

ans the new person they went after has a sister who is dying

and dodger just gave her the worst voice

and cry was dying and I'm just here like

"//actually fell off the bed"

and no I was on the verage of tears thenthe voice happens and I start laughing so hard

legit ito beautiful

//screams the lyrics at the top of my lungs

bUT YET I CANT STAY, I MUST LEAVE YOU AGAIN

BUT I WILL FIND YOU, THE PRECIOUS ONE IN MY MEMORY
