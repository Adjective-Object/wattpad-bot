Niall had maked a chicken salad and now we sat outside eating it. It was delicous! I wonder what I'm gonna do with this.. Should I choose Harry? I really don't want to hurt him again! The boys was really quiet now and that wasn't good news all the time. I got a text from Andreea "Harry said that you quit school? Why?" Oh.. Yea I dropped out of school so I could get a job.. "I need a job, I don't have time for school then" I guess Andreea will make it good and Ina too.. Then I got a message from mom. I already told her so it needs to be something else than school. "Have a great holiday! Getting over soon with some stuff" What holiday? I have to work three weeks straight now! "Uhm May? Can I ask you about something?" Harry sai after a while. "Sure" I said and looked at him. "Do you want to join the tour with us again?" He asked with a smile. I smiled back and nodded. Of course I wanted to, I guess 5sos is there too, but now I will not care about Ash.. You know what happend last time.. We ate up the food and went back inside. My mom was soon coming over so I needed to look a little better.. She probably would ask if I was sick. -1 hour later-My mom came over with alot of new clothes and it was so beautiful clothes there! I tried them on and Harry couldn't stop staring at me when I tried a tight, short dress. "You look so beautiful" Louis said when he saw me. I could see that Harry got jealous, but he knows that I love him. I got back in the hoodie and jeans and said thanks to my mom for the new clothes. "Have a great time on tour again! We love you" "thanks mom! I love you too" She was here for two hours and then she had to go back home. I can't wait to join the boys on a second tour! And this one is going to be a tour to remember
