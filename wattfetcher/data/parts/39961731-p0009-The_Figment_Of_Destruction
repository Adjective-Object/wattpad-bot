We continued laughing until the bell rang. I ran to homeroom and found Lily sitting at a corner alone. I sat next to her and her eyes lit up. This is not gonna be pretty.
"Hey." I began to say.
"Hi." Lily squealed. "Did you do it?"
"Yeah. I did it." I answered.
"So... what did he say?" Lily questioned.
I took a deep breath. "He said... no. I'm sorry, Lily."
Her eyes widened. "What?! No. You're joking, right?!"
"No, I'm not. He really did say no..."
"Oh..."
"I'm sorry..."
"It's okay." Lily calmly replied. I was surprised at this. I thought she would go all Niagara Falls. "It's not your fault. He's really hard to get to."
"He is? Never noticed it."
"Of course, you haven't. You're not into all this girly stuff and having a crush on someone."
"You're right, but I like myself like this."
"I wish I had your confidence."
"Really?"
"Yeah. You can do whatever you want and you don't have a single doubt about it. You're not afraid of anything."
"Oh." I saw Jesse enter the room. "I'm gonna go sit with Jesse." Lily nodded. I got up and sat next to him when he found a seat.
"Did you talk to Lily?" Jesse asked me.
"Yeah." I responded.
"How did she take it?"
"She's surprisingly fine about it."
"She's probably really sad about it on the inside."
"I doubt that."
"Fine. Believe what you want. But I know I'm always right."
"Sure, buddy. Sure." The bell rang and people were rushing out the door. Once I got to my locker, Alex and Max tackled me until we were all on the floor.
