I barely got any sleep last night. I've been more worried than I've ever been in my entire life.
Today was the day I would ask my best friend/boyfriend also known as Phillip Michael lester the question.
We were going to DisneyLand today. That's were I would ask him. We were going with cat. She's the only one that I'm going to tell and help me plan it.
I paced around my room and looked in the mirror at my reflection. I practiced what I was going to say a gazillion times.
"Er...ph-phil I well...w-will you marry me?"
"Will you um...marry me?"
"Phil...I uh...marry m-"
I was cut off when phil walked into into my room.
"Hey dan!" The beautiful man said leaning against my door.
"Oh! Phil! I uh...h-hi! How are you?" Is their something you need?"
He giggled. "Are you alright dan? You've been acting jumpy lately."
"Yup! Perfectly fine!"
"I don't believe you. Tell me what's wrong."
"Phil I told you I'm fine."
"Daaan...tell mee!" He whined and pouted.
"alright fine, you win. Um...well this is hard to say uh...I'm scared of going on planes." I lied.
"Well I can assure that you will be okay. If you get too scared you can hold on to me." Phil smiled.
Oh I'll be holding onto you alright.
"Thanks Phil. Its nice to know your there to help me."
"Of course, no problem! I love you dan. Now get dressed our flight leaves in an hour"
I smirked at his bossy ways.
"Yes daddy."
"Shut up" Phil replied blushing and with that he left my room. It was empty once again.
