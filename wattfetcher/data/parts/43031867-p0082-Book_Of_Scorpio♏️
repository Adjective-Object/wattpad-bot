Scorpio's can be extremely half and half when it comes to socializing. Some are more inclined to speak to new faces, while most are skeptical about the idea. Being that they are observers, a Scorpio will likely scope out the situation and go from there. In a new social setting, you'll see a Scorpio starring at people (sometimes hey don't realize they're doing it). This is their way of analyzing the people they're around. Sometimes Scorpio can give off the vibe that they don't want to be social, as noted from their tendency to be in their own world. Once comfortable, a Scorpio can talk excessively.
