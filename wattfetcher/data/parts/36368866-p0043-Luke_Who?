"Where is everyone?" I asked casually but a little suspicious.
"You know where Calum is, but the others are sleeping too." He said with a hint of anger in his voice. My cereal pouring came to a stop with Luke's words.
"Why would I know where Calum is?" I tried to keep my voice cool, but my action beforehand gave it away.
"I'm not stupid Katie." He shoved a spoonful of cereal in his mouth before continuing. "He wasn't in his room when I went in this morning. Plus I heard you screaming earlier and saw him check on you."
BUSTED! Luke was clearly unhappy with the idea of Calum sleeping in the same bed as me. My cheeks warmed up fast at the thought of what Luke must be thinking.
"Nothing happened Luke. He stayed because I didn't want to be left alone." It was awkward having to explain this to my brother. With Jordan I could probably make a few light-hearted jokes about it. However Luke wasn't Jordan. His eyes were giving off a signal that told me I was under his judgment.
"I know that. Again, I'm not stupid. Just be careful Katie. You're smart but don't let emotions blind you against reality." Luke gathered up his bowl and left the kitchen. I was stunned. And confused. What the heck did he mean by that? I know well enough to keep my emotions under control while under these jobs. Did he mean something against Calum? My mind yelled at me to go after Luke to drag out more information. However, I remained glued to my spot. The clock on the stove proved that it was way too early for these thoughts.
