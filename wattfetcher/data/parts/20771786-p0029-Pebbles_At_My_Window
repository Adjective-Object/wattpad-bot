That guy: see, I told you that you're scary
(Shocked) me: Liam?
Liam?: surprise
Hehe! Girly giggle right there. The most girly of girl giggles just came out of my mouth. He did look up my number in the phone book. If he really needs someone to paint his garage, I'll do it!
Me: how did you get my number?
I tried to act cool about it. I didn't want him to know that I was freaking out on the other side of the screen.
Liam: I asked you and you gave it to me
For some reason I don't remember this. Did I really do that? Why didn't I remember? Ohhhh. It was in gym and he was, you know, looking all manly and I guess my teenage girl spirt just came over me. Olivia logic.
Me: oh
Liam: yeah Livvie ;)
Me: no. No way are you calling me that
Liam: too late, good night Livvie ;)
Hehe! A winky face! Another one of my girly giggles squeezed past my lips without a warning. I texted him goodnight and slept like I was in a perfect movie.
