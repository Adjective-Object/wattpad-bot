We got surprisingly comfortable on the cave floor and sat up against the wall cuddling close together. We talked about anything that came to mind and even played "I Spy" like little kids do. We even had our own little dance. We played music from our phones and danced like nobody was watching, which nobody was, and we even had a slow dance together which was actually kind of fun. He held his hand out and asked if he could have that dance, I chuckled and obviously said yes. After we danced I told Charlie about my dad from old memories to the basics about him. I knew I could trust Charlie and maybe that's why I felt it was so easy to tell him but I think it was mainly because I trusted him so much I knew I could talk to him about it.
"You know when I used to come here alone I felt guilty. I felt like I was the one that got to escape and he couldn't. I felt like he should've been able to escape and not me. Now maybe it's time to start escaping with someone new." He knew I meant him by the cute little smirk that formed on his face.
"Only if you want me to be that person." His smirk changed into a genuine smile. I nodded and we sat in silence as we waited for the perfect time to leave to go see my mom. We left about half an hour later because we started getting hungry. We picked up some food and then made our way towards my house. I thought to myself "Oh this should be fun, shouldn't it?" I mentally face palmed myself. What the hell am I doing, she's not going to listen she never does.
