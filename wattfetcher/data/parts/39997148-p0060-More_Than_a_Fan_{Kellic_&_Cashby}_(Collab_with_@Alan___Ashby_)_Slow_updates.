"Oh man, sorry." He said, "But hey it'll be over soon."
I rolled my eyes and we all went through the soundcheck quickly. Thankfully everything went smoothly as did the practice with Johnny and the rest of the band that is until we finished.
"Vic can I talk to you." Johnny said once we were done with soundcheck.
"No."
He sighed and grabbed my arm pulling me close to him I stared at him with wide eyes especially when he kissed me.
"What the hell are you doing!" I shouted pushing him off me, "Don't fucking touch me. Leave me the hell alone!"
"Come on Vic, tell me you didn't feel that." He said pulling me back to him trying to kiss me again.
"Fuck off." I told him and proceeded to punch him in the face.
"Of damn." Someone behind us muttered, I glared at Johnny a little longer before stomping off. I can't believe he fucking did that! What's wrong with him doesn't he know that no means no?
"Hey, what was Johnny doing?"
"Being a fucking asshole." I muttered heading back to the buses. "I'm not singing that stupid song with him anymore. I'm fucking done."
"Vic you have to sing it." Mike said when I got back on the bus.
"No." I said, "I'm not singing with him for the rest of the tour. I'm done with this shit." If Johnny is going to be doing that shit and won't leave me alone then I'm done. I can't sing another song with him no matter how much the kids like it.
"Kids are waiting for that song."
"I know but would you rather I deal with some weirdo perv or have the kids miss one song?" I asked.
"It's only one song and then you're done with him."
"No."
"Come on."
"Nope." I said stubbornly.
"I can't force you but just think about it."
"Think about!? No he kissed me today! I'm sick of him! I don't even want him on tour with us."
"Well we can't just kick the band off tour halfway through."Tony said rolling his eyes, "Just do the song with him. After you punched him I doubt he's going to do anything."
"You think me punching him in the face is gonna stop him? No he's gonna think I'm playing hard to get! I know him and he isn't go to fucking stop."
"Well you need to sing the stupid song. It's a fan favorite. Everyone loves it and you're singing it no arguments." Mike said sternly.
I glared at him, "No."
"Victor don't make me call mom." Mike said, he sounded pissed.
"Fine. I'll do it." I said immediately. Everyone thinks it's just a petty threat what they don't understand is that my mother will not hesitate to come to whatever city we're in and knock some sense into us.
"That's the spirit!" Jaime said patting my back and I glared at him.
"Shut up."
"Shutting up now."
"Good now how long do we have before it's time to go on?" I asked.
"In about three hours or so." Tony said.
"Good," I said. "I think I'm going to go out for a while."
