A thousand people,
Living a thousand lives.
A thousand people,
Drinking a thousand lies.
A thousand people,
With poetic eyes.
A thousand people,
Stuck in the labyrinth of time.
A thousand people,
With their own dreams.
A thousand people,
Who hate the sun's rays.
A thousand people,
Dedicated to what they know.
A thousand people,
With their own doubts.
A thousand people,
With a thousand thoughts.
