There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but I loved him
There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but I knew his struggles
There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but I cried with him
There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but I started to cut when he cut
There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but I knew he was close to the edge
I wrote in my journal, that he didn't know it, but I was going to help him... and I did
There was this boy, he didn't know it yet, but when he grew up, he saved me
