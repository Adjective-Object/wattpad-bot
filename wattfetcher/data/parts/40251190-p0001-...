Im done fighting for people to stay when in the end they all leave anyway... I hate it though because when people start to leave they take their sweet goddamn time doing it. Its always "oh I never will." Which is complete bullshit because you'll either go on your own or you'll die. Point blank. Or it's "why would i?! Im not leaving." Hmm but then it slowly starts lessening I hardly ever hear from them...and then they're just gone I never hear from them again. To be honest im sick of it...im sick of the hurt it leaves behind. Half Of the people that have left me are ones that I was attached to. Ones that I trusted that I was there for. Yet they're just gone and I'm left with heartache and tears...much like these last few days. I've had two people who I cared about and still do just walk away... And I can already feel the third one leaving.

It sucks ass that I can feel it...but instead of taking your time do it now don't let me get even closer or drag it out. You know I can't leave...I wont. I promised I wouldn't walk away...I don't have it in me too...
