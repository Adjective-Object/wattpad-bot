After their sleepover, next day at school-
Simone's POV
"Do we have to keep it a secret?" I ask
"Yes we do! You know MABYE mermaids are real and we need to keep their existence a secret!" Says Evelyn
"Why?" Asks Aubrey
"Because, scientists will capture them and do experiments on them and put them in cages." She says really fast
"Yea your right, but I would feel guilty if I keep secrets from Audrey and devyn!" I say sadly
"We have too, please don't tell, MABYE if they prove they can keep a secret we can tell them" says Aubrey
"Ok"
In science class
Great! We are working with water! It's a 90% chance I'm gonna get wet! Me, Aubrey and Evelyn are working in a group.
After experiment
"Guys! We did not get wet!" Says Evelyn
"Yea that a good thing" says Aubrey
I see Nathan, he is pouring water into a cup, he starts walking towards me and the others.
"Evelyn, WATER!!" I yell
Nathen slips on water and the water in his cup falls on us, we run out the door, even though the teacher is yelling for us, getting away is more important, we run to the locker room and lock the door. We turn into mermaids.
"This is great" says Evelyn
"Yea! The teacher is gonna freak!" I say
"That's the least of our worries" says Aubrey
I look at my tail
"How are we gonna take showers?" I ask
"Holy cupcakes" says Evelyn
"Ew" says Aubrey
We put our hands up to the tails and dry them up, the bell rings for school to end. Are legs come back and we run back to the classroom and grab our things. The teacher did not see us.
"Eve! Simone! Aubrey!" Says Audrey running to us
"Hello Audrey, where is Devyn?" I ask
"Oh, she is coming, she's in the bathroom" says Audrey
"Ok"
We walk down the hall towards the bathroom, Devyn comes out and she starts walking with us.
After school
"Hey Simone" says my sister Â haru
"Hey" I say walking to my room
