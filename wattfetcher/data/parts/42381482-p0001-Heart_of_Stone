My name is Ava Rose. I'm a second year Gryphindor. Many of my fellow house mates believe me to be in the wrong house. Why? It's because I have made friends with the enemy, Draco Malthoy. The only Gryphindors I do trust are Ginny, and Lily, Harry's long lost twin.
Ginny is the one I trust the most, Lily too. The reason why? They stand up for me. Most people think that Slytherins are bad, well my house is full of pranksters. My bed has been floating, my personal items missing, and other things. I guess being  friends with the Slytherins has a catch.
Anyway today is the biggest and first game of the year. It's Slytherin vs Gryphindor. My house against my friend. I walk up to Slytherins team to wish Draco luck.
"Oh Hi Ava, come to wish me good luck?" Draco said with his signature smirk.
" Yep I also have some info for you. " I said and sat down.
"What? What's Potter planning now?" He said while polishing his Nimbus 2001.
"They have a new plan. The beaters are going to dive in front of Harry so he can like divebomb to get the snitch when he says the code word "gryphin". I figured you'd wanna know." I said.
"Blimey. Thanks for telling me the plan." I turned to leave because I heard the trumpets. "Hey I uh really appreciate you telling me so hears my thanks to you." Then he did something unexpected, he kissed me on the cheek and ran to the Quidditch match.
I stood there for a minute and then ran to the Gryphindor tower for the game. The game was going well until I heard the word 'gryphin'. Harry divebombed the ground and so did Malthoy. Then the Snitch must have gone up because both of them zipped straight up then a ball crashed into them. They were sent plummeting to the ground 50ft below. Lily was screaming and Ron watched like he was frozen in time.
