It hurts so bad when I'm this far away from you I can't see you when your smiling when your laughing  or when your hurting. Sometimes I get so frustrated when I can't see you and I just start crying because all I want is to just see you at least once and give you the biggest hug ever!!! And tell you how much I love you. No one hurts like you babe you feel so much pain that you don't deserve you don't know how hard I wish I could put your problems on me and take them off your shoulders I really love you so much more than words can describe. Your so beautiful â€šsweet and amazing there's non like you I can never replace you no one is as incredible has you. I know at this very moment your hurting and its hurting me cause there's nothing I can do about it and I just feel like I suck like I'm a failure . The only person I love and care for so much is hurting and i can't even reach out to give u a hug. You mean a lot to me and I don't know what i'd do without you I love you always and forever......
