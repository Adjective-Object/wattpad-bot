Lennon has been homeless for three years now. She's lucky if she even makes five dollars a day. And she's beginning to lose all hope. Until five college boys welcome her into their apartment. All of them are happy to have her except one, Harry Styles. But Lennon can't help developing feelings for the punk boy who does anything just to upset her.
Will he feel the same? ___________________________
