Some of us love silence, others hate it.
But really, if you think about it, it's never completely silent.
If you listen hard enough, you can hear some things.
Your breathing, your heart beat, your pulse.
That's why I love silence, because when I do hear it, it's almost like I'm dead.
At least I can pretend when it's silent.....
