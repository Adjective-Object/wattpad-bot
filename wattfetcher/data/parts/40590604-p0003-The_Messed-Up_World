"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Oh sorry if I screamed like a little girl. It's just that when I woke up; there was a graffiti of a rainbow unicorn on my ceiling!
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"
WHY IS THERE A RAINBOW UNICORN ON MY CEILING!? WHO DID THIS!!?
"STOLLS! I'M GONNA KILL YOU!!!" I screamed again. Only they would do such a thing.
I quickly dressed up and rushed out to hunt down the Stolls. But my mind and body had another idea. I don't know why; but I ended up at the infirmary, looking for Will.
He's not there.
I walked around to look for him. Then when I did; I saw a shocking scene.
Will having a picnic with Nyssa. Helping her with her invention. And laughing with her. Having more fun with her than with me.
This is what love is, Nico di Angelo. A voice said. The truth is; this is just another infatuation. And I heard Will himself said he only likes you as a friend. Not any more than that. That girl is who he truly likes.
Those words hurt more than ever. Will didn't even notice me staring at them. That voice was right. Will doesn't like me. I have been rejected. Again.
I ran back to my cabin, and sobbed endlessly on my pillows. Well, it is natural for a person like me to be rejected anyways. Why do I keep falling guys out of my league? Or generally, guys. First was Percy, until I found out he has a girlfriend, is four years older than me, and is my COUSIN!Then Will, who never liked me.
I swear on the River Styx to never fall for someone again. Ever.
"Nico! Nico!"
Someone shook me on my bed. It was Leo.
"What do you want Valdez?"
"Rachel told us a prophecy. It involves you! Come on! Get up! Hurry!"
I reluctantly got up and followed him to the Big House. All the head councilors, Rachel, and some Romans were there.
"Nico, we have received a prophecy." Rachel announced.
Children of death, son of MarsShall retrieve the lost daughter of war.
She will complete a broken OTPThe key to bring peace and make Love happy.
But beware, she swore on the StyxNever to love again, she thinks it's big mistakes.
"Oh." I simply mumbled.
"What can that mean?" Percy asked, being Seaweed Brain.
"Children of death. Nico and Hazel." Annabeth said. "And Frank is the son of Mars."
"So does that mean we have to find Reyna, the lost daughter of war?" Frank asked.
"YAY!" Almost everyone cheered. "Thank the gods!"
"She will complete a broken OTP. What is an OTP?" Hazel asked.
"One True Pairing." Piper answered. "But did Reyna ever fall in love? The OTP must involve her."
"She loves who?" A legionnaire asked.
"NICO!" A voice said. I was shell-shocked. Did I even like her? Sure we went on that quest, but, she likes me????
