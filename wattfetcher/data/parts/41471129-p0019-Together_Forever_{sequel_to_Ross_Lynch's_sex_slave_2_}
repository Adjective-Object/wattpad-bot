Heaven is just soooo cute. She's so young but she's also so talented.It has come to my attention that I'm not replying to most of my comments, a reader of mine was talking to me about this and she thinks it is rude.I am REALLY sorry if that's how you feel but its not that I'm trying to be rude, I just dont have a lot of time. I have exams for two more weeks and I haven't really been on wattpad as ausual as i used to be. I promise that I will try my best to answer all of your comments, forgive me?
Quote or the day : "Fuck you" is the new "thank you" (not really true but that's how it is for my siblings and I)
Question : If you have watched these series shows, then your awesome but if you haven't well then...your missing out...on ALOT. Do you prefer "Penny Dreadful" or..."The Messengers"
My answer = I prefer "The Messengers" cause...its a very interesting show, "Penny Dreadful" is just...too "dreadful" and creepy for me. But not the less, its still an awesome show
