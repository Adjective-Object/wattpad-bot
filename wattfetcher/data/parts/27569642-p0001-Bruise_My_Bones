Jamies Pov.
Mhmm. kay little over here.. Bit to the right.. ah fuck. I ran out of red. I throw the spray can to the floor, moving my hands to my hips, staring at the incomplete mural on the wall.  I run my fingers through my chestnut hair, biting my lower lip, tring to see what else i can do to my mural. I pick up, what i have left of the black spraypaint, and spray over my stencil. The letters spell out "Dream With Your Eyes Open"
Great. I re-adjust my beanie and  hide my cans in my hiding spot. i head back to my mural and see some of the spray dripping. I take my cloth out of my pocket and try to stop it from dripping, as im stopped.
"Hey! You!" Fuck, its the fedz, they'll never take me alive! I throw my skateboard infront of me and run after if, jumping onto it, and directing it away from the cop. I look back, seeing that i lost him, cant be too careful though can i?
"Aw fuck" Again, i land flat on my ass, smooth move Jamie. I stand up, and hear that cop yelling. I kick my skateboard under the table and grab onto some strangers chest, covering mysef with his jacket. He smells goood, and he's so warm.
"You didnt see me" I say into his chest, as i hear the running come closer.
"You didnt happen to see a girl, about yay big, brown hair, on a skateboard?" He asks.                              "No i didnt" He's IRISH?!!                  "Oh okay" Phew, that was close. "Who's this grabbing onto you?" He asks.                                                        "My sister, she collapsed and i'm waiting for my friend to come pick us up"                                              "Shouldnt you take her to hospital?"  "Oh no, she does this all the time, just need to get her home and give er' pills"                                                  "Okay, well, God's bid" I hear footsteps walking away, but they stop suddenly after, whoever this is, calls out after him.                              "No wait, i did she her!" He shouts out to him, fuck, i guess im gonna have to make a run for it.                "She went down there" The footsteps run off into the distance.                  "You can come out now"  I feel my cheeks heat up, i lift the coat off me and look up into his blue orbs... Niall? Niall Horan. I push my self off of him and shuffle to the side sightly. He dosn't want the attention. Act cool.
"Hey, i'm Jamie, you are?" I ask, acting completley oblivious to the situation.                                              "Niall, now hey, you owe me for this"                                                           "Sure, how can i repay you?"
"Let me buy you a coffee" I nod and force a smile, walking side by side to the closest starbucks.
"2 Vanillia Spice Lattes please"  He tells the cashier, my favourite. We recieve our coffees and sit down at a booth. I look down at my drink for several minutes, in deep thought, before drinking it.                             "How come you was running from the police?"                                                 "I do graffiti, how come you was standing by yourself in the cold?          "Supposed to be meeting someone, they could'nt make it"                       "Oh, how old are you?"
"21, you?"
"18, woo im legal" I wave my arms and do a little dance, something coming out of my mouth.
"Nandos!" We both stare at each other for a moment, before bursting out laughing.                                    "Sorry, i'm just really craving nandos" He stands up and waits for me to join him.                                    "Nandos it is"
"Lets play 21 Questions" He says while we wait for our food. "Full name?"
