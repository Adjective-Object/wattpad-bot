"It's not ______, aru." China said.
"Huh? What?! A zoo? A world zoo?!Do not touch or feed the nations?!" Spain concluded excitedly.
France shook his head in disbelief. "I can't believe it... Is he for real?"
Spain snapped out of his amazement, "Oh, I just remembered! By the way, don't you guys have a ladder or anything like that? Roma--"
"Spain!!! Open this cell!!!!" Germany cut him off loudly.
"Ack...! Wh-what? What do you mean? I mean, didn't Ita come this way?" Spain asked them.
Japan motioned at the cell door. "We'll explain the situation later!! Just open this cell first!! Please!!"

On their way to the tunnel were the rope ladder was, Prussia turned to Spain.
"By the way, have you seen a frau walking around on your way here?"
"Huh?"
"You see...there's also this young girl who unfortunately ended up trapped here, as well..."
"R-Really? A chica..."
"Yeah...she has (hair colour) hair and (eye colour) eyes..."
Spain snapped his fingers. "OH! Uhm, isn't she with Ita?"
"What?"
"They had their backs turned at me, but I saw her being carried by Ita.  I didn't even get to call out to them because I suddenly heard some clashing in the room near me. So I entered it and found you guys."
"M-Maybe Italy wanted to lock her up somewhere, too?"
"That must be the case. For now, let's go to the tunnel with the rope ladder."
"Agreed."

-*-*-*-First Floor, Outside door to basement-*-*-*-
"First I'll look for another metal piece. I remember where it's hidden... and if I look for them one by one, maybe I'll remember more." Italy told himself.
Italy heads up to the lower right room on the second floor. Little did he know...that he was being watched.
-*-*-*-Second Floor, Fireplace Room-*-*-*-
Luciano, Flavio, Matt, and Allen were in the fireplace room, waiting for Kuro and the others to give the signal that 1P Italy was going inside the room across them.
"So, what did the Kuro guy say?" Allen turned to Luciano.
The auburn haired Italian placed his phone back in his pocket. "He's on his way upstairs. How about your pet?"
"Hey. He's my buddy, get your shit straight. He's already positioned above the room across us, so that he could just pounce on the little bitch later."
Flavio blankly stared the fireplace. "Hey...Luci..."
"What the fuck? Don't call me that." Luciano snapped.
The older brother brushed it off and continued, "What do you think of the girl...you know..what she said earlier..? What if... what if she's right? What if we could just--"
Luciano shot a glare at Flavio. "--Don't give me that shit, Flavio. She's probably just...brainwashing us or something. Heck, maybe she just made that up so she could talk us out of our plans! If we gave her the chance to choose between us and those 'First Player' bastards, of course she'll choose them and not us! She doesn't care about us. No one does."
