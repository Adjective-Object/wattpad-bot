It's never too late to be forgiven, because as long as we are humans, we won't be perfect. As long as Satan exists inside us, he will keep seducing us until we fall.
So ... Hijab, loose clothes, prayers, Qur'aan, Istighfaar and Jannah?Or, Makeup, short skirts, bikinis, clubs, Beer and Hell?
I want Jannah.
I just have to find the way back to the right path.
.......
So ?
....
The moment you've been waiting for has finally come.
