Umm...Yea.Hi.____________------------------_________Dani's POV      There was an emergency meeting for The Authority and let me just say it has to be good because I had to leave in the middle of my workout.
Once I arrived, I saw Colby and I prayed he didn't notice me. See, I haven't talked to him ever since the day when we kissed. It been awkward seeing him at work and not saying anything to each other.
But anyways I started to walk into the arena as I was going in I stopped to take pictures with fans and then a girl asked if she could take a picture with me and Colby since he was kinda close, she asked him to come take a picture with us and he did. We each said goodbye to the girl and I started to walk away he grabbed my hand and I blushed really hard.
We walked to the office, together, hand in hand....WOW...I could die.But it wasn't bad. When we got there we walked in and took our seats next.to.each.other. We haven't said a word to each other. we just sat there holding hands.WOW I REPEAT I COULD JUST DIE.
Steph's POV
I see that Dani and Colby have been getting really close and I don't have no problem with it. The would be the best power couple ever. We besides me and Hunter.
"Okay.we called you guys here to say that today is the day that the Authority and Dani storyline with start...."
