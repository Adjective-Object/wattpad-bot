"I should've came faster" Simon's voice broke.
Note: Simon is the man between these chickens.
"It's not your falt" Damon knelt beside him.
I opened my eyes a bit "D-damon" I spoke weakly.
"What happened, who is that bastard" I saw his eyes getting watery.
"I wish you came earlier" I closed my eyes.
"I'll call the police and hospital" William said. I'm surprised.
"NO" Peter said.
I stood up "TOM, Wallah if the ketchup stays on my clothes you'll buy me new ones" I said, Tom and Peter burst out laughing.
"What is going on" Simon asked.
"HAHA IF Y-YOU COULD SEE YOU- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOUR FACES" Tom laughed.
"And I thought you finally became a man" I scolded Damon then went to the kitchen to drink water.
"Was that a joke" Simon asked angrily.
"Calm down man, yes it is" Peter said.
"I WAS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY ! ARE YOU CRAZY" Simon shouted.
"Calm down. Sorry it didn't go the exact way we wanted it to, but least we found out who the real man is, which is you, Thank you Simon because you were ready to risk your life to save me" I said, the girls were still shocked and silent.
"I knew it was a joke" Jake lied.
"Oh please ? If you ever ever again try to talk to me or touch me, I'll take your heart of your chest, same thing for Damon" I said harshly.
"You scared the he'll out of us" Elina finally spoke.
"especially the boys" Diana said.
"I- I was about to-" Damon said but I cut him off.
"Oh please ? now you're trying to impress me ha? make sure that if I was close to be your friend, I never will be after what happened today, chicken" I said.
"I still cannot believe you" Simon said angrily.
"Calm down it's Okay now" Diana placed her hand on Simon's biceps.
"Take your hands off me. Please" He said politely.
"Put the gun back please" I said and he did as he was told, I felt Diana tense a bit.
"Elina I-" Jake tried to explain.
"Pshhhhhhht, William hates me but at least he was going to call the police, thank you William but I still hate you" I said.
"Same" William said.
