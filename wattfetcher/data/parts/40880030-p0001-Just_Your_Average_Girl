You know that one person you never thought you'd be with? The one who seemed to be the complete opposite of you? Well like they say, opposites do attract. But I've been caught up with so many other guys who have totally took advantage of me and made me come to the conclusion, they weren't right for me. But He is different, he's that good kid in school who doesn't care what other people say. Well, not exactly 'good' just better than others. Man, I wish I could do that, all I do is worry about how other people think about me. Me and Justin have known each other since we were 5, or at least that's as far as I can remember. Just this year, I began to notice we had a lot in common. This is because i began close friends with his friend Nathaniel and he always talked about him. I thought it was just cool how he and I were so alike. He had watched me go on and date other people and acted as if nothing had gone through his mind about me. My friend Melody began to like Nathaniel. Nathaniel began to like her back. Next thing I knew, they were dating. And so was i, not Justin though. I was dating William. I had only known him for a month before we went out and things had escalated quickly. After a month, I got back to my senses and broke up with this stranger I thought I had been my love. I began talking to talking to Melody and Nathaniel, they were the power couple who were also my best friends. They had my back through everything.
Nathaniel was talking to Justin one night and Nathaniel was told by Justin himself that he had liked me. Well of course I liked him! I have had a crush on him since the beginning of sixth grade. After a few days, me and Justin began texting each other about random topics and that was it for the day. Then, out of the blue, he asked me if I wanted to go with him on a field trip we were having at the school. I said "Sure!" and that was that. I wonder how much further this will go.. well I know, do you?
