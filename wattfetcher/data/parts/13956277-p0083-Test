I'm so so so so sorry for not updating for so long. I'm really busy because of school and examinations, I cannot wait for the winter vacation. I'm also sorry for not being able to make this chapter longer than 5 pages, I really didn't have time.
Unedited.
Alhamdulillah, I knew the way home so I went to it after I got offended because of my stylish outfit, but it's not a solution to punch everyone who insults me, sometimes you need to ignore them because If you give them any simple reaction it might get worse. I searched for Hannah to give her back her bag but I couldn't find her.
I walked to the house slowly thinking about everything. Was it a smart decision to come here ? I was living back there in Jordan peacefully and happily, Was it fair to leave my parents ? I'm their only child, I was supposed to stay with them and never leave. Maybe I should've thought twice before leaving. But I wanted this so bad, I wanted responsibility, to be free, to do whatever I want. Now, it doesn't matter if it was a smart decision or not because the axe has fallen into the head (it's an Arabic proverb) . Huff, I was there having fun without getting hate or being bullied, I didn't need to punch anybody because I had everybody's respect.
I shook my head in an attempt to remove these thoughts and think of something else but all I managed to think of was Hannah.
Why did she have praying clothes & carpet with her ? Is she ... ? No, I don't think so .. But what if she is ? why is she hiding it ? Maybe because she doesn't want to face what I face everyday ? What if-
"Beeep Beeeep" A horn interrupted my thoughts, "Get in" I saw Simon waving at me "I'm talking to you" He said, "Hey, come on, The Carter's house is close" Molly said, "What ! You told her !" I frowned, "I'm sorry she tricked me" He smiled, Is it too hot and is the sun too close or is Simon's smile too perfect ? and are Â his eyes too ? maybe his nose either ? I'm a freak, who likes noses !
"Uhh umm, I was asleep and then ...", "Then what ?" I crossed my arms over my chest, "She's my twin I swear it seems like she can read my mind", "Yeah I can *Whispers* He talks in his sleep" I giggled "Okay, gotta go now, bye".
I threw myself on my bed immediately, I felt my phone vibrate but I fell asleep ...
"LEEENAAA WAKE UP IT'S ALMOST 6" I felt pain hit my stomach but I knew the reason as soon as I opened my eyes; Ms.Carter thought that it'd be so fun to jump on my stomach since she thinks the's lighter than a feather, "I'm going to vomit" Those words were enough to push her away, I opened my phone and saw some new texts from a private number,
Morning babe,Be careful from Conor and Miley, S.A (secret admirer) cool ha ? 7:00 am.
Don't set on your desk, S.A 7:50 am.
I'll make him pay back, S.A 9:36 am.
Wake up darling If you don't want to be fired, S.A 3:00 pm.
"WHAT DO YOU WANT !" I shouted, "What's wrong ?", "Nothing Elina, nothing" My phone vibrated again, new text : I want you, S.A 5:55 pm.
"SCREW YOU !!!" I panicked, "What ? who is it !" Elina grabbed my phone, "He's watching and listening" I whispered in fear, My phone vibrated again, Open your closet, you didn't think I was gonna let you walk around naked ha ? What you did to the girls in the orphan was nice though, but don't go there again. Now go to your work, S.A 5:57 pm.
"This is serious, you got a stalker", "The orphanage ! My work ! Nina ! I'm too late".
