"i don't think I could take you serious like that."
"like what?"
"when you're cross faded"
"haha why not?"
"bc you aren't in a good place to speak about how much you like me, for all i fucking know you're probably just trying to get in my pants."
"why all of a sudden ask me this?"
"bc im confused okay! you kiss me but don't ask me out then you're making out with other girls.."
i get up and leave, i hear him calling my name but i just keep walking. nate grabs my arms and kisses me to where it hurts and he doesn't stop.
i dont want him too. i want him, i fucking want all this. all of him but he pisses me off so much and i hate it.
theres something about him that drives me crazy and i want all of him.
"im sorry. okay. you deserve so much more then me, im sorry and i dont wanna keep hurting you. we shouldnt see eachother anymore."
he just walks away and leaves me speechless. i start to cry, im lost for words, he fucking left me. alone.
