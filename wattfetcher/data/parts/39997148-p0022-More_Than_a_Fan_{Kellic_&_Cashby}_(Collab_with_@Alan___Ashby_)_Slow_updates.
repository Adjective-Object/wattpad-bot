He nodded, "I did."
"That's good. Can I see?"
"Sure, come here."
I got up and moved to sit next to him looking over his shoulder looking at the pictures.
"I really like this one." He told me.
"Really? Why?" I asked looking at it.
"I don't know. I like the colors and how it's all balanced out. Its a great picture of Phil."
"Yeah it looks even better than the actual Phil." I said laughing a little.
"Hey!" Phil said, "You're a dick."
I nodded, "I know."
"He has a point." Tino said laughing with me.
"Here's a good one of Tino." Alan said.
"That one looks really cool too." I said.
"Yeah. I have to look through Pierce's photos then download these on my computer and do a bunch of boring stuff. So I'll, uh, be in my bunk." Â He said and stood up.
"Alright goodnight dude!" I said as he walked back to the bunks.
"I say you're trying too hard." Tino said, "Like man he is so not interested in you."
I scoffed, "Whatever."
"Come on Aust, you know it! It's been like not even two days and you can tell he doesn't have an interest in you."
"He's just playing hard to get." I said, "I mean he's totally into me."
"No, he's really not. He just got out of relationship, he obviously sees you as a friend and that's it." Phil said, "I mean he's not playing anything. He just met you anyway."
"Well then I'll just be his friend until he decides that we're great together." I said.
"You're in denial Aust." Aaron said.
I rolled my eyes, "I'm not in denial, now I'm going to bed."
"Whatever you say." Tino said, "Goodnight."
"Night." I said getting up and heading to the bunks.
I got back to the bunks and Alan looked out at me, "Hey."
"Hey." I said and climbed up into my bunk, "Having fun with your pictures?"
"Yeah I am. Its a lot of work though."
"What are you doing to them?"
"Downloading them to my computer then editing some then probably posting some, then sending a few to my professor."
"Sounds cool."
"Oh its the greatest." He said, "Are you going to bed?"
"More like just avoiding the guys."
"Oh, why?" He asked curious.
"Nothin you need to worry your pretty little head about."
"Pretty?" He asked blushing a little.
"Yeah, pretty."
"Oh thanks."
"No problem." I said.
"Did you ever go to college?" He asked randomly.
"No." I said putting my hands behind my head.
"Oh, why not?"
"I didn't feel like it was for me, why?"
