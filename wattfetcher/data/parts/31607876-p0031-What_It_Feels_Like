To you
Whoever you are
Wherever you might be
You are beautiful
And wonderful
And smart
And funny.
Anyone who doesn't see this is a fucking asshole who doesn't deserve to be in your life.
You do not deserve whatever happened to you. You are a great person and there is a reason you are still alive today.
Despite whatever you might think, there is someone out there who loves you and will miss you when you're gone.
Never stop. Up until this moment, you've never lost. Maybe a few battles here and there but you're still winning the war. And you can do it. I believe in you. You can do it.
I love you.
Please, if you need someone to talk to I'm always here. And don't forget, there is a free national hotline that allows your calls to be completely anonymous.
Stay strong.
