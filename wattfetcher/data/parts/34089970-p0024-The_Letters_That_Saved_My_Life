After walking under a tree Thomas looked over at me.
"I have some things that I should tell you." He states as I nod my head for him to continue.
"I knew of your mothers death right after you left. You kept to yourself, you pushed me away. Then you leave without any explanation. Robin, I-"
"I'm so, so sorry for not telling you..." I whisper as I wipe away a tear.
"I missed you so much it hurt. The only reason I knew where you had gone to was because of Hunter." My confusion multiples at his words.
"What does Hunter have to do with anything?"
"He is my cousin. He told me of a new student at his school, I knew it was you. It had to be..." Thomas whispers the last part as he looks at me. His warm hands cup my cheeks as he leans in.
"Hey love birds! Hurry up, I don't want to be late for lunch!" Katie yelled from the doors of the school. A laugh escapes my mouth as we pull away.
"Nothing can get in between Katie and her food..." I mutter as we walk back inside the loud school. After we get our lunches we sit at our normal table.
"So are you guys, like a thing now?" Katie asks me as I start blushing.
"I'll take that blush as a yes..."
"What are you blushing about, Robin??" Derrick asks as he walks up to our lunch table.
"Robin an-" Katie licks my hand that covers her mouth.
"Ew, are you kidding me Katie?!"
I only got an evil smile in response.
"Anyways...." Derrick said before he started eating. Hunter walked up and sat next to Derrick. I looked at him and mouthed.
'Tell him.'
'No!'
'Yes!'
'Nope'
'No.'
'Yes.'
"Hahahahaha." I start laughing as Hunter gives me a dirty look.
"You tricked me!"
"How did Robin trick you?" Derrick asks as Hunter looks at me and mouths.
'I hate you...'
"Sh-, never mind!" Hunter replied.
"I am so confused...." Derrick muttered as he shook him head.
"You traveled through time to be with me. Only to fine, I had gone back to look for you. Both a one-way ticket." ~Unknown
