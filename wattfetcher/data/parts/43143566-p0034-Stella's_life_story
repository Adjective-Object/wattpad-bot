getting out of the shower i put on a bath robe and headed downstares for i was hungrey..i was greeted by seing dad.
we talked for a muinet but he went into the living room where bryan got sucked ino playing that annoying pinball game..making some ramin to eat while i was waiting for the water to boil i ate the last of the chocolate cake...
'I'm going to have to puke that up later...'i thought to myself as i threw away the empty container.
eating the ramen i went into the living room..,"Can you stop slurping like a total retard?"bryan asked making me feel worse in myself.
i so badly wanted to say'i know don't worry ill be gone soon enough'as i tried my best to ignore him i couldn't.
,"agh so much swag!"he said as he got a multi ball.,"yah its too bad your not winning."i stifled a laugh.i'm surprised he didn't say anything like 'kill yourself kris.'
he has no idea how much i hear that..even if he did know i doubt he would care..he's even got the voices in my head saying that me me.mother knows that has been said to me before but she never stops Bry from saying it..
the whole time i was down stares she hasn't said anything to me..it was like everyone in the room didn't want me there and dad was just the viewer that didn't want to do anything about it..whatever..i went up stares and started listening to more music as i worked on my story...thats all
i can't seem to be able to do anymore..but hey,am i complaining?no.to other people they've got it worse than me..I'm just this waist of space that can't do anything for herself
