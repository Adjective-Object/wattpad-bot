Sometimes all we can see is black, white, and grey. Nothing at all sometimes.
And that's when we decide that we're done being color blind.
We make a new color, in some way, in any way.
For some, they make their colors with music, art, theater, writing,Â  photography, working out. Things like that.
For others, it's not quite that simple. We make colors with pills, knifes, razors, lighters, bruises, cuts, scratches, burns. Some of us make our color with our own blood.
I was so tired of being color blind that I made a new color for my eyes to see... Blood red.
