"So, you're sleeping over ?" I asked, "Of course I am *pause* let's get something to eat" She opened my mini fridge and pulled some chocolate.
My phone rang as we were playing twister, "Answer it" Zainab said, "No ! I will lose if I move, you answer it" I chuckled, "Left hand blue" Zainab said, "NOOO" I laughed out loud as I struggled to put my hand on the closest blue circle which was right under Zainab's butt, "Move it away" I chuckled, "Use the other blue circle" She said while laughing, I tried my best to to reach it and when I did, Zainab collapsed and fell over me, "No ! You're squashing me, Get up" I struggled for air then she finally stood up and picked my phone, "Oh, Simon" She said and winked at me, "Give it to me" I commanded , "No" She said and ran to the bathroom then locked the door, "Hello sexy beast, what's going on" She said on the phone, "No ! Shut up" I laughed, Zainab lowered her voice, "Open the freaking door !" I said loudly but ..Â  This is Zainab, you can't command Zainab ! "I LOVE YOU, COME HERE AT 10 PM, I'LOL BE WAITING FOR YOU", "No ! Zainab shut up" I was angry but laughing my laungs out at the same time.
Zainab came out, "He wants to talk to you" Zainab said, I snapped the phone from her hand, "Hi..." I said calmly, "Hi, uh.. I called to say.. uh *pause* From the moment I met you, I knew you were the one, I tried my best to get you, I got myself into fights to win your heart, and now, you finally feel the same about me, and I'm sorry for what I said earlier, and I know you need me the most now, and I'll stick beside you", "Uh Oh No Simon I love you kiss me" Zainab said, I pushed her off the bed and I heard Simon's attractive laugh, "But what I fear the most is that your feelings might be bumping into each others and you're mistaking and mixing between need, friendship, and love ... I don't want you to -", "Shut up Simon, I'm in love with you ! Friendship doesn't get you butterflies in your stomach" I said and Zainab exploaded in laughter with Simon in sync, "Open your window" Simon said, Zainab heard him and ran to the window then opened it, A mini helicopter was flying in circles in front of my window, there was a basket hanging from a rope tied around the helicopter, "Look, there's Simon holding the remote control" Zainab said as she was waving at Simon, I walked to my closed to pull a hijab and wrap it around my head then headed to the window. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" Karam ran out after Simon, Simon ran away while giggling, the mini helicopter fell on the grass, I ran to get it but the door of my bedroom was locked, Karam came back and crashed the helicopter with the basket and tore what was in it. Karam glared at me and Zainab, he got into the house and broke into my room, Karam ran toward me and pulled my hair, "Listen to me, I can crash your bones and pull your eyelashes one by one if you don't get back to your mind" He threatened, I kept my mouth shut then he pushed me and locked the door behind him. My eyes lightened in anger, "He'll regret it" I made my hair in a ponytail, "What are you going to do?" Zainab asked in fear, she knew how I behave when I get angry.
"Got it?" I asked Zainab after I had told her the full plan, I open the door using a knife after we make sure Karam is asleep, she sneaks out the room and turns the electricity off, so the cameras and security system don't work, then we'll sneak out
"Simon, meet me at Starbucks, I'm out" I said then got in my car with Zainab beside me.
Day by day, everything was getting worse, except my relationship with Karam, I fixed it, but I ruined everything else. My relationship with Simon got stronger
"Karam", "Yes", "You know that manners matter more than looks, right?" I asked as I gave him some strawberries, "Yeah sure", "I want to take off my hijab" I said, Karam coughed, "Are you serious?", "Yes I am ! I made my decision, I want to live my life fully, and I want to be free and do whatever I want, I'm still young, there's a long life waiting for me" I explained, "You know I'm not as religious as your parent were, and I won't mind, but don't take a decision you might regret in the future, plus, freedom isn't about the clothes", "I want this", "Listen, you're an adult now, you're 18, and even if I disagree, you will do what you want, just think about it"
