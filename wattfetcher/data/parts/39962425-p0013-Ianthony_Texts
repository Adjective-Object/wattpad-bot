I: Hey Anthony? What would you say if I accidentally set your bed on fire by trying to use your straightener?
A: Why do you ask?
I: Just a rhetorical question.
A: I don't know. I guess I would ask if you and Pip were okay.
I: You wouldn't care about your bed being ruined?
A: I could sleep on the couch, or in your bed with you, so it doesn't really matter, does it?
I: I guess not...
I: But I need to tell you something.
A: ?
I: I mighta kinda sorta set your bed on fire with your hair straighteners , but me and Pip are okay.
A: I had a theory.
I: You aren't mad?
A: If I was mad, I would be calling you right now and confronting you about using my things without my persmision and setting my bed on fire, but i'm not mad at all.
I: Because you love me?
A: Yes. And because now I have an excuse to cuddle with you all the time.
I: You're a dork ;p
A: But i'm your dork. ;P
I: Unfortunately. :*
