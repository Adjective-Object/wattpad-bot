So if any of my fellow readers are major whovians, (like me) then you probably get super frustrated when one of these things happen.
So just the other day i was talking with my friend and...
Me: (ranting about someone who offended DW)
friend: what's doctor who?
Me: ...
Me: ...
Me: ...
Friend: whatever, but i was just BLABLABLABLABLABLA
and i was just sitting, there, wondering if she was listening to a WORD i ws saying, because i literally just explained DW
And this is only ONE of the manymanymanymany reasons that DW has ruined and saved my life.
