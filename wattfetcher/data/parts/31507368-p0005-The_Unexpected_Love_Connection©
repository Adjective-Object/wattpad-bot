He takes an unexpected picture, hurting our eyes from the flash.
"Oh yes, you guys are ready. Showtime! Chop! Chop!" The man skipped off the set.
"This will be interesting."
"Yeah, totally," Justin replies.

I can't tell if she's flirting with me or not but it feels like it. The way she gives me more attention than Lance actually leaves me to suspicion. It is either that or I'm just trying to make it seem that way since I lov-like her. Just like. I am in like with her--if that's even a thing.

Is it weird for me to think that Justin is flirting with me? I mean, I don't mind since I get it all the time but, is it? Should I just ignore it? It wouldn't even matter anyway since I don't want to date. Besides, he doesn't seem like the kind of guy to go out with a girl like me. It's just kind of confusing but I should just shake it off.

Justin's P.O.V
I had a great time during the photshoot. We was just goofing off and being silly like regular young kids. The gear and everything was tight too. The three of us did an interview afterwards discussing the amount of fun we had.

Lance approaches me from aside, placing his elbow on my shoulders. My blue eyes meet his.
"Enjoyed yourself," he teases.
"Yep. Dude, do you think Aaliyah likes me? You know, the photshoot and all?" I ask anxiously.
Lance says, "Are you serious right now? She was suppose to give us that attention. That is what the photographer wanted. Besides, your noodle hair just ruins your chance with a goddess like that."
"You're probably right," I doubt, swinging my foot side to side. My band mate gives me an assuring look.
"But I bet you can get those digits. That'll at least put you in the FRIENDZONE," he promises, nudging my arm.
I deny, "Oh hell no dude. Now you know what happened with Britney. I forbid to be another woman's puppet. That is a total line which I'm never crossing again."
I have to throw that line. With Britney, she made me do everything and I didn't even at least hit it! It took me til the fifth month to get into a relationship with her. She made me wait a whole year just to get into those pants too. A guy like me can't wait that damn long.
"I'm sorry bro, I just can't get her phone number and then end up in the friend- the fri- the frien- I can't even say it!"
"Then ask her out!"
"No!"
"Yes!"
"No!"
"Yes!"
"No!"
"I'm not listening to you. I'm calling her over," Lance shouts. "Aaliyah! Aaliyah! Justin needs to talk to you! Over here!"
