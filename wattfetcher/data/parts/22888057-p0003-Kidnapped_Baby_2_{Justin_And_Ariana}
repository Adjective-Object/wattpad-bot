He puts me back down and doesn't miss my lips this time.
Our lips move in sync as I pull him closer to me.
He breaks away and leans his forehead against mine.
"Together?"He asks.
"Forever"I answer.
We've been saying that for awhile now.
"Hey can we get some pop..."Chaz comes in and stops mid sentence once he notices us in our daze.
"Sorry"He apologizes.
"It's ok, you wanted popcorn?"I ask.
"The kids wanted popcorn actually"He says.
"Oh ok, I'll bring some out"I say.
He walks out leaving me and Justin again.
"I'll make it"I say.
"No it's ok, I'll make it, go back to the movie"He says.
I peck him real quick before walking back out.
"Ariana!"I look to see Jazzy and Jaxon running towards me.
I let them into my arms, giving them a huge bear hug.
They've grown big too.
"Hey Ariana"I look up at Jeremy and give him and Erin a hug.
They hand me Sophia's present and go to get some food.
I put the gift away and I sit with my mom while everyone else sits in there own spots in the living room.
Justin soon comes back out with popcorn and hands it all out.
He then comes to sit with me and I snuggle closer to him.
Soon Elsa's part comes on where she begins to sing let it go.
All the kids begin singing. Especially Sophia, who feels the need to stand up to sing her part.
"Let it go!
Let it go!
Can't hold it back anymore!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Turn my back and slam the door!
Here I stand!
And here I"ll stay!
Let it go!
Let it go!
The cold never bothered me anyways!"The kids all sing.
{Later that night}
Me and Justin tuck Sophia and Isabelle into bed. They both share a room since Isabelle is still scared to sleep by herself.
Once their all tucked, I stuff Sophia's new toys in her toy chest.
"What do we do every night?"Justin asks the girls.
"Pray!"Sophia answers.
We all gather hands and Sophia prays.
"I thank The Lord for this bright day,
Parents, food, sleep, and play.
Let us have sweet dreams.
Amen"She says.
