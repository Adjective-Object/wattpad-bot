Prussia faced me with a grin. "Thank you so much, frau, but you don't need to stress yourself out too much for us. You know, you have to think about yourself, too."


"......Myself...?" I asked softly. Then all too suddenly, I remembered something.


No... Why the hell did I forget such a thing...??


Look at me talking big like that in front of them...


Look at me talking about how I'm going to help them...


Look at me...


....This time I...


.....I'm  the one feeding them with lies.



But....I haven't taken the metal piece yet, right?


So--


......No!


.....I need to take it.


Not for myself, but for...my parents.


I just need to take the metal piece and give it to the 2Ps so that they'll set my parents free, right? .... After that, I don't care what those 2Ps will do to kill the 1Ps, but I'm going to help the 1Ps get out of this mansion. I won't allow those Second Players to kill the First Players for revenge... The metal piece might be a way to escape this mansion, but I'm sure there are other ways besides that...


The Second Players...


....I've considered them. Their situation, their feelings, their pasts...


...But I still can't accept how they want to handle their anger at the First Players.


I know there's still a chance for them to change...so there's this possibility of talking things out with them, right?


I'll worry about that bit later...


...for now, I have to work out how I'm going to take the metal piece without them knowing...
