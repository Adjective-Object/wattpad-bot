Lucas's Pov (It will be mostly his pov. this story is mostly about him)

Ugh. I can't believe my mum is making me move AGAIN. Like, this is NOT my home. Nowhere is my home, except for Texas. But whatever. Like I care where I belong. All that ever happens is where ever I move, girls chase me, detention, suspension. But the only good thing is that I get all A's. Don't know why. Don't know how. But it doesn't matter. If I get good grades, the faster I will be out of school.
When I said that girls chase me. They do! Especially the popular girls. It gets annoying. But I deny all of them. I'm not a player. Never! I do have a heart. I'm not the grinch.
So I moved, and I have to stay here. Rawr. But whatever. I wont get any friends. "LUCAS! GET YOUR FUCKING ASS DOWN HERE. YOUR GONNA BE LATE!" My mother yells. I hate my mother. She curses, and drinks, and.. Shes a bad woman. Ever since she divorced 2 years ago shes been like this. How I HATE her so much..
I grab my bag, and I walk to my new school. It IS the beginning of the year. I walk inside and since I already have my schedule and locker number, I don't need to waste my time going to the attendance office.
On the way to my homeroom class, I hear a faint cry. It's from a girl. Fine. I walk to where it is and it's in a corner with a girl with brown wavy hair crying her eyes out. I am curious to what happened. So I tap her soft, shoulder and she looks up. My heart then melts. Why?
"Hey.. Shh.. Shh.. It's okay.. Don't cry.." I say puling her to my side snuggling her in my arm. "M-Missy pu-punched me. And m-my best fr-friend took h-her side.." She cries out. I rub her back as she cries on my shoulder. "Do you have any other friends?" I ask. She shakes her head. She doesn't? Wow.
"I will be your friend." I say. She smiles. I can feel my heart melt. What is happening to me? Am I in love? No! It can't be. "Thanks. But I can't be your friend. I don't know your name yet." She says. I laugh. "Lucas." I say. "Riley." She replies. I love her name. "Nice name." I compliment. She blushes. "Thanks. You too." She replies. Have I found the one for me?
