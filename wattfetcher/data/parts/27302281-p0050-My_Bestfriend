About a week later
" justin  baby are you hungry " kylie mom asked apprroching me
" no  " I said annoyed  but tried to hide it
" justin you need to eat  you haven't left  her side   for a least a week you stink  and you look skinny and pale I'll stay with her  your mom brought u some clothes  you can shower in  the connected bathroom "  she said handing me clothes and everything else I needed
" promise me if she wakes up  u will let me know "  I said   looking away from kylie  then looking at her mom
" of course"she said
Then I let go of Kylie's hand and  kissed it softly   and whispered
"I'll be right back I promise"
Then I walked off to shower and   clean my self up when I got in the bathroom I   looked in the mirror and  believed what she had said cause she was right I look Like a wreck I have bags under my eyes plus man do I stink ewwww. I thought stripping of my clothes  and hopping in the shower and letting the warm water hit my face  I then washed my hair with the stuff kylie mom gave me  strawberry shampoo  great I'm gonna smell like strawberries   oh well its better than my pervious smell  I  hurried up to finish the rest of my shower then hopped out and  dried off then threw my clothes and   fixed my hair a bit with the blow dryer tht kylies mom had given me and   shaved the hair on my face that was coming the surface    once I was done I gave my self a good look in the mirror then put everything up in a bag that   kylies mom  had given me  and   walked out the bathroom   then I set everything down and turned to  Kylie's mom
I'm gonna go downstairs and get something to eat  I'm starving
I turned away starting walking towards the door
Justin I heard a sweet voice say  which I knew by heart so I jerked by head around I bolted in that direction
Yes Kylie baby I'm here I said stroking her face softly making sure it didn't hurt her
I have some much to tell you  sweetie  I said softly  kissing her head softly
I'm going to get some food  I'll be right back okay would you like something  I cooed
yeah  chips and ice cream  and some water  she said trying to sit up
" I got her now go justin" Shannon spoke up
Justin POV
I left the room smiling to myself  and headed down to the cafeteria and grabbed something to eat  when I ran into the last person I  though I would see
" hey justin how are you"  she said innocently
" good " I answered shocked to see her standing here just the thought she was back make me shiver
" so are you visiting family here or "  she asked
" I'm here with my girlfriend she got in an accident about a week ago and she just awoke from a  coma " I said which made her tense right when I said the word girlfriend
" so u have a girlfriend now " she said offensively hurt a bit
" yeah not long after you left without a goodbye or a number" I said slightly annoyed by her  question as if she thought I would wait for her
" ok " she said
" look I'm sorry  I shouldn't have went off on you "  I apologized
"  its fine " she said pulling out a wadd of cash and paying for her food then I did the same  we sat together to catch we talked for what seem like hours before it dawned on me ... Kylie  she wanted cookies and ice cream  and some water crap
