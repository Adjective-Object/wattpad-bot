Sebastian's eyes turned pink as he seductively smirked at me. My (E/C) eyes widened. They.... turned pink?
"Is something troubling you, (F/N)?" Sebastian asked.
I simply stared in fear as his eyes returned to its burning red color. He continued to smirk as he cocked his head to the side, causing his midnight black hair to fall into his face.
"Stop teasing her." Ciel said in monotone.
The butler finally stopped staring. "Of course, master."I looked outside the carriage windows and pondered my sanity.
Did that really happen?
Does Ciel know that his eyes change color?
Is he... one of those... monsters that I've been warned about?
All of those thoughts ran through my head.
Damn butler. I just got lucky! I can't ruin it by losing grip of my sanity!
At some point in my thoughts, I fell asleep. I smelled something sickeningly sweet before I did however... strange.
-Time-Skip------------------------
"Nnng... ugh." I groaned.
I cracked my eyes open and quickly noticed that I was no longer in the carriage.
Instead, I was in a large black metal cage. Ew... MY clothing was different as well.
The dress was tight and was way higher than my knees. Who did this to me? Whoever did is clearly perverted.
"Finally awake? You looked beautiful as you slept, my sweet robin.~"
