Luke: You and Luke make Mac and Cheese but you buy dough to make breadsticks as well. You tell him to hold one up and smile so you can post a picture on Twitter to the fans. You post the picture and say to Luke,"Best date night ever with this breadstick!" Due to Luke's Childress the both of you end up building a fort and falling asleep underneath the same sky.
Michael: You and Michael make pizza for dinner. While the pizza is cooking you and Michael have a dance session and forget that the pizza is cooking. After almost burning the house you order pizza for the both of you to stay home and watch movies.
Calum: You and Calum both make a mini Taco station because who doesn't love tacos. You both end up throwing the left over toppings at each other and watch Monsters Inc. because that is your favorite movie and you just love disney.
Ashton: You and Ashton made spaghetti but messed up a few times because Ashton would keep giggling and poking your sides. You decided to stop making it and order some take out and watch a few movies.â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…A/n: Hi this is my first 5SOS preference I hope you all enjoyed it.
