"Dad..." I gave out a small chuckle.
I went back inside to get my bag. Then I remembered something.
My laptop!
Of all the things to forget =.=
I rushed upstairs wearing my bag. It wasn't heavy, anyway. As I went inside my room, I saw my laptop was on my bed. "Silly me. Sorry I almost forgot about you, my dear laptop~" I cooed.
I sat on my bed and placed my laptop in my bag. When I got up, I felt...woozy.
I suddenly felt weak and my vision was getting blurry. What's happening?
But all too soon, the weird feeling faded away and I was feeling back to normal. This is unexplainable, really..
"_______! C'mon, dear, we need to go now!" My father shouted.
"I'll be right there!" I called back.
I went out of my room. Before going downstairs, I turned to face my room again.
"See you soon, oh splendid isolation hub of mine~" I said. As I was about to step down a stair.. I heard a faint voice.
"I don't think you will, ragazza~"
