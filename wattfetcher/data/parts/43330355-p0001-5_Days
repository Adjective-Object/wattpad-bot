I couldn't move I felt like shit.I couldn't move I felt like crap.I couldn't move I felt like DEATHHer name is Anna and this is her story.
MONDAYI woke up had a shower and went downstairs to eat some leftovers from my mum and dads takeaway last night, my dad (Josh) came down stairs looking drunk as usual "what the fuck are you staring at worthless whore" he said as he punched me in the gut, causing me to fall to the floor in pain, I couldn't say anything I never have been able to since that day...The day that my sister Kelly committed suicide I cried for weeks, I tried to kill myself once or twice, maybe even three times, before my mum (Vanessa) got hooked on alcohol and drugs she was caring, kind, nice and a warm hearted mother now she just beats me till I'm the size of a pulp. "what are you doing here shouldn't you have left by now?" my so called 'mother' said to me as she kicked me in my rib on her way down the stairs...
I had no friends at school none whatsoever, the only friends I have are a knife, veins, blood, and DEATH.
I reached the school gates, and as per usual loads of snotty horrible looking girls came over to me telling me to die and go cut myself till there is nothing left, I hold back my tears and just ignore them and walk away as my sister Kelly told me to do before she died.....
"hey Anna say nothing if your a slut!" christian said to me as I walked along the school corridor "what's that no reply ewww gross, HEY EVERYONE ANNA JUST ADMMITED SHES A SLUT BY NOT SAYING ANYTHIG!" everyone laughed at me, taunted me and killed me in my mind, by the end of the day after a few more beatings off, of my parents, I was nothing but a pile of crap waiting to be picked up and thrown in the trash.
