When I got to the coffee-shop, I was five minutes late. Crap. Michael was standing outside in the rain, probably freezing to death. When he saw me, he started jogging in my direction.
"Lilith, hey! I almost started thinking you stood me up." he almost shouted, because of the rain drumming down on our hoods. "No, oh my god, I would never do that!" I chuckled and he put his arm around my waist. "I know you wouldn't. C'mon, the movie-shop is this was." he said and lead me the opposite way of where I came from.

By the time we entered the movie-shop, we were soaking wet. When the door opened and we went inside, it was like a warm paradise. Only six people were in the shop, including us. A middle aged couple was looking in the... erm.."adult" section. A young boy was looking in the "action" section, holding a few Marvel movies. And by the desk was a boy about our age, flipping through some comic-book.
"Hey Ash!" Michael approached the boy by the desk, who looked up at him and smiled widely. "Hey Mikey! Watcha doing here?" he asked, closing the comic and putting it in a bunch of others."Me and my new friend over here, are looking for a movie based on a mildly depressing book." he replied and winked at me.
"How many times do I have to-" "shush, were setting this when we've watched the movie." he waved me off, making me smack him at the back of his head. "OW! what the hell?!" he exclaimed, rubbing the now sore spot on his head.
"I'm sensing some serious sexual tension here my "friends"." 'Ash' wiggled his eyebrows at me and Michael, making both of us blush and scoot away from eachother. "Shut up" Michael mumbled, and 'Ash' giggled. He reached his hand out for me to shake and said; "Hi, I'm Ashton, but you can call me Ash if you want." He smiled at me, and I took a good look at him. He had tan skin and messy dirty blonde hair which was slightly curly. He had green eyes, but not as green as Michael's, and he was pretty well built. I gladly shook it, but as soon as our skin touched, I go this cold feeling, and shivered. "I'm Lilith..." I stuttered, and Ashton frowned.
"Hey, are you cold?" Michael looked at me concerned. "Yeah, a bit, but I'll live," I smiled weakly at him. "I think we have some blankets in the back, I can go get some." Ashton suggested, sending Michael a weird look. Michael looked back at him somewhat confused, before replying; "Yeah, I'll go with you. Why don't you try finding the movie in the meantime?" Michael patted my back before heading to the back-room with Ashton. "OK...?" I quietly replied and walked towards the "drama" section.

Michael's P.O.V

As we walked into the back.room, Ashton looked around like we were being watched. "Dude, what's wrong with you?" I demanded as he closed the door behind us. "What's wrong with ME? WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?! What the hell are you thinking?!" He shouted, before realizing it, and lowering his voice. "What the fuck are you talking about?" I groaned. Ashton widened his eyes at me, his mouth falling open. "Have you fucking lost your mojo or something?! There is obviously something really, and I mean really bad about her. She's got a greater demons name for screaming it out loud!"
I frowned, not really sure what to say. "Ash..." I begun, but he quickly cut me off. "NO! Michael, we came to America for a reason, and now you're fooling around with someone who maybe is it?" he raged, and I grabbed his shoulders. "MAYBE! Come on dude, you have to trust me, I haven't felt anything!" I pleaded, she was NOT one of them.
Ash put his hands in his face, breathing in and out slowly. He closed his eyes and said; "We'll find out soon enough. I'll join your little "movie-night", to see if there's anything suspicious about her." I was about to argue, but sighed and nodded. After he regained his calm, cheerful self, we grabbed a blanket and went back into the shop.
