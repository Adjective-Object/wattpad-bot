As I went down the creaky steps, something caught my eye. Well it was more of a someone to be precise. It's silhouette suggested that it was a female but something told me otherwise. I looked down at my hands so I could come up with an elaborate scheme so I could get out of here. Wherever I was anyway. The next thing I knew, I was looking into the eyes of my nightmare and its irises were burning into mine. CRASH!
All of a sudden, I was splayed all over the wooden panels that lay beneath steps. A searing pain rushed up my leg and I felt as if I was dying. But it wasn't over yet. I looked up to see its eyes carefully assessing my situation before pouncing on me like some kind of animal.
Moments later, scratches were situated all over my skin with blood seeping out of them. Whatever that thing was it was gone now. As I attempted to stand up, my head started pounding. I managed to take one tiny step before I collapsed onto the floor. Defeated, I curled up in pain and began to cry. Millions of tears began cascading down my face.Then, the front door swung open and an intruder  walked in. 'Sam, are you okay? Stammered the stranger, who was now looking over me with worry plastered all over her face.
