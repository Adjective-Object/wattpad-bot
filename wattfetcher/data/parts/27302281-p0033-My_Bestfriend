"Selena's" he answered
By now I had tears running down my face
" why were you at Selena's"  I asked
" to talk to her " he said
" about " I said annoyed  and hurt by the time he would answer my lip quivered  and my heart was broken in two everything was hurting I  felt like couldn't breathe this must be what heartbreak feels like
"   I was trying to convince her not to text you then I decided I wanted to tell you before but it didn't work that way" he said
I just wanted him to hold me and say it won't happen again but I knew he would be lying he lost all my trust
" I love you" he said
" I love you too but  you broke my trust  so I can't trust you not to hurt me " I said crying into his  chest
We laid there and fell asleep
