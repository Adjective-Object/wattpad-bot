"Again, I can take a cab" Kylie said grabbing her guitar case and two tribal designed suitcases.
"No, and that's final" Steve said sternly.
"Okay, I'll see you later then?" Kylie said.
"Yep, love you" Steve said.
"Love you too" Kylie said and hung up. She grabbed her suitcases and wheeled them out to where taxis would be. Kylie knew her uncle said that she couldn't take a cab but how else was she going to get to his house. She stuck her arm out to hail one when she heard a voice calling her name.
"Kylie!" the voice said. Kylie turned around and saw her uncle's coworker Chin Ho Kelly.
"Chin!" Kylie said excitedly.
"Aloha, kiddo" he said laughing when Kylie hugged him.
"Aloha" she said back.
"Steve said you would need a ride" he said and they both got into his car.
