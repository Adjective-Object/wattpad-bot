***Spotted Amelia making a heroic exit from B's party. Too bad for her there's school on Monday. So until next time you know you love me..X.O.X.O. Gossip Girl
***So that was chapter one. In case you didn't realize when I put the writing in bold and italics that's Gossip Girls blog. No that does not mean Madilynn and Amelia are Gossip Girl. Anyway please remember to vote and comment. Stay strong my loves. -lilycupid
