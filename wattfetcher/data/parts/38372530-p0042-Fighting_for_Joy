"Thank you daddy." I said as I stood up and hugged him.
"Oh you're welcome sweetheart. Go home and fix this stuff baby girl." He told me and I nodded.
"Okay daddy. Take  care of my girls and my son." I said kissing his cheeks up.
I miss my chunky little baby boy and my two girls! This rest of the week will be so hard without them.
After spending a little bit more time with my father and son and running a few errands I decided to go home only for Devin not to be here.
I sighed and decided to shower and then take a nap. Tonight will be the night that we figure all of this craziness out. This is not the way our kids need to live and it won't be this way.
