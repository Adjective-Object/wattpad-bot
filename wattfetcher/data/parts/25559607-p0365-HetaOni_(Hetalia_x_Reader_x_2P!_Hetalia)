Laughing before helping her up (of course), I spoke, "Ha! Who's the klutz now, eh?"


Dusting off her dress, the little girl puffed her cheeks. "Fine, fine. Let's just forget I ever said that." she said, feeling embarassed.


"How did you trip, anyway?" I asked, inspecting the floor.


(Name) suddenly jumped. "Oh! Right, I completely forgot!" she suddenly knelt down, her hands searching for the bump on the floor that made her trip.


I saw what it was. It was some sort of metal handle...? The wooden flooring on that part seemed to be a little elevated unlike the rest of the hall.


"Is that......a door?" I asked curiously.


Smiling, she tried to pull the handle with all her might. "...Yep!~"


Helping the girl, I managed to open the strange passage enough for us to take a look at what's beyond.



I don't see much, just a red carpeted hall. It's a bit too high to jump down, how will we be able to get there?


Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my left palm. "Argh...What the..." I quickly turned my hand over. Out of nowhere, I had a small scar appear on my palm. It seemed like it was already an old one. Did...did I have this before..?


Snapping me from my thoughts, (Name) tapped my shoulder and handed me a long rope. "Where did you get this?" I asked.


"I found it over there on one of the tables." she told me, pointing at a table a few feet ahead of us. There were even shards of...what was it? It looks like broken vases. Lots of them. "Thanks, but, you should've told me. I could have gotten them for us instead. What if you get a cut from those broken vase pieces?" I said.


She took a step back and laughed nervously. "Ahaha. Err, funny you mentioned that..." she trailed off, hiding her hands behind her back.


"You're kidding me." I squinted my eyes at her.


Pouting, she spoke, "I-I'm okay, really!"
