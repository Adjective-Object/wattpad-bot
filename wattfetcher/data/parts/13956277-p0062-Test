"A bet is a bet, give me your 50"
"Leeena Leeeenaaaaa" I turned around and saw the red-headed Robin running to my direction.
"Hey Robin, slow down" I smiled.
"I-I" He breathed heavily.
"I just came to thank you for what you did, I was about to go home with a black eye" He chuckled.
"You're welcome. Do they do this to you much ?" I asked worriedly.
"Not much much, but today I did a prank" He laughed.
"Hmmmm, You little leprechaun, what did you do to make the Boogeyman mad ?" I raised an eyebrow.
"You can say ... revenge. I put some chewed gum in his bag" He said.
"Eww" I wrinkled my nose.
"Yeah babe, it wasn't pretty at all" We exploaded in laughter.
"What about Miley ?" I raised an eyebrow.
"Only replaced her lip-gloss with some glue" He said innocently.
"Only ?" We laughed.
"I see you're not as innocent as you look" I giggled.
"I should go to my class, maybe later we'll arrange a prank for Miley" I winked.
"I'm under your commands" He ran to his class while I ran to mine.

The last classes went smoothly.
I went to pray Duhr prayer, I opened the art room door and got shocked.
"Wh-what are you too doing here ?" My eyes widened at Tom and Molly who were there alone with the lights off and the curtains down.
"Oh we- Nothing" He answered.
"Shame on you two, SHE'S YOUR BESTFTIEND'S SISTER"
"No you got it wrong don-" I shut the door and searched for another place to pray in.
Tom and Molly !!! I didnt expect this.

Me and Elina walked out of school.
"You expelled Conor, what's next ? Mrs.Peterson maybe ?" Elina laughed.
"You better not upset Leena Ahmed, babe" We exploaded in laugher but I lowered my voice and face when I noticed some boys in front of us.
"Hey sturdy gurl" Ya Allah ! I'm in trouble now.
"I couldn't give you the punch I wanted. You got some great fast reactions, let's add this to the 'hot things Leena has' list" Conor smirked, two other boys walked behind him.
"Can you imagine the things we can do to you ?" One of the two boys spoke.
I-freaked-out.
"Go away before I call my brother" Elina threatened.
"Back off Ms.Catrer" The other boy pushed her away.
I pulled my phone to call the police.
"No" Conor snapped it from me and threw me over his shoulder.
Either I'm too thin -and I'm not- or the boys here are stronger than they look.
"Let her go" Someone I couldn't see -because I was over Con=nor's shoulder- came and pushed Conor, so he fell and I flew in the air. Ya subhanallah, I'm flying ! NO I'M FALLING
