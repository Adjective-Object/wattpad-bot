"May I bring you in?" Ace asked politely.
"No way, Hose." Sakura answered harshly.
"Would you like me to kick your ass inside?" Haruka asked gently.
"What kind of a proposal is that?" Aya asked sweatdropping.
They eventually entered the hall which was decorated to theme Fishman Island. To the untrained eye, it seemed perfect except to Sakura who was able to see the minor mistakes though they were not big enough to point out.
Wolf whistles could've been heard all over as Robin and the others walked in. Aya went in search of somebody and Nami and Robin got occupied by Luffy. Sakura went off to a dimly lit corner, where she sat behind a pole and read.
The night was ging along well. al least for Sakura as she finished the bok she was reading. Hearing footsteps, she quickly got only to be greeted by Haruka.
"What the hell do you want?" Sakura asked heartlessly. Haruka just looked at the ground with a sad expression.
"Sorry."
"Huh?"
"I'm sorry for earlier. I didn't mean to put you in a bad mood." Haruka apologized.
Sakura was dumbfounded. She thought that Haruka was physically incapable of apologizing, "Um...What should I do? He's apologizing and usually....I don't care what he does but...why is my heart beating s fast?"
"It's okay, Haruka. I forgive now go out there and have some fun!" Sakura answered, pushing onto the dancefloor where he got stuck with some random girl. Sakura just watched the thers dance with their patners.
There was Aya and Law, Luffy and Hancock, Zoro and Robin, Sanji and Nami, Ace and some random girl. Usopp came over to her and asked for a dance which she gladly accepted.
~Le time-skippy because I feel tired. Brought to you by Soul King.
Shanks got up on the stage and announced, "Tomorrow, we'll be going back to the school however, you'll be having a day off s enjoy your night in the villa! But be sure to ready for the train at 10 in the morning."
Everybody that there cheered and got back to their villas. During that time, the students wore a simple blue  kimono with varying patterns depending on the likes of the student. The boys of Villa 4 including Law and Ace were heading t the girl's room where there was food and sake for all.
That was until they face faulted at the sight they saw.
"W-Who  did it?" Law asked.
"Who let the women drink all the sake!" Zoro complained.
"Not enough! Not enough sake!" Robin angrily yelled.
"My eyes are spinning." Aya said on the floor.
"Aya, hang on!" Hancock cried.
"Ne Ne Hancock, let's play." Sakura said, twirling a cup of sake.
Nami was just there laughing like a maniac, "This is fun!"
"The food.." Ace started, looking at the overturned table.
"They ate all of it?" Zoro asked.
"Why are you all drinking?" Haruka asked.
"Oi Sensei! Why is there sak-" Law shouted before getting hit with a sake cup.
"Shut up Law. Come drink with us. Get a refill on the booze while yOu at it. GET A REFILL ON THE BOOZE!" Robin said angrily.
