Open your eyes, and realize all their lies.Will it be worth the pain, all their fun little games.Lying awake every night, watching the dying candle light.Letting yourself drown in thought, almost like you've been taught.You've perfected this process, just another thing to obsess.Quietly yelling, silent speaking.You blame yourself, Listening to the ticking from the clock on the shelf.
Open your eyes, insides filled with despise.What have you had to gain, it was them to blame.Battling every fight, knowing that you're right.Feeling the pain they've brought, knowing they've got you caught.Dying of stress, just saying less and less.You continue dwelling , its got you stuck, this feeling.hearing the ringing in your head, you sit and cry in bed.
Open your eyes, they cant hear your cries.Full of shame, crazed with their claim.Abused and you aren't free, your used can't you see?You've realized the truth, it's taken your youth.You're now just a mess, it's amazing how you lasted i must confess.I've noticed it now, it's something you've not allowed.you've been crying, it's quite alarming.
You're eyes are open, i see that.Don't force them shut, its something you're good at.They're beautiful, you know.You're eyes, grey with the sorrow.I don't want you to hurt.Although you're full of alert.I'll still love you, and your fully open eyes.
