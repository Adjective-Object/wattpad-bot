I turned to my strawberry blond haired friend and creased my forehead, "What? ...Ollie...are you....sure...?"

"...Ja. They were the ones who attacked first. We were just going to get you."


"...Is...is that true?"



"They...They can't be trusted. They were probably going to kill you..."

Italy stepped forward and spoke with trembling lips, "I-I'm sorry...I never would have wanted to speak bad of my friends...but...they really did. They didn't tell me, but it happened. They really did start the fight. They really did try to...kill them."
