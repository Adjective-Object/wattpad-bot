Hi/Hey

As Lucy stated in her about me, I am not the greatest at describing myself. I'm pretty boring, in fact.

My name is Katlynn. I'm not going to give my full name because I'd rather that stay locked up, so no one can stalk me on Facebook or anything. I'm 15, turning 16 in October.

I have 3 siblings, an older brother, younger brother, and younger sister. My parents are divorced, and my mom is remarried. I live with my mother, but go to see my dad every other weekend.

Chris Evans is the love of my life. I don't even know how I lived before I watched Captain America/Avengers. I plan on marrying him in the future, although that is just a silly little dream of mine.

I love love love The Walking Dead, Supernatural, Teen Wolf, American Horror Story, Doctor Who, Parks and Recreation, and a lot of other shows.

I cannot go a day without listening to music. Imagine Dragons, Against the Current, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Maroon 5, and Starset are amongst the thousands of bands that I love.

Like Lucy said, her and I met about 4 months ago. I remember the day she followed me. I was at my dads and I had just woken up and saw she followed me. At first, I thought she accidentally clicked the follow button, because seriously, why would someone as perfect as her follow me? We became friends ever since, and talk almost every night. I love her to death.

Her, Lindsey, and Jade are my best friends on this website. I couldn't imagine my life without them.
