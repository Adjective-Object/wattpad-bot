"Bepo!"
"I'm sorry."
"Don't apologize." Aya said calmly looking at him.
"aren't you forgetting someone, Nurse?''
"Law-sama, how could I ever forget you?" Aya answered smiling at him , still completely oblivious to the position she found herself in.
"Woah, we better give them some space. We don't wanna interupt." Nami joked elbowing Sakura.
"I agree." Sakura answered.
"Shut up! I don't think about Law-sama that way." Aya answered softly.
"Or do you? "Law whispered into her ear deliberatly with the intention of making her blush.
"Stop it! " Aya shouted. Chopper,  who was still in Sakura's arms realized,  "Aya,  your ears."
Aya touched her head and felt the two pink horse ears and felt her tail.
"You guys are being mean especially Kid." Aya cried with the cutest pout face in the world.
"I haven't even spoken to you yet. ".Kid growled.
"You're being mean by your presence, asshole. " Sakura answered back thus earning another slap.
"I'm gonna kill you all." Kid stated already getting up to attack.
"Now Now," Ace started holding Kid's arm, "Just who are you going to kill? "
"Tch. "
"Ah, Ace-kun, is dreamy when at work." Haruka stated somehow reviving.
"You're alive?! " Sakura asked in pure surprise.
"What's that supposed to mean, bitch? " Haruka asked earning himself another slap.
"When the hell are we going to leave?" Kid asked.
"Oh yeah,"  Sakura stated being the only one who heard him, "Nami-san, when are we leaving?"
"Oh,  we're waiting for Franky, Usopp and Brook to come back with emergency supplies. " Nami answered calmly.
"Um, Nami . Brook is right here. " Aya answered nervously everyone then looked at Brook who started laughing.
"Wait, where's Zoro? " Chopper asked.
After a moment of silence and realization,  everyone started to lose colour.
"We're screwed. "---------
Sakura:  We're So evil.Nami:  But it's fun.
Zoro: Y'all should go to hell .Nami:  Thank you.
