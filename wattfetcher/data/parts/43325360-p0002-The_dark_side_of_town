Melissa's p.o.v
''Hey dad ,mom said if we can go out tonight for pizza",I said and I didn't hear an answer I repeated it again then I heard footsteps coming up to my room and the door opened I knew it was dad because mom wasn't home so when I turned around dad was so close to me that I couldn't breathe properly then I asked him ''dad what are you doing", then he raised his hand and he slapped me I could've felt the sting go through my face then hot teats came streaming down my face then he said you little rascal don't you ever yell at me again understood I nodded and then I was about to speak when he said don't you dare talk to my while I am talking to you then he slapped me again when I tried to fight back he would give me a kick in my jaw that let out to a scream everytime he kicked me I let out a scream when finally we heard a car pull up and it was my mom then I let out a sigh of relief then he whispered this is not over yet then I jumped in fright then he left my room a lot of questions came to my mind then it finally hit me should I tell mom or not then I heard a knocking on my door then I jumped out of my fantasy and ran to my toilet to wash off my face as soon as I was done I ran to my bedroom door to see a worried mother and a horrid father then my mom ran up to me and hugged me then she whispered into my ear saying that she was worried a lot about me then let go of me and said dinner is almost ready while walking downstairs then my father turned around and gave me a look that said if you tell your mom you wouldn't like what is in store for you before turning around and walking away I just went to my bedroom to freshen up for dinner since tomorrow is my first day of school.
