❝You can love someone so much... but you can never love someone as much as you can miss them❞
- J.G
Dearest Noel,
Today my bullies mentioned your name... My head began spinning, my heart began beating fast, my fingers became numb, my lips began trembling and tears began spilling out my eyes. They said it was all my fault Noel, they said I was the reason you're gone.
I believed them...
I knew it was the truth...
I picked up my bag and ran away, Noel. I ran as fast as I could. I didn't know where I was going or what I was doing. All I knew was that I wanted you Noel, right then and there. I wanted you in my arms. I wanted to feel your warm embrace, your whispering in my ears; that everything would be okay.
I wanted you back so much.
I want you back Noel.
I had been running and I stopped...It was only then I realized, it was our place Noel...
I ran to our place without realizing.
Nothing seemed the same anymore. The skies looked gloomy and dark, the wind sang with a soft gentle sadness, the leaves were still and brown, the birds no longer chirped our favourite song.
Evrything had changed.
I sat for hours, Noel, under our tree.
I waited for you.
I waited to hear your voice, I waited to see your beautiful baby-blue eyes and bright smile. I waited hours upon hours for you, Noel.
...but you never came...
