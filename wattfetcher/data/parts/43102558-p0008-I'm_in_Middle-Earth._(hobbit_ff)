Haley's POV....
Blake and I were waiting for the dwarves Gandalf had coming to come. We were warned about us slowly becoming our true form. I'm basically going to be a human who grows slowly. Blake isn't going to be a full elf. He will be half elf have human. There was a knock on the door. Bilbo answered it.
"Dwalin at your service." A male voice said.
A dwarf walked through here and sat down. Bilbo made a plate of food for Dwalin. "Hi, I'm Blake. This is my sister Haley." Blake introduced us. Dwalin looked at us then continued eating. There was a separate knock on the door. Bilbo got it. Dwalin finished eating.
"Balin at your service." An elderly voice announced.
An elderly dwarf walked in. Dwalin went up to him and hugged. "Hello brother." Balin smiled. Where is Michelle? I sighed.
"You've gotten shorter and wider since the last time I saw ya." Dwalin replied.
"Wider not shorter."
There was yet another knock. I got up to get it instead. I opened the door. There stood two dwarves. The younger one was cuter. "Fili-" The blonde dwarf started.
"And Kili-" The younger one continued.
"At your service." They finished together.
"Haley at your service." I smirked at Kili.
"Fili, Kili, come help us!" Dwalin called.
Fili's eyes were filled with sadness when he looked around for someone but didn't see the person. I became curious about who he was searching for. Another knock appeared on the door. I opened it to see a lot of dwarves piled on top of each other. The fell over. I chuckled. Gandalf was on the other side. I joined Blake at the table. Kili brought us a plate to eat. Fili saved a plate and a mug of ale.
"We are missing two." Gandalf noted.
"They went to the Blue Mountains to meet with our cousins. They will come." Dwalin said.
"Good." Gandalf smiled.
Who are we missing? I thought.
Michelle's POV....
"I told you that we are lost!" I yelled.
"We are not lost!" Thorin argued.
"Why don't we ask for help?!"
"We don't need help!"
"Yes we do! We need to find a green door in the shire! Let me get a look around. I'll be back soon."
I climbed a tree and saw the shire. I climbed back down. "I know where to go. I will take the lead since you got us lost twice." I said. Thorin didn't argue. I led the way to the shire. I knew where to go now. I walked down a path with Thorin trailing after me. I noticed a green door with a light blue, glowing mark on it. We went up to the door. There was singing going on inside. I went to knock on the door, but Thorin pulled my hand away then knocked.
"Why did you do that?! I am allowed to knock!" I shouted.
"You can't knock right. You have to knock a firm, humble knock." Thorin said.
"It doesn't matter how you knock! It's just a door! You don't have to always get your way!"
"I am a king! You will not speak to me like that!" Thorin yelled.
"No, you're a stuck up, damn witted, prideful, sexist, egotistical, self-centered bastard!" I countered.
Thorin raised his hand and slapped me as the door opened. Everyone saw him slap me. Tears swelled up in my eyes. "I hate you!" I screamed. I ran off to the river to let the fall. I can't believe he slapped me. I cried.
