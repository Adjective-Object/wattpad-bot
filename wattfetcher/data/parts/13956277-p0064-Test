"You two go home, me and Elina will walk with her" Damon understood my glare.
"I already want to go with you to do that project" Damon's eyes widened.
"I'll go with you to do it" Damon said.
"No, my house is too noisy, some builders came to re-decorate it"
"I tried my best" Damon whispered to me, I sighed.
"I need to go now, bye Elina" Lewis left.
"We should do something" I whispered to Elina.
"What ? he insists to come" She whispered back.
"I really hate Conor" I whispered.
"Me either" Simon said, me and Elina jumped.
"Heyy !!! it's a sisters talk" Elina slapped him playfully.
"Ouch" He rubbed his cheek.
"Where's your house, Leena ?" Simon smiled.
mind: Don't lie don't lie don't lie Leena.
"It's near".
We reached the Carters' crib.
"Aren't we gonna go to Leena's first ?" Simon looked confused.
"We already did" I said.
"What ?" Confusion became more visible on his face.
"I live here"
"You're Damon's secret girlfriend !" Simon gasped and I laughed.
"What !  no-freaking-way" I chuckled.
"Well, what is it ?" We walked inside th house.
"Hey Mom" I hugged Mrs.Carter.
"YOU'RE THEIR SECRET DAUGHTER" Simon freaked out, we teared a bit because of laughter.
"SOMEBODY PLEASE GIVE ME AN ANSWER" He shouted.
"Calm down" I said between my giggles and then told him the whole story from when I got into the plane until Damon called my father.
"Woah" Simon got surprised.
"That's why I don't want anybody to know, they'll get it wrong just like you did, and I don't have enough time to tell the whole story to everyone I meet" I explained.
"You're lucky" Simon whispered to Damon.
"I'm not, she doesn't speak to me, she almost broke my ribs once" Damon whispered back.
"By the way, I'm still standing here" I snapped my fingers and they both cleared their throats.
"Don't worry, I won't tell anybody as long as you don't want to" He smiled.
I climbed to my room to change my clothes, but felt something strange ...
Something is different.
The window ....
I figured out that you hate yellow and love white so I replaced your yellow windows with new white and brown ones that match your room.
I also figured out that you hate perfumes, so I got you something else, Please don't throw it out the new window .
Hint : Open your closet.
PS : Nice job with Conor and stinky Miley
