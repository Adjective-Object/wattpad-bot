Lauren's POV
I yawned waking up feeling slightly in pain I groaned.
I looked to my left to see my mother holding my hand while she slept and to see my husband on my right siting up straight face timing someone.
"Cara I promise you when mommy wakes up I'll come and get you but right now, this hospital isn't a place for you to be." He said assertively.
"But daddy! I want to play with the baby and I need to see mommy. I can't sleep without her." She whined causing him to sigh.
"Alright. I'll send uncle Christian to come get you." He informed.
"Yay!" She yelled and thanked him.
I moved my arm because my eyes feel heavy and my mouth is as dry as cotton. Luckily, it caught his attention and he came to me.
"Oh baby." He said and kissed my forehead. "You're awake." He sniffed causing me to smile. I motioned for him to get the bottle of water and he did, putting the water to my lips.
"Thank you." I said sounding horse.
He smiled and wiped the tears from his eyes as they fell
"Why are you crying?" I asked him and then thought. "Is it something wrong with the baby!" I asked.
He shook his head. "No. The baby is fine." He assured.
I thought about the past events. Having the baby way before my due date thinking of all the strain I probably put on our baby, I began to cry.
"The baby. I put too much stress on the baby." I said shaking my head.
"Hush love hush. It's fine." He cooed to me. "The baby is in NICU."
"Oh god that means they're giving my baby Similac." I said worried.
"No, Kelsey wouldn't let them." He chuckled. "She had pumped some milk right in the waiting room. She said you'd appreciate the baby having her milk as opposed to Similac."
I smiled. "She's so right. Is Everybody here?" I asked.
"Yeah. Everybody's outside ." He said and kissed my lips. "I love you Joy."
"I love you too." I said and kissed him again.
"I'm gonna go get everybody. You wake up mama." He said and I nodded.
"Mama." I said and shook my hand causing her to move her head.
"Lauren." She said and hugged me.
I hugged her back and she kissed my head and then popped me.
"I should whoop you chile. Had me all types of worried." she sniffed.
"I'm sorry mama." I laughed and she kissed my head again.
"How you feeling?" She asked.
I shrugged. "A little bit of pain. I'm all good for the most part." I said.
"That's good. We gonna get a nurse to see you okay?" She asked me and I nodded.
Everyone began to flood my room. I had balloons and flowers, cards and teddy bears galore.
"Aww Yall!" I laughed seeing Erin and Kelsey come in with stuff flooding their hands.
"You scared us all Lauren. Had me forgetting I was about that thug life." Erin said causing me to laugh.
"I appreciate you all for coming. I'm so sleepy y'all. All I want to do is see my baby and get so rest." I said
