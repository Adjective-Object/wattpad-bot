"Probably.It makes no sound when we shake it..." Japan said, nodding.

England stepped a little closer to inspect the wooden box and noticed something. "Hm? Wait, wait a minute. This is a little odd."

"Odd? How so?" Japan asked.

England shook his head. "Oh, sorry.You probably won't get it, but this...has some of my magic, too. What the hell?"

"Your magic? You mean this belongs to you?" Canada concluded.

I edged closer to them and spoke, "Well, it's not quite like that..." I turned to England

and continued, "...England, you can lift the spell on this thing, right?"

"W-Well, yes. Give me a minute." he replied, raising his hands over the box.

Suddenly, a flash of light emanated from his hands and got directed over the object. An audible click was heard afterwards.

"Hm. It made a sound. Let's try opening it?" Russia suggested.

America started to look giddy and jumped. "Oh! What is it? I hope it's ice cream!"

I raised an eyebrow at him. "Ice cream? Like won't it be all melted if it was?"

"Yeah. But even if it was, we could at least get a little happiness out of it, right?" he

grinned.
Seeing his smile made me look away for some reason. "Sorry, but it's far from ice cream. Far from happiness." I whispered quietly.

As soon as we opened the box, a voice was suddenly heard coming out of it.
"......the......y..."

A burst of light emanated from the box, and at that, some sort of hologram began to materialise in front of us.

"Hm?" Canada tried to adjust his eyes to recognise the figure.

Russia took a step back upon identifying the holographic figure. "What?!"

"E-England?!" America exclaimed in bewilderment.
"......and
......it!"

England's eyes grew wide as he exclaimed from confusion, "W-what is this?! Why am I there?!"

"Shush!! He's saying something!" Japan told him. He heard the muffled voices of the England hologram, who was seemingly panting heavily and looked quite bruised here and there.
