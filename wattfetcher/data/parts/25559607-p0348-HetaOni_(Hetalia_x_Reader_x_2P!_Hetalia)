...then that could mean...



All of us had the same thing in mind after finding out about it.




We all ran up the hall.



=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



When we arrived at the upper corridor, our fears were confirmed.




We witnessed a large grey creature push the (h/c) haired ragazza towards the wall. Her back collided with it with such impact, she winced from the pain. Still conscious, she noticed our presence and looked at us. "Guys, run." she warned.



The scene just made my insides feel that hollow feeling of long ago.



No. Not again.




"(Second Name)!!" I shouted as I charged after the monster, making it turn its attention to me.




With a quick motion, I expertly attacked the creature with my switchblades, but it wasn't doing that much damage. It just slowed it down.



At that, the others also lunged after the monster before us and attacked. All of us, both First Players and Second Players engaged in a battle against the creature. We lured it over to the other side of the upper corridor.



Swords, guns, knives, and power of all sorts. We weren't doing a good job working together, probably because we loathed each other to death, since the monster wasn't looking like it will be disappearing anytime soon. Just as we managed to get the monster away from the ragazza, who was at the other end of the hall, the Thing turned away from us and began heading towards the girl at a quick speed. Attacking it with weapons wouldn't help us stop it in time. Ordinary weapons, that is...so...
