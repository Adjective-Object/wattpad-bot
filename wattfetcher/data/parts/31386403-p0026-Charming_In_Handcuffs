And hearing Jack speak French was definitely something. I watched his lips as he spoke, almost zoning out completely. "Was that it?" He asked, breaking me out of my trance.
I nodded quickly. "Yeah, just keep practicing."
I wrote a list of words for him to practice and pushed it towards him.  "Just practice these until Thursday and start reading my notes."
He scanned over the page and nodded. "Thanks."
"Don't thank me yet." I teased, almost regretting it.
I stood up and started walking out of his room.
I felt Jack on my heels as I made my way down the stairs and out the front door. "You didn't have to walk me outside." I mumbled, turning around to face him."
"I may be an ass, but I'm also a gentleman."
The jury was out on that. "Whatever you say, McKinnon. I'll be back Thursday."
Just as I turned around and started walking, he said, "And the answer to your question is that I don't know."
How could you not know if you murdered someone?
