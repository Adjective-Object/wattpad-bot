It begins to sprinkle, and Cas steps out in it, singing, "FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN! NO ONE ELSE CAN FEEL IT FOR YA! ONLY YOU CAN LET IT IN. NO ONE ELSE, NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEAK THE WORDS ON YOUR LIPS," and so on.
Dean walked into the light rainfall and kissed Castiel.
Then, he got on one knee, and pulled out a bear and a bunny, setting them down. Castiel gasped. From his pocket, Dean pulled out a mood ring.
"Castiel Bu- every time. Castiel Novak, I love you. And we're grownups now. Will you marry me?"
Castiel pulled Dean to his feet and kissed him before yelling, "OF COURSE, OF COURSE." He slipped the mood ring on his finger before picking up the bear and bunny. "Where the hell did you find these?!"
"I, uhm... it's a long story."
"I don't care. I don't care. I love you, Dean!"
"I love you, too, Cas."
