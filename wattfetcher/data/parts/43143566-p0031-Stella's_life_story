as i got done with my homework and silently screaming the music songs i were listining to.
going upstairs i got and idea.plugging in my earphones to my laptop i hit record on my phone.
once the song was done i listen to the recording...it was...terrable..i sounded terrable...my voice sounded terrable...im glad ill be quiting chorus becuse i sound like a dying dokey..
great the one thing i thought i was good on..it made me feel a little better knowing a had something good but of course the world doesnt like me and decided to make me find out i sound terrable...
but its not the worlds fault im a fat ugly loner with a discusting hideous voice..its mine..but what can i do about it..
deciding to try and ignore it-having no luck at all but decided i could pretend that everything was fine-and watched some more music videos and gamming videos here and there from 'game theory'
i LOVE game theory,they are the best!i sighed as i leaned back on my back on my bed putting on another song to listen to..trying to avoid singing..
