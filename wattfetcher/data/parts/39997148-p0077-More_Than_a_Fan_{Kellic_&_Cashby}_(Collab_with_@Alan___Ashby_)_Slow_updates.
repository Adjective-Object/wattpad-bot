"I'll try my best."
"We are not insane Vic!" Jess said.
"Yes you are," I said rolling my eyes, "I mean you're dating Jaime."
"That's true."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Jaime demanded, "I am a fucking catch thank you."
"Yes you are baby." She said and kissed him.
"Vic you're just jealous because you don't have anyone special in your life." Erin told me.
"Yet." I told her.
"Yet?" They all asked.
"What do you mean yet?" Alysha asked.
"I have my eyes on someone but I'm not ready yet and said person completely understands."
"Why aren't you ready?" Jess demanded, "Whoever it is, is probably ten times better than that last bitch."
"I'd like to think I am." Kellin said smiling a little.
I smiled, "You are."
"That's adorable- Vic he's adorable you need to stop messing around and date him." Erin said, "I'm Erin by the way."
"I'm not messing around, he completely understands."
"Nice to meet you, I'm Kellin." He told her, "And I get it, he's a weenie who's not ready for a relationship."
I rolled my eyes, "Yes, I'm a weenie then."
"You are a weenie. Seriously get it together man." Jess told me, "Like he's perfect for you and I don't even know him."
"That's what we've been telling him." Mike informed her.
"Mike shut up."
"No, I don't have to listen to you."
"Just shush for once."
"Don't tell me what to do! My body guard's here now and she'll beat you up for being mean to me." He said glaring at me.
"Alysha kick Mikes ass."
"Eh, I'll do it later. I want to know more about your little boyfriend over here." She said smiling at Kellin.
I sighed, "He's not my boyfriend."
"Not yet." She pointed out, "You said so yourself, now Kellin- tell us about yourself. Who are you? What are you doing on the tour? How old are you?"
"Where are you from? What's your favorite color?" Jess added.
"Oh and what's your favorite dessert!" Erin asked smiling.
"I'm the merch manager, uh, I'm twenty-one. I'm from Oregon." He said, "I guess purple and pizza."
"Kells, pizza isn't a dessert." I told him.
"Well it should be."
"But its not."
"It is to me."
"It's still not a dessert no matter what you say." I said rolling my eyes.
"Its a dessert whether you like it or not."
"No it's not, you're in denial." I argued.
"My god Vic! If Kellin wants pizza as his dessert let him have it as his dessert!" Jaime exclaimed.
"Fine." I grumbled, "He's still wrong though."
"I'm never wrong."
