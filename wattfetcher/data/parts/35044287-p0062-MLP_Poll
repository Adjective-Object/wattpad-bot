Out of the three finalist, I'm not that surprise to see that she was out. I'm actually excited to see who wins. I can't wait. Most of guys have the same opinion on who should be out, so yeah. Anyway if you voted out Coco then you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!

And the finalist are:
CHEESE SANDWICH
DISCORD
Good luck to the two finalist!
