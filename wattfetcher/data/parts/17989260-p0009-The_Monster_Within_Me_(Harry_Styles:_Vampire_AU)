Trisha's POV
I slowly walked in the living room, careful with every step that I took because Niall's a new born which means that he's a lot more powerful than anyone else, including me.
"Niall?" I said my voice echoed through out my house.
I didn't get any response so I decided to yell his name a lot more louder this time.
"Niall?" I yelled. This time I felt movement from the kitchen. I slowly and quietly walked towards the kitchen and saw my mum's plates and glasses scattered everywhere. In the corner of the kitchen near the fridge sat Niall, pale and covered in sweat.
I was about to walk towards him quietly without making any sound when I accidentally hit my mum's vase which caused it to fall on the floor creating a very loud and annoying noise.
His opened immediately and looked at me. Hunger evident in his eyes. His eyes were tinted red, just like the human BLOOD.
"Ni-" I was about to speak but got interrupted when a sudden force pushed me towards the wall.
It was Niall.
He pushed me very hard against the wall which created cracks on the wall but not hard enough for it to collapse.
He stared at me hungrily and he even tried to bite me but I kept on slapping him.
"Ni-all do not make me do something terrible to you.'' I coughed as he started choking me. Of course being the newborn he was, he ignored what I said and continued choking me.
I felt my eyes turn red but it's still not enough strength for me to out power a newborn like him so he continued to choke me to death.
"Niall do not make me hurt you" I growled as I felt my fangs came out as I struggled under his grip around my neck. He then began banging my head against the wall making me feel a bit dizzy but not enough to make me unconscious.
"Niall I'm sorry." I whispered as I finally let the inner monster of mine take over my body.
In one swift motion I got him pinned under me as he struggled to get out of my strong grip around his neck. He tried scratching my face but it didn't stop the monster from pinning him down. He kept on fighting back not giving me any signs that he's calming down so I decided to compel him because us vampires can do that to help us lure our preys.
"Calm the fuck down!" I spoke as I compelled him.
He suddenly stopped fighting back and stared at nothing. I noticed that his eyes are now back blue but it still has a bit of red in them which means he's thirsty. I let out a sigh of relief as I slowly felt my inner monster vanish inside of me.
I got off of him and sat beside him wondering why he is staring at the ceiling.
"Niall?" I said as I snapped my fingers infront of him trying to get him out of his weird trance.
