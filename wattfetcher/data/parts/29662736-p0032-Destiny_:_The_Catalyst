He had created a complete and perfect life, he had a job as a stockbroker, he had a house and he was called Zac in the surface world. Lucifer had created an illusion where he would fit in the world but when he left, it would be as if he never walked the earth. The devil worked in mysterious ways.
As in the surface world Zac had to absorb energy in order to keep his form, he had to absorb energy from other souls; by draining there, life forces and sometimes the victims even die.
He walked into a dark alley where he felt a great form of dark energy; nothing feels better than sin full humans do. He walked and saw a young boy about the age of twenty or twenty-one. He had murdered his entire family, he sold drugs and raped victims and killed them. He was a perfect one to feed off.
Zac licked his bottom lip and went over to him and grabbed him by his throat, he tried to get free but he was no match for the devil.
You are so full of sin; your soul is so dark, perfect amount of darkness to last off for a few days. The devil looked into his eyes. In addition, within moments his entire body was weak and frail. His skin was thin, his muscles had faded, and he was now a skinny looking men who looked very old.
The devil tossed him aside revealing his devil red eyes, which became black and then its blue color eyes. He smiled to himself and walked away from the dead man lying on the ground.
