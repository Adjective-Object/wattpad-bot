"Give her to me!" He barks. I flinch. I mind link him."I won't until you calm down... When she awakes, do you want her to see you like this?" I say though the link. He takes a deep rigid breath. He slowly calms down enough and I hand him her.
"Call the pack doctor, and tell him to meet me at my house" he ordered. I nodded and jogged back into town. I can't believe I got through to him.
Cameron's POV:I get this strange feeling in the pit of my stomach, then it intensifies."Something's wrong with our mate!" Zach says worried. I am then interrupted by Damien... He tells me there is something wrong with Rosaline. Why is he with her?
When I had spotted them and saw that he was holding her, rage ran through me. He saw my reaction and backed up, with her still in his arms unconscious. I growled at him. Through the mind link he told me to calm down before he hands her to me. I calmed down enough and he gave her to me. She looked lifeless.
I then ordered him to get the pack doctor. As he left I looked down at my mate. She didn't look good. What the hell happened? Once I get her home and checked out, I will be getting answers, one way or another!
