///Romano's PoV! (Chigi. Took you bastards long enough to give me a PoV =.= )///
After we found the metal piece, the four of us--Me, my stupid fratello, the Tomato bastard, and the Potato bastard--headed to the fourth floor of the mansion. There, we planned to inspect the room, when Spain suddenly saw something strange in the corner.
"Whoa! What's that?" Spain asked, pointing to a weird, pudgy white creature.
My brother and I walked closer to where it was. "Was it here before?" Veneziano asked, trying to get the small creature out, but to no avail. "Er...What are we going to do? I can't get it out."
Suddenly, we heard a loud banging sound.
"Argh!!" Veneziano groaned.
The Potato bastard rushed over to us. "H-Hey, are you all right?! Did it attack you?!" he asked my brother.
"Ve... I'm fine... I think." Veneziano replied, shaking his head. He then turned to the creature. "But that sound... it came from this."
The pudgy thing made a loud sound again for some unknown reason.
"What? That sound---Maybe it's hungry?  Why don't we feed it?" Spain suggested, turning to us. What the hell is that bastard thinking?
I crossed my arms and raised an eyebrow at him. "Hungry?! Does that sound like a rumbling stomach to you?!!" I yelled, pointing at the creature that still produced a loud banging sound.
"It looks kinda painful...Do you think it's hungry? Maybe it'll come out if we feed it?" Veneziano said as he searched his pockets. "Oh, but I don't have any food."
The Potato bastard stepped forward. I thought he was going to talk some sense into the two, but then he said, "We could ask them to bring some. Try calling them."
"What, you're still talking about it being hungry? I can't believe this..." I said in disbelief, facepalming.

"Well, now we're going to wait until we're contacted." I announced to my comrades.

I decided to go around and chat with them, as a way of passing the time.
"I can't go anywhere, so I have nothing to do. I'd try making a new cake or something, but the kitchen has been taken over." America told me, pointing at the kitchen area. Giving a nod in sympathy, I headed over to where Prussia was.
Prussia slumped on a chair. "The reception is bad and we can't contact the outside world. We'll have to wait a while. If Italy and the others ask for help, this time we'll all leave together."  he said in a serious tone. I smiled, feeling happy that we're on the same mindset.
"We do get reception once in a while, but it's bad right now. I was talking to them until some time ago." France commented, facing us. He went up to Prussia and started to talk about other things, so I left them be and I went over to Russia instead.
Russia placed his phone back in his pocket. I asked him if it was his sister, he replied, "Belarus? Yeah, I talked to her on the phone. She was surprisingly calm. It looks like she has made new friends. She sounded a little happy." he grinned. I feel a bit odd about his action, though. It's like what he was saying was true, but something was off. Maybe I'm just too paranoid.
"We can't make contact with the outside world. I guess time hasn't been completely fixed, so we'd better keep breaking the clocks." Canada informed me as I approached him.
