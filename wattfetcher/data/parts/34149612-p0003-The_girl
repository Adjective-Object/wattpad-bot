I woke up at 5 o'clock to get ready for after I got out of the shower I brushed my long dark brown hair and put on a pair of dark blue skinny jeans and a black tank top with a white flag shirt with the letters NYC on the front in black. After I was done I grabbed my backpack phone and purse and headed outside to wait for my bestfriend jamie to pick me up for school
