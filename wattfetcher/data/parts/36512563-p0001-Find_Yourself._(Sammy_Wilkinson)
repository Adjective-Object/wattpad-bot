I just finish uploading my video to youtube. And hear my dad walk through the door. I walk down the stairs. Its 3 am. And he's drunk, I can tell by the way that he walks.
"Ally, go to bed. Its late." He slurs. "Come on dad, let's get you to bed." He doesn't object. He takes my arm and I help him up the stairs.
"Why do you do this to yourself dad?" I ask, helping him up the last step."I miss her Ally." He says, instantly making me wish I didn't ask.
"I know daddy, I do to." The rest of the time I help him to his bed is quiet. We don't dare say another word, in fear it would be the wrong thing to say.
"I'll get you some water. Stay here." I pull the blankets up over him and walk to the kitchen.
"Here daddy. Drink this." I hand him the glass and he sips it.
"Thank you for taking care of me hunny." He says, slowly falling asleep. I kiss his forehead and slowly walk back to my room.
It seems like that's all I ever do, take care of him. I'm getting tired of this. I have no one, but him, and he just drinks and works.
*Ring Ring.* "Hello?" I hear him say sleepily."Hey, sorry to call so early. But I need to ask you something." "What's up sis?" He says, clearly more awake."Do you think it would be a bad idea if I moved out?" There's a long pause, him clearly thinking."Did dad come home drunk again?" I pause. "Yes. 3am. He's sleeping now."He sighs. "I think you should fly out here, there's an apartment for rent in the building across from mine. I really don't want you there anymore." He says, moving around."When?" I sigh. I know that it seems wrong to leave him here like this, it feels wrong. But I need to start changing my life.
"Tomorrow. Pack now and leave. I'll book you a ticket now, and you can call dad when you get here. He'll understand." I sigh. "I can't just leave him. What if he comes home one night, and I'm not here to help him? What if he gets hurt?" I say.
"He'll smarten up once he realizes that youre gone. I promise itll be fine. Pack. I'll call you back in 10 minutes." "Okay Chris.."
"I love you Ally."
"I love you too."I hang up and grab the suitcases out if my closet.
I pack all the clothes that I actually wear, and some comfy ones. I grab all my stuff from the bathroom.My camera and tripod. And everything else I'll need.
*ring ring*
"Hey Chris." I answer.
"Tickets booked for 7 am. You'll need to head there now to get there on time." He says.
"The plane ride is about 3 hours, so you can sleep on the flight. I'll be there to pick you up when you land."
"I don't know if I can do this.."I sigh, sitting down on my bed.
"You can do it. I promise. Text me when you get there. I love you."
"I love you too."
I hang up and get changed, stuffing my pajamas into my suitcase.
I walk outside and call a cab.
I get to the airport and text Chris.
'I'm here, just going through security. I love you.'
He instantly texted back.
'Good, I love you, I'll see you in a few hours.'I sigh and put my phone in my pocket and board the plane.
I put my headphones in and slowly drift off.At least I have like no friends to say goodbye too. We just moved.
Goodbye home, goodbye dad.
