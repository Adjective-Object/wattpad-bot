A free spirited young queen. Loves animals and helping people in need. Will even sacrifice her own life to protect animals, families, friends and random strangers. Has the prettiest light and dark blue eyes you could ever get lost in. If you can't tell what that is on the back of her head, its a bow. (I know I suck at drawing bows, dont rub it in XD *cri* lol
