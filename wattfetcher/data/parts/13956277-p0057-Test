So, it's not Damon ...
"Sorry for accusing you" I pulled my bag and went to my room.
Who is he ?
I changed my clothes and unlocked my phone, then jumped on my huge bed.
"OUCH" I sat on a solid thing.
"Who - AAAHHH" I shouted.
Why did you throw it ? that coasts a lot of cash babe, but you deserve way more than this.
lots of love.
-Secret Admirer.
I freaked out.
The same box, same perfume, another paper.
But what scared me the most is that nobody knows that I live with the Carters and what freaked me out is the fact that he could sneak into my room without being noticed by the bodyguards plus, he knew where my room exactly is.
I threw the box out the window and made sure that I broke the perfume bottle and threw the paper across the room.
I noticed something on the back of the paper, so I stood up and pulled it from the floor.
PS : Don't forget to lock your window, we don't want something bad to happen to myÂ cuppycake ... right ?
Now I'm 100% sure it's not Damon.
