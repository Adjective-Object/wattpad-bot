Kellin rolled his eyes, "Fine with me."
"Good." I smiled, "Now lets go explore and drink coffee like basic white boys even though you're the only white one." I said heading out of the coffee shop.
"Where are we gonna go?"
"We could always go to the park."
"Sounds good to me." He said taking a sip of his coffee. So thats what we did we went looking for a park when we finally found one.   He smiled over at me and sat on the park bench looking out at the empty park.
"So here's a question." I said kicking my legs out, "What kind of job can you get as a math major?"
"Biotech, cryptologist, or a math teacher."
"Well, I know what one of those are." I said scrunching my nose.
"It's really cool stuff. Look it up."
"I will later, why would you want to be a math teacher though?"
"I don't know, I really love math and I like to think I would be a great teacher." He said smiling.
"You will. I know it."
"Thanks," He said. "I just don't know if I would ever be able to do it. Like what if I was one of those teachers that everyone hates? I mean no one ever likes math."
"I think you're gonna be great and everyone will love you."
"I might be a biotech or cryptologist those guys are freaking cool so who knows." He said and took a drink of his coffee.
"Well whatever you do you're going to be great at it and I will support you and like- oh my god when do you graduate? I wanna see you get your diploma!"
"I don't graduate for another two years." He said laughing.
"Well I am going to your fucking graduation."
"If I graduate." He muttered.
"You will. Don't worry."
"I doubt it."
"Kellin Quinn if you don't stop being such a Debby Downer I am going to be at the merch table all night tomorrow bugging the hell out of you."
"Okay! I'm gonna graduate and it's gonna be great!"
"That's the spirit!" I said smiling and wrapped an arm around him as I finished up my coffee.
"Woo! Graduation!" He shouted before accidentally spilling his coffee all over me. "Shit! I'm sorry!"
I winced, "It's fine really."
"Vic! Lets get back to the bus or something. I'm so sorry!"
"Kells it's cool, it's just on my shirt."
"I know but let's get back so you can change."
"Alright," I said and pulled off my shirt, I didn't really want to walk around covered in coffee so...
Kellin looked at me wide eyes before coughing a little, "Let's go."
I smirked, "You okay there?"
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"Alright well let's get back then." I told him standing up.
"Yeah, lets get going."
The walk back to the bus was silent but it was a comfortable silence, the whole way back Kellin kept glance over at me blushing which was absolutely adorable. The rosy pink tinge to his cheeks was so cute and it took everything in me to not just lean over and kiss him right then and there.
