Samantha woke up to arguing. She groaned and rolled over trying to get comfortable again. Her eyes shot open when she heard Johnny yell. Sitting up, she tried to focus on what was being said.
"I want to know why I found a pack of razors in the trash this morning!" Tim yelled. Samantha go scared. She quietly went to her luggage and looked through it. Her pack of razors was gone.
"I told you Tim! I threw them away but I can't tell you why!" Johnny yelled. Samantha sat on the floor. He threw them away so she wouldn't harm herself again. She smiled but was drawn back to reality when Tim barged into the room. "Leave her out of this Tim." Johnny yelled.
"Show me your arms." Tim said. Samantha held onto her sleeves and shook her head. "Show me now." Tim said. Samantha stood her ground. Tim reached down and grabbed her arm. He pulled up her sleeve and saw the scars.
"Tim don't!" Johnny said. He just walked in. "Tim. Please don't say anything." He said. Johnny pulled his own sleeves down. Tim saw and dropped Samantha's arm.
"Show me your arms Johnny." Tim said walking towards him.
"I don't have any. I don't know why you would want to know if I had any scars." Johnny said as he backed away from Tim. Johnny ended up next to Samantha, trapped between Tim and a wall. He sighed in defeat. He held out his arms. Tim pushed the sleeves up.
"Really Johnny? I told you had stopped long ago." Tim said quietly. Johnny looked down at Samantha. He shook his head.
"Just once she got here." He said. Tim looked between Johnny and Samantha. He sighed.
"Look. I want you both on this movie but I can't have you two doing that to yourselves. I'm postponing the scenes with you two for now. I want you two to get your acts together. Then come back." Tim said and turned to leave. "Just do it quickly." He said and left. Johnny sighed. Samantha stood up.
"Ok then." She said. Johnny smirked. He rubbed the back of his neck.
"Guess we are in trouble." He said. Samantha laughed.
"You guess? Babe, we know we are in trouble." She said. Johnny smiled and wrapped his arms around her. She fell into his embrace and wrapped her arms around his neck.
"So I guess we go back to the hotel. I don't know what to do from there." Johnny said. Samantha nodded and laid her head on his shoulder.
"I guess. Or we could go back to the states." She said. Johnny sighed.
"Plane." He said. Samantha smiled.
"Or we could stay here. I didn't think you'd remember." She said.
"Remember what?" Johnny asked. He looked down at Samantha.
"I hate flying." Samantha said. She pulled away from johnny and grabbed her suitcase. "Lets go back to the hotel. Then we can figure out what to do."
"Ok." He said and grabbed his own suitcase. They walked off the set and got a cab. Johnny gave the driver the address for the hotel. They were there in less than ten minutes.
"That did not go well. Now what?" Samantha asked once they were in their room. Johnny shrugged.
"Not sure. I already got rid of all the razors except for mine. I need that to shave. Now I guess we just have to fight." He said. Samantha sighed and nodded. She remembered what he said in the trailer.
"Johnny, what did you mean when you said you only stopped once you met me?" She asked. Johnny looked up at her then back down at his lap.
"I uh well exactly what it sounds like. I stopped cutting again once I met you." He said. Samantha shook her head.
