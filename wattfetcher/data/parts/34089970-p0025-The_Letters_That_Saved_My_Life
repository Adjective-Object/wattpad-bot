I rubbed the sleep from my eyes as I pulled my black hair up into a ponytail.
I'm surprised that I didn't have a nightmare tonight... I thought as a rock hit my window. A grin spreads across my mouth as I throw the covers off me. Walking over to my window I slide it open.
"What?" I whisper yell into the cold night.
"Can I come in?" He asks me.
"Yea." I reply. As back up from the window, I felt butterflies erupt in my stomach. In a few seconds Thomas was climbing through the window. Breathing hard he looks at the ground as I quietly shut the window.
"I need to tell you something..." He said as he sat on my bed. Following, I sat beside him. He took a long breathe before continuing.
"My father would abuse me. I was about ten when it started, it ended when I was fourteen. I was soon depressed, not knowing what to do, I would..." I pulled him into my tight embrace.
"I would cut or drink some beer, until I couldn't remember/feel. I was so lost in despair and hopelessness, that all changed when I met you. Robin I love you..." He told me as he wrapped his arms around me.
"I love you too..." I realized as I said the words that they were true.
"I need you to know that some times I might fall apart. I might cry myself to sleep because I miss my mother..." I said into his shoulder.
"Robin I am the one who wrote you letters, I picked you up when you fell, I was always there. I will never leave you, I'll pick you up when you fall down. I will wipe away all of your tears."
"It was you?"
"Yes it was... Can I ask you something?"
I nodded my head.
"Will you, officially, be my girlfriend?"
"Yes, I would love too!" I replied as he kisses my lips. Butterflies erupt in my stomach as I feel like I'm flying. Once he pulls away my lips tingle. He smiles at me as I touch my lips.
