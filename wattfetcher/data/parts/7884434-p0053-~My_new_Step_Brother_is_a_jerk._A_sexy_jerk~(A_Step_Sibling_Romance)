Shea's P.O.V
You know that feeling when everything you do and say is not enough?
How no matter what you do, you'll never be good enough?
Thats how I feel right now.
I lay in my bed, alone. A wet cloth on the newly cut, cuts.
Im crying.
But im silent. The tears are falling, but im too numb to move or react.
Its scary.
I havent been or felt this low in so long..
My heart is racing. At least 190 beats per minute and I can feel every single one try to jump out of my chest. It doesnt even hurt.
I hear a knock on my door, but I ignore it. My doors lock so its not like anyone can come in.
The knocking doesnt stop and I groan and pull the covers over my head.
"Go away" I groan and the knocking stops. I feel my eyes well up with tears and I try to hold them back. The sobbing starts again and I hold myself, trying to be quiet. My head pounding to no end.
"Please Shea.. Let me in.." Seth sobs, his hand on tue handle trying to open it.
He cant just do this to me..
Tell me everything was a mistake, say that this is my fault when in reality, he started it.. He kept going with it..
I love him, and I can feel it in my heart. Its aching to get up and hold him, but I cant.
Me and Seths sobs are in unison. I want to go out there.. I need him..
I slowly get up out of my bed and walk towards the door, slowly unlocking it. I dont even have time to open it, before Seth swings it open and is hugging me in seconds, sobbing against me. I freeze for a minute and hug him back, sobbing against him, repeating im sorry over and over and over again.
His lips meet mine to silence me, and just as they were meant for, i was silent.
This kiss was soft, slow, our lips barely touching.
"God Shea im so sorry.." Seth gets out, his bottom lip slightly quivering like hes going to start crying again.
"Its my fault Seth.. Shhh.." I hold his face softly, his forehead on mine as we stand there holding each other.
"Im such a dick" He says softly into my ear, holding me tighter.
"Seth you didnt let me explain.. Ive been on birth control for about a year now.. My doctor got it for me because my mom wouldn't.. Im not going to get pregnant.." I say to him, as I look into his eyes.
He kisses me softly and his arms snake tight around my waist. "I was so scared Shea.. I came to realize that.. I love you, and I want to have children with you.. I dont see myself with anyone else baby.." I smile and my arms wrap around his neck. I smile up at him and just look into his gorgeous eyes.
"Then we need to tell mom and dad.. because I feel the same way" I whisper softly.
"How Shea..? You know they're not going to approve" He says to me, as he softly runs his nose against mine.
"We just have to do it together.. Thats the only way any of this is going to work out Seth.. I mean your dad stuck up for us before.. He has to now, maybe again support us a little bit.. It'll be okay, i promise." I whisper to him as I softly kiss his nose. He laughs softly and kisses mine back.
"Wanna know whats gonna happen if you're wrong..?" He asks me softly, huskily, and as he pulls my body tighter against his.
