Stop smoking. It fucking ruins your lungs. Stop staying awake for multiple days at a time. You need sleep. Stop saying you don't need people. You know damn well you need them. Stop being so fucking rude. No one deserves to be stuck around you when you're being an asshole. Just stop being a fucking idiot. Stop falling back into wanting death. Just stop.
