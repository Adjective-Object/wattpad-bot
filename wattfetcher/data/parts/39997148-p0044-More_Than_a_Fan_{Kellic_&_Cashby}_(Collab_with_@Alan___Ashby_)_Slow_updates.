"Guys we have to load on the buses we're about to leave." Tino said.
"Alright, see you guys at the venue or if we stop or something." Jaime said.
"But I never got food." I whined.
"You can eat on the bus." Phil said, "Lets go."
"But we only have leftovers." I complained as he started to drag me back to the bus.
"Sucks."
"Whatever." I grumbled and he opened the door.
"Just get in and if you're good I'll ask the driver to stop by McDonalds or something." Tino said rolling his eyes.
"I don't want McDonalds."
"Well then suck it up and eat what we have. We got a three hour drive till the venue."
"Fine, McDonald's it is." I said and sat down on the couch pouting.
"Oh stop pouting." Alan said walking past to the bunks.
"I'll pout all I want." I mumbled to myself.
"Crybaby." He yelled from the bunks.
I huffed and leaned back on the couch. This was going to be a long ride.
