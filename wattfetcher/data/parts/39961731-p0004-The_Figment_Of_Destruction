"She was telling me nonsense. I think she was trying to signal that she's available." Jesse told me.
"Oh." Was all I said before going to my seat. The bell rang for class to start. My biology teacher, Mrs. Brooks, came in front of the class, holding a cardboard box.
"Good morning, class. I bet you're wondering why I am holding this large box. Inside this box, there's a world of dead frogs." Mrs. Brooks said. As expected, there were a lot of "Ew!" and "That's nasty!" going around the classroom.
"Okay, class. I know this is disgusting, but it's a big part of your grade. You and a partner will be dissecting these frogs and identifying the different structures in it. This will be due by the end of class." Mrs. Brooks explained. "Okay now. Find your partner, get a frog, and start dissecting."
Everyone was searching for a partner. I saw a whole group of girls crowd around Jesse. He gently pushed the girls out of his way and came toward me.
"Charlie, wanna work together?" Jesse asked.
"Sure." I agreed. The girls around him groaned and walked away. We put on our gloves and I went to go get the frog.
When I came back to the table, I dropped the frog on the tray. Jesse and I got the tools and started digging in the frog.
"This is disgusting." Jesse complained.
"Dude. This is awesome. Stop whining." I argued while touching the inside of the frog. It felt weird, but amazing.
We were almost done with the project. We were working our way through the frog until Jesse's hand covered mine. We both stared at each other for a while, then I quickly pulled my hand away. We continued on the project, acting like nothing happened, but when I looked up to see Jesse, he looked upset.
(Hey again!! Sorry if this chapter was long. To warn you guys, these chapters may be usually long because of the way I add things to the story. Anyway, hope you're enjoying the book a bit. Don't forget to vote and comment. Baii .xx)
