"Whoever killed my brother will pay." He lowered his chin at the ant sized people below him that walked along the sidewalk and in and out of buildings, minding their own business. "And so will anyone who tries to ruin me. I will never be the one that suffers ever again. It will be them that suffers, always them. Always them, never me. Always them, never me . . ."
The moment from his past ended, and he shook his head.
Maybe mending things instead of destroying them for once will be good for me. Always them, always me, always everyone.
