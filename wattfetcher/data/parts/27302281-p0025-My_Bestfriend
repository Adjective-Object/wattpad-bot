End of flashback
Then I got up and unlocked the door then crawled back under my blanket  and I felt him crawl up beside me
I can't push him away I love him too much he's my rock he's my weakness I need him even if he's the reason for my tears
" go away " I sobbed
" no" he said  against my neck
" justin what is selena to you " I cried out
" nothing I dated her before you and she won't leave me alone I stopped dating her months before you before Blair  she was my first love but she cheated on me cause I wouldn't sleep with her  she wants me back but I told her I have a girlfriend that I love " he said with a lot of emotion  in his eyes
" justin  I'm sorry I slapped you" I said   touching his cheek where I slapped him
" its ok "   he said flinching at my touch
"  no its not I left a mark " I said planting a kiss on it
" sorry " I said blushing
" its fine " he said looking at me with love in his eyes
Then I kissed his cheek again and froze there and justin leaned in and kissed my lips
" I love you" he said
" I love you too"  I said back kissing him again  and trying not to touch the mark I left on his cheek
"  its fine " he said   catching me looking at it
" does it hurt " I said
" only when you touch it " he said
"    well I'm gonna go in there " he said getting up
" justin " I said stopping him
" stay with me " I said scared
" are you sure " he said
" its still storming " I said   helplessly
" ok " he said laying under the blanket with me and  pulling me to his chest
" don't leave me " I said looking up at him
"  I won't I promise " he said kissing me softly
