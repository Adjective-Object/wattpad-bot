I'm extremely sorry, I had no Internet connection at all! I couldn't update I'm so sorry, but I promise to update soon.
But please vote and comment.
I only got 78 votes and I reached 1K that's a small number compared to the number of readers.
Oh and thanks for the 1K ily guys.
Can I get 3 votes and 2 comments to update today?
