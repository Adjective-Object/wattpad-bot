After I hung up with Chase's mom I walked in Kohl's. Anna saw that I had walked in and came over to me. "Oh my gosh! I saw the cutest dress - you should get it!" She grabbed my wrist and took me to the section where sundresses were in the junior section. "Why must I get it? Why not you?""Because I don't have a reason to get a sundress!""And I do?""Yes! Dinner this evening with your family! You could totally rock this one!" Anna said as she pulled a dress of the rack and took my wrist again and put me in a dressing room. "While you're trying that on - I'll go look for some more!"Withen a few minutes Anna was back jiggling the handle on the door so I would unlock and open it. "What do you think?" I asked as I open the door for her to see."That is the one! I was going to have you try these on," she nodded her head to about ten dresses in her arms, "but the one you're wearing is just perfect for the occasion!""Thank you! Now, as I chase out of it," I shut and locked the dressing room door, "I need to tell you something.""Okayy...""Okay, so you know when I was on the phone with his mom? Well I told her that when we were done here we'd go to the track. And I explained because Ryan wanted to eat lunch with you. And then she said that is not really get much time with Chase because he had an interview, he would be in and out of the car, and he also had meet and greets and fan appearances. So she then asked me to lunch.""What?!""Anna! Quiet down! But yeah. So, during lunch, I figured I'd tell her about my plan of having him have dinner with my family."
