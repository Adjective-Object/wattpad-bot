I worked damned hard to get my story to perfection. I know it's not there yet. I know it probably never will be.
But I at least wanted some goddamn recognition for my hard work.
I pestered several critics. I edited time and time and time again. I changed things and fixed them and made a world I came to love.
But according to Wattpad, that isn't enough.
See, in order to be in the Wattys, my story needs to be thirty Wattpad pages long.
First of all... That's sixty Microsoft office pages.
Second of all, right now, my manuscript sits at 42 word document pages. On here, it's only twenty. I'm ten Wattpad pages short.
In order to be eligible, I need to add twenty Microsoft pages worth of details and dialogue and SHIT, JUST to be eligible. And it has to be done in three days. That's not fair! I built and developed my world and my characters as best as I could. I worked HARD to get them to where I have them. I know it's not perfect, but I spent all this time and energy for an event, just to turn around and be told, "Nope, can't enter. Your entry isn't long enough."
Where the hell is the recognition I deserve for working so hard? Do I need to make my fingers bleed even MORE? If so.... then I just don't know.
This seriously makes me want to just STOP. Makes me want to step back away from Wattpad, away from writing, and just stop. Is all this work really getting me nowhere?
This isn't... this isn't fair. It's really not. Not to me, not to any other writer that isn't eligible. It's not fair to ANYONE except the fanfic writers, and I'm fucking sick of this communist community.
Maybe I should just lock my pens in a drawer and never write again. Not like I'm really all that good, anyway.
