Long live the frunas! Don't know what they are, they are Spanish candies. Delicious ones, might I add. Here's photo of them.
Never mind. Tried, won't work. Oh well. I'll change the cover to show what they are or write a book about them or something. Anyways peace out. And that girl on the cover is not me. She's my neighbor and friend. Ok? Bye!:)
