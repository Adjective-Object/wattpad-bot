srry i had a bit of sugar i think sooooooooooo what's up my Halo's? Its Angel here and that failed badly...... uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh happy fathers day??? for sunday though not today. i dissected a cow eyeball yumm(eww i almost threw up like Anna my friend) my dad's birthday is on fathers day. and he got new car freshener and it smells just like his Camaro ('89 Z28 i think) and it brings back sooooooo many memories its not funny. even typing this i am about to cry 'cause i loved (and still love) those cars ( my mom had one too) they met in those cars!! the most clear memory is on the old airport road that we live like right beside, i remember being like 8 yrs and sitting up front 'cause we boss like that and i remember him doing a burnout and me smiling all the way. the guy that we sold my moms Cami (Camaro) to ruined the tranny going up the trailer in third gear. the guy that we sold my dads cami to took the Nitrous system out because he was scared. and he took the window stickers that my dad earned from racing ( yes he raced before he met my mom) he took them off. at least the dood we sold the cami to lives in our town that we work in so i still get to see it on our way home. i am thinking of doing lots of 'that moment when's tomorrow and then doing 'a few facts you probably didn't know about me' on sunday soo00ooo000oooo0000. this is Angel and i will see you Halo's later byee:)
