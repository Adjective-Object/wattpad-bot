"No, no. I'm showering before you." I said walking up behind him and wrapping my arms around him.
"No you're not!" He said pushing away from me, "Now let me go!"
"Nope not unless you let me shower first because if you don't then I'm gonna lay in your bunk while I'm all sweaty and gross."
"Austin Carlile let go of me this instant or else!" He yelled.
"Or else what?"
"Or else I will never kiss you again and you will be in so much trouble."
"Well can I shower first?"
"No you can't."
I sighed, "Fine."'
"Thank you." He said smugly, "Now let go of me."
"Only if you kiss me."
"No. You're all gross and sweaty."
"Then I can't let you go."
"Austin!" He whined.
"Please."
"Maybe."
"Come on, baby please."
"Fine."
"So if I let you go, you'll kiss me."
"Yes, if you let me go." He said.
I let him again and he turned around, "I was just kidding." He said before quickly getting to the bathroom and shutting the door.
"Alan you're an ass!" I yelled banging on the door.
"Oh I know."
"I'm laying on your bed."
"If you do that, then I'm not letting you in my bunk nor am I going to kiss you anytime soon."
"You're mean." I whined.
"Well you still are in trouble."
"Well now you're in trouble too." I said and went to his bunk where I laid down just to piss him off. I laid there for a good twenty minutes before he came back in just a towel.
"You're mean to me and I forgot clothes." He said glaring at me and grabbing random clothes from his bunk and walked away.
"I'm not the mean one." I called after him.
He came back again dressed and pouting, "I'm sleeping in your bunk now and you're taking mine."
"Uh no you're not. That's my bunk and I'm not sharing." I told him getting out of his bunk, "I have an emotional attachment to this bed we've been through a lot together."
He rolled his eyes, "Okay sure. Just go shower."
"Promise to stay out of my bunk?"
"No."
"Stay away from my bunk Ashby." I told him heading to the bathroom.
"No!"
I sighed and just went into the bathroom showering quickly and walking back to my bunk with my towel wrapped around me.
"You're in my bunk."
"Yes I am." He said smirking.
I reached in and grabbed my clothes, "Might wanna turn away. Don't want you freaking out again." I said smirking, "It's kind of a big deal."
