Our friend sucks his teeth at us and continues messing with his equipment. You gotta love him--and his age.

Song: God must of spent (a little more time on you)
Justin's P.O.V
[Nsync]
"...Your love is like a riverPeaceful and deep (peaceful and deep)Your soul is like a secretThat I never could keep
When I look into your eyesI know that it's trueGod must have spent...
A little more timeOn you...(on you, on you, on you, you..)
God must have spent...A little more timeon you(on you, on you..you....you..oooh..yeah)
A little more timeon you...ohhh."
"Cut! Cut! Clear the set," the director orders from his chair. I sigh deeply after working on this music video for days. I like the song though. It's sweet and smooth. I walk off the set and wipe the sweat off my forehead. It is super hot! So hot, that I might have a meltdown!
"Yo, JT--do you have plans tonight," JC asks me from behind, holding my shoulders.
"I don't know man. Maybe I'll just chillax on my couch and watch the Chicago Bulls game tonight," I say exhausted.
JC continues, "Well, me and the fellas are about to go to some party that Joey mentioned. Wanna go?"
"I think I'll pass," I reply honestly. He eyes me in doubt, crossing his arms.
"Are you sure man? You look like you can use a cold beer." He questions. He ain't lying. I have sleepiness written all over my face. I can feel my eyes burning from these bright ass lights on the set. Still, I'm not even in the mood for partying or girls.
"Yeah I'm sure. Thanks for asking though JC but; not tonight," I answer, backing away from him and swinging around, on my way to the dressing room.
"Aw you suck Timberlake."
"That's my name. Don't wear it out," I shout without looking back. Then, my manager is walking towards me. I stop at my tracks and notice that he is sided with Lance.
"Hey Justin, I want to talk to you about something," Johnny tells me with a phone in his left hand. I feel my curly hair blow to the (not helping) fan.
"Uh yeah sure, what's up?"
"21 Under 21 magazine wants you on the cover along with Lance and popular female artist known as Aaliyah. You free?" He notifies me grinning.
"Eh I guess."
"I take that as a yes then Justin. Do you want to participate in it?"
"Uhh sure. That will be great! I am excited for this photoshoot just thinking about it!" I lie successfully, jumping up and down.
I guess they can't tell my sarcasm since they are ecstatic about it. In the inside; hell no I don't want to go. With all due respect--I like Aaliyah. I think that she is a fine artist. I heard some of her songs but never met her in person. I don't even know what she look like to be honest. But, I just want some time alone for once.
