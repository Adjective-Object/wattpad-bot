There is a knock at the door and both Jeff and I stop and turn.
Jeff runs into his room and comes back with a long knife. He approaches the door, knife in hand, and opens the door.
A man jumps down from the cellar door and Jeff drops the knife to hug him.
"Make yourself at home, Toby." Jeff offers and the man nods and walks in. The man wears orange goggles, and a mask to cover his mouth. He is dressed in a hoodie and jeans. He removes the mask to reveal that his cheek has been practically mutilated, as it exposes his teeth. He smiles at Jeff.
"Not much has changed around here.." He says, walking around as I stand still in the kitchen. "Apart from that." He focuses his attention on me and points a hatchet at me. "What is that?" He cracks his neck.
"It's a girl."
"Well no shit, Jeff. I mean what is she doing here."
"She's my guest." Jeff tells him.
"You don't take in guests." Toby responds and cracks his neck. Oh god that sound is disturbing.
"She's one of us, don't worry."
What does he mean, one of us?
"Toby, this is Lena. Lena, Toby." Jeff pushes Toby closer to me.
Toby lifts his goggles off his eyes and places them on his head. "Hi." He shakes my hand and cracks his neck.
"H-hi." I smile.
"I don't see how you could be one of us," He cracks his neck. "You look way too good." He smiles.
I smile. "Thank you."
Jeff pushes Toby back. "That's enough Toby, you have a girlfriend after all."
"Clockwork is on a constant fucking period." Toby says to him. "She's mad at me because I didn't go on a killing with her last week. Plus your little friend here looks a hell of a lot better."
"Anyways, it's good to see you, man. I haven't seen you in months. Where have you been?" Jeff asks.
They continue their little conversation while I walk back to my room.
"Where are you going?" Jeff asks me.
"To my room." I tell him.
"Oh no." He snakes his arm around my waist and leads me back out. "We have work to do."
"Huh..?" I ask, confused. Jeff pays no attention and turns to Toby.
"How 'bout a killing, Toby?" Jeff asks him. Oh no.
Toby pulls out a second hatchet and smiles. "Hell yeah."
