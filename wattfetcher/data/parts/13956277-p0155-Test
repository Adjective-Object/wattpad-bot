....
" What ?" I asked Damon as we sat on a table in a cafe, "That's why we moved, I heard him talking on the phone with some people and they want YOU and Simon dead" My eyes widened, how come ? How could such a gentleman like Mr.Carter have a hand in such a filthy thing, "You do actually know that me and Simon want every responsible person in jail, don't you ?" He nodded.
"I want him in jail too, I hated the fact that all the money I was spending and playing with came from filthy work. It's a hard thing to snitch on your dad, but that's the right thing to do" Damon rubbed his eyes to stop his tears from dropping.
......
"Where are you going ?" Karam asked, oh, nowhere, I'm just going to meet the minister and talk about the orphans that are being used for filthy things. Nah. "I'm going to meet Molly, I told you about her, the one that have become Muslim" I had to lie.
.....
"Ready ?" Me and Simon were standing in front of the Ministry building beside Nina's sister, Simon nodded and opened the door for me.
"Have a seat, the Minister will be here in seconds" A man guided us to huge room with a rounded table and red seats around it.
"I've heard about the story you are promoting and the huge effort you are giving. So, tell me everything" And we obeyed his command.....
"Do you have any names ?" The Minister asked, "I've heard them mention someone with a C in his name, they said that he lives near" Nina's sister said, and Mr.Carter popped in my head, the wise, honest, generous and old man. I hesitated for seconds but finally...
"It's Mr.Carter, the one with the huge villa in 76 street" I spat it out, The Minister and Simon gasped, "WHAT?" They both were surprised, "Yes, Yes, that's him" Nina's sister said, "But it's not only him, he has many supporters around the U.S.A, there are many other orphans suffering" She continued.
"How come ? He's one of the most famous businessmen ! He does uncountable charity works. How did you know this information?" The Minister asked, "Isn't he Damon's father? Or Am I wrong ?" Simon asked and I nodded.
"I guess everything is clear now, My men will take over this thing. But we should know where their main residence is" The Minister said, "They are probably under the Hospital Mr.Carter owns" Nina's sister said, My phone buzzed, I took it out and it was a message from Damon, My eyes widened.
"NO, they are leaving the state, they are heading to Chicago in huge vegetable transferring trucks so they don't gain attention and there are people helping them on the borders of states, we have t hurry up if we want to catch them before they disappear" I said quickly, "How did you know all of this ?" The Minister asked, "It's another story, now we have to hurry up" I said and the Minister called all of his men and the national security men. Ten minutes and they were ready in their cars and gone out of sight.
"Do you think they will make it ?" Nina's sister asked worriedly, "I hope so" I hugged her tightly.
.....
Ten hours later, my phone rang, "Hello, yes ... yes, we will" I said. Me, Simon, Nina, Molly and Simon were gathered in Simon's house.
"What ?" They all asked in sync.
"WE DID IT YEEEAAAAHHHH" I jumped in happiness, so did all of them, then suddenly I couldn't feel my feet touching the ground, Simon carried me and spun me around while laughing, "WE DID IT" He screamed then put me down, "Yes we did ... But don't touch me again" I felt pain in my stomach and I ran to the toilet and vomited.
