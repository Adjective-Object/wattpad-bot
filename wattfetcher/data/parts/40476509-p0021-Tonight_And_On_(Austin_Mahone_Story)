"Well the flashback showed Zach starring at me constantly, you catching Zach starring at me and you giving him the "back the fuck off bitch" face, then Becky being Zach's cousin, Zach bringing Becky all of a sudden, and last but not least you and Becky making out on my bed" I said as I started to get really angry at the end making furious face with making fists with my hands.

I looked back at the road and realized I missed the red light and there was a car still moving towards my car.
I quickly hit the breaks trying to stop the car but it was too late. My life flashed before my eyes.
