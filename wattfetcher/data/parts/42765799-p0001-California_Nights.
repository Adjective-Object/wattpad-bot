"See, that wasnt so bad was it?" I didnt really care what Paris was talking about at the moment, right now I was to busy worshipping the ground. "Sweet, Sweet ground. Oh how I missed you!"
I placed my body onto the cold floor of the airport and layed there thanking god our plane didnt crash. "Literally Sasha? We're in a public place and people are staring for CHRISTS SAKE!" Did this bitch really think I cared what people thought? I almost lost my life on that damn plane!
I dont give not one fuck what anyone thought about me laying on the floor, Hell I dont give a fuck about the germs on it either. All that matters is that I'm alive.
I dont know why I allowed my 'best friend' to drag me on that death trap. "If we would've drove to LA like I had suggested you wouldnt be going through this embarrassment. " Her back was to me but I knew she heard me, Lil bitch cant pretend to not know me. "PARIS! PAAARIS! BITCH WITH THE BLACK WEAVE!" That got her attention then because she turned around with a mortified expression which, in all honesty, caused me to laugh.
" Sasha! Why cant you act civilized? Never again will I come on a trip with you. Get your shit and c'mon." Seeing as she already had her bags, I got up and went to go get mine aswell, after dusting off my clothes ofcourse. Then we headed out of the airport.
California was hot as hell, The sun gave no mercy. But here we are, At this wannabe Sahara Desert for vacation. Two 19 year old Black females ( okay maybe I'm half ) who will more than likely gain a little more melanin after this little trip.
