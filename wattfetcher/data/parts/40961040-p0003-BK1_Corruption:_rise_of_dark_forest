"I can't" I stammered. She smiled.
"You have to or they'll find out" she whispered.
"You know that..." She silenced me and smiled.
"I know all boy...now kiss me" she commanded. She leaned in and I met her, I kind of got carried away and pushed her against my truck, she put a leg around my waist and I deepened the kiss. This us vetting real and I can't stop! I kissed Down her neck earning a moan. Out the corner of my eye I saw the guys backing up confused. My phone rang perfect! I quickly stepped away and answered.
"Hello?" I said, slightly annoyed.
"Its your mother" I silently groaned.
Fuck off. "Yes?"
"Come home I'm cooking graduating dinner" she squealed. Oh god.
"OK I'll be there" I hung up and turned towards the guys. "How long have you been there?" They looked at one another, Scott was the one to answer. Oh my god boner.
"A little while" he said, eyeing me. I nodded. Angle leaned on my truck and snickered.
"Its not what it looks like" I chocked. "I wasn't about to screw a random crush". Seconds went by. "I'm a horrible lier."
Scott nodded. "Chris, Lem said you were.....well.....a man liler?" I froze blinking. This was it, I could come out or stay in the closet. What do I do?
