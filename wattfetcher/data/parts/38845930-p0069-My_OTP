"I bet I missed you just as much if not more." She said in a little mumble.
"Doubt it... highly." I said.
"Really? Because I couldn't fall asleep thinking about how I didn't call... and left you to wonder what I was doing." She said.
"Wow."
"Yeah, I was almost crying and at one point I called but hung up before it could ring so I didn't wake you up." She said.
"Well, I wish you called." I said.
"Me too." She said as she cried.
"Can we stop bringing it up?" I asked not noticing she was crying.
"Yes!" She cried into her pillow.
"Erin? Did I make you feel bad?" I asked.
"No I wish I would have called!" She said letting tears escape her eyes.
"You can call no matter what time it is. Please call... no matter what time it is or where you are, please call. I love you." I said hoping I could make her feel better.
"I wish I called you!" She said again.
"Please -- it's okay. You don't have to obsess over it, just stop worrying." I said.
"I should have called." She said rubbing her eyes.
"Don't obsess."
"I wish I called." She said again.
"Okay, now it's annoying." I said.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." She said.
"It's okay, baby. Please stop."
"I love you too." She said snuggling up against me still crying.
"Don't cry... please." I said putting my hand in her hand.
She fell asleep and cuddled me all night, I cuddled her back. "Baby?" I asked when she started to move, the look on her face of confusion was bold. "Erin?" I asked. I desided to try and fall asleep at around 3 a.m.
