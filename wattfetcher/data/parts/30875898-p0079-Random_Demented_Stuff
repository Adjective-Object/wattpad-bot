I knew a boy who liked to draw
He drew pictures that nobody saw
He was most artistic late at night
He drew his pictures out of sight
He kept this secret and no one knew
And his gallery of pictures grew and grew
His drawings were different no paper or pen
Only a bandage every now and again
One night we stood by the river under the stars
He rolled up his sleeves and showed me his scars
He was embarrassed and looked at his shoes
I smiled and whispered, "I draw with broken mirrors too."
