"Wake up sweetie, it's time for breakfast" my mum says. I hate the mornings. I turn over in my bed, switch on my phone and instantly go onto Twitter. 'OMG' Paul zimmer just favourited another one of my tweets! I jump unwilling out of my bed and throw on the cutest thing left in closet. I run downstairs, quickly eat my breakfast and sprint to the bus. At my school, if your not popular, your nobody! This was me. I had the best set of friends, and to be honest I didn't mind not being popular. It was just being judged every time you walked down the corridor. School slowly came to an end, everyone was jumping and screaming, adrenaline pumping throw the hallways, people shouting at the top of their lungs "schools out, party time! Woop woop!" As I had expected, I wasn't invited to any of the parties, but that didn't matter, because I was going to Paul Zimmers meet and greet!
