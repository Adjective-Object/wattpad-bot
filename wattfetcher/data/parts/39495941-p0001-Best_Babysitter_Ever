My parents thought I needed a babysitter. I was only 17.  I just went along with the plan. I wondered who was coming to stay with me while they were gone.  " Criss is on his way," my dad told me.  Criss Angel was not only my best friend, he was a magician. I was so excited to see him. He was even staying the night. My 14 year old sister was at her boyfriend's home.  Once my parents and my 9 year old sister left, I was alone for a while. I wanted my Criss. I watched Rupaul's Drag Race on the couch until I heard a knock at the door. " Who is it?" I sang like Michael Jackson. " Criss," the voice giggled as I opened the door. I jumped in his arms and hugged him. " Missed you," he whispered. I smiled as he carried his things and me into the house. He smiled and put me on the floor. He went to shower before we could find a way to pull pranks on people. We decided to go put a bucket of eggs on my cousin's car door and see if he noticed. We hid in a tree. Criss pulled the rope and the eggs went all over him. We laughed running to my house. "You're a bad influence on me," I said as I kissed his cheek . " I know, that's my job," he said. " Smartass!" I stated as I punched his arm. He pouted. He was so cute when he pouted. We went to my room and cuddled close together on my bed.  " Me and Sandra are over," he told me as he stroked my hair. " Why?" I asked him. " Well, she cheated and she thought that I was spending more time with you, my Kayla," he said. " Girl bye!" I shouted.  He laughed his head off.
