I slowly opened my eyes and felt rough shoves on my back. Prim laid on my lower back while messing around. I gently pushed her off of me and sat up.
I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed and jumped out of bed, shocked at the fact that I slept until eight twenty-six!
I always get to work by right on the dot. I changed in nearly ten seconds and was already putting my hair in a ponytail by eight twenty-seven. I spat out the taste of toothpaste from my mouth and poured food and water for Percy and Prim.
I slipped on my black combat boots and ran out the door. I had a full body impact with I'm guessed was a man. I skittered to the floor and immediately jumped up again and helped the man pick up his bags.
"Sorry! I'm so sorry, I really am, sir," I stammered, handing him a luggage. He grunted and brushed the hair out of his eyes.
I felt my mouth fall open. He has long brown hair that falls down to just below his neck, or around there. He has thick brown eyebrows and a bushy brown beard. He has the kindest, warmest most mischievous, brown eyes I've ever seen. His pink full lips that part into a breathtaking smile.
Blood rushed up to my cheeks and I felt my ears burn red. "Yeah... It's alright, I guess," He ran a hand through his long silky brown hair.
And his voice... Ooh boy. I nodded, averting my gaze to a huge wad of pink bubblegum on the sidewalk. He cleared his throat and I timidly looked up.
"Ma'am, do you know where Comfort Suites are? You know, the apartment building?" He asked, scratching his chin.
I nodded and felt my heart beat louder and faster. That's where I live. I raised a slightly shaking hand and pointed to a corner. "It's over that way, you'll see a red building, the one next to it," I said quickly.
He nodded and called another guy. He walked over and I studied him. He's average height, with grayish-black hair that sticks up in all directions in the front. He has steady, solid blue eyes. A kind smile. Seemed like a nice guy.
"Okay Q, let's go," He smiled, and off the blue eyed man and "Q" went. I stared after them and then remembered why I was running in the first place.
I bolted to my car and drove exactly one mile under the speed limit. I got to the vets building and ran inside, checking myself in.
I got to my office and say in my black comfy rolling chair. Jake walked in and gave a start to see me there. "What you doing here?" Jake asked, surprised.
I rolled my eyes. "Jake, I work here. Any check ups?" I asked, wanting to start the day already. Jake ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
"Ten years of working here and you still refuse to take one day off," He muttered, his face darkening with mood.
I glared at him and repeated my question. "Yeah... A hedgehog needs his monthly visit checked," Jake said reluctantly, after checking his clipboard.
"Got it," And with that said, I stood up and went to check up on Sonic (I like that name, reminds me of the game) the hedgehog.
After my day was done at around eight at night I stayed two extra hours because I'm not in any rush to get home. I finally turned to Jake who again was watching me.
"Why do you watch me?" I asked, irritated and frustrated from the day. Jake shrugged. "Just wondering about you," He whispered, and left.
I let that sink in then I left. I got to my building and checked my mail. Bill... Bill... Bill... Greetings card? I opened up the card and saw it was addressed to room three-B, I'm three-A.
