When i was really little I had a dream where I was with my mom and there was just a random electricity pole. Then I saw a weird bat thing on top of it and then there were more I me and my brother (which my mom magically turned into) started running away. Then they jumped on my brother. So to me my brother was the person I followed around and asked him before I do something and trusted him. That meant I was basically freaking out! I was just screaming and running. When I woke up I looked around and there were no giant fruit bats and my brother was not being attacked by the non-existent giant fruit bats. Also my mom wasn't doing any magic tricks. Plus I didn't get a fear a bats so I'm not batman.
