ARIANA'S POV
This chapter is dedicated to @RickyCarson1
So its been 1 year and three months since my last tour.Â  I don't think I'll be going on any tours any time soon, why?, you may ask. Well....I now have a daughter, her name is Riley Samoy Lynch, she's my pride and joy but she's also damn annoying.I haven't slept in eight freaking days because of her constant crying. She's seven and a half months old and she eats way too much...at least that's what I think.Tomorrow, the whole family is traveling to Oklahoma to visit Ross' aunt, I was told that her name is Joan, that's my moms name too and I was told that she's not the nicest person on earth but she can't be that bad.....right?. Ross, Riley and I are currently at our house in California, after Riley was born we decided to move away from everyone else, Jordyn and Madison are dance camp for six more months, that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned cause three kids is just too much to handle.
Ross - Hey
Ariana - Hi
Ross - Is she sleeping?
Ariana - Yeah, but be really quiet, I DONT want her to wake up as yet.
Ross - Why dont you go get some rest?, you look like hell
Ariana - Are you sure?
Ross - Yeah
Ariana - But what if she wakes up while I'm sleeping?
Ross - I'll handle it
Ariana - No!, I mean...no..if she wakes up, just call me. Ok?
Ross - Ok??
Its not that I'm being selfish or anything with the baby.....but I definitely don't want anything to happen to Riley, she's my first child and I dont want to lose her. Point is...I dont trust Ross with Riley and to tell the truth he's never held her since she's been born and I'm planning on keeping it that way.
