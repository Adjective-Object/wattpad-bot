Natasha POV
I walked around my job forever21 picking up the shirts laying around on the floor when I felt someone staring at me I  picked the last shirt up hanging it then turned around to see this girl right infront of me I gasped backing up some. She smirked and Said " hey my names ruby what's yours?" I moved out of her way and replied " my names Natasha....as it says on my name tag." She Chuckled nodding and said " yea...I suppose so." " do you need any help?" I asked looking at her. She shook her head " nah." I walked to the Register watching her grab shirts and shorts. She finally walked to the register I rung her stuff up. " 57.89" I said she handed me her card grabbing her bag I  swiped it and handed it back to her. " have a nice day' I said smiling at her. She smiled back " you two beautiful." She kissed my cheek I smiled and blushed. My bestfriend Aaleeyah walked to me smirking " what?" I asked walking around to her she rolled her eyes " you know what. I saw that." I shook my head " I have no idea what you're talking about."  " bulllllll shit. Your cheeks are red as a rose" I ignored her comment thinking about ruby. She seems interesting . I walked behind Aaleeyah as she talked to her girlfriend lyric they've been together for 2 years and still going strong. I walked to Wendy's getting my money from my purse seeing a paper with a number and under it  ruby call me sometime beautiful   I smiled and grabbed my food walking to Aaleeyah
