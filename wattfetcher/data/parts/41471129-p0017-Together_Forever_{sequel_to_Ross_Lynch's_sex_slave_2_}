Ross - You're lying
Ariana - I'm fine, its nothing really, I was just...thinking about Jordyn and Madison
I knew that she wasn't telling the truth but I didn't really want to upset her so, I just shrugged it off
Ross - You sure?
Ariana - What?
She pulled away from the hug and looked at me confused
Ross - I asked if you're sure
Ariana - Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm sure, I'm fine
Ross - You hate it here, dont you?
Ariana - Well I do but-its OK really
She said obviously forcing a smile
Ross - ok, um...where did Rocky, Sammi and Riker go?
Ariana - They all went to the park or a fair or something like that
Ross - Didn't they say they were sick?
Ariana - Well they weren't, appearantly, they were just trying to get out of going to the beach with Joan
Ross - Oh. How's Riley?
Ariana - She's fine, it looks like she's really tired today though, after you left she woke up and after like....half an hour, she went back to sleep
Ross - Oh, cool
Ariana - Um....wanna do something fun?
Ross - Yeah.......um...sure...
Ariana - Let's go swimming?
Ross - K then
Well that was just......awkward.....

Hello fellow earthlings.
Questions : Can someone please explain to me what writers block is?? and let's say...your friends locked you inside the janitors closet with a REALLY cute guy, technically, your boyfriend is in another country right now and you guys are on a break. You really like this guy and while you're locked in there you guys start talking and after a while he leans in to kiss you. What would you do?
MY ANSWER : It happened to me and ...I kissed him, there's nothing wrong with that...right?. As far as I see it, my boyfriend and I are on a break right now so...technically...we're not dating right now, therefore...its OK for me to see other people. Right?
