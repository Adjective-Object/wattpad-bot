People need to gain your trust because you are weary of trusting anyone. The only person you fully trust is yourself, and you trust your own instincts more than anything. You try to appear calm and collected, but you've got intense emotions brewing underneath. You are constantly trying to understand your emotions while you try to keep your feelings under control and hidden from the outside world. You are passionate and you refuse to fail, but you also have a fear of failure which you keep hidden very well. You have a warrior spirit, but sometimes you feel like a solitary warrior in a very cruel world.
