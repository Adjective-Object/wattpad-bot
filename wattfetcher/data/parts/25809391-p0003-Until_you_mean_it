The Epistle of Avril's Staggering Beauty. I cursed silently and rushed to the bathroom and slammed the door and sank to the floor.
I was neither physically nor mentally prepared for my first day of university.
Well..... at least the part where I had to face all those people I knew absolutely nothing about.
Academically wise I was fully prepared, I wanted to become a criminal lawyer and nothing could stop me.
I took my time in the bathroom instead of my normal shower, I filled the tub with water and poured jasmine in it. I stripped myself slowly and and wrapped a towel around my body and brush my teeth. I then shave my legs even though it was done two days ago. I have to look stunning for my first day even though it won't be effortlessly. Well I guess Beyonce was right, pretty do hurts.
After all that beautification. I tested if the water was warm and I sunk to the bottom of the tub, dreading my first day.
A/N : Hey!! *waves hand* so I'm new here. This is my first story and I'm just so excited about it. So I'd like all of you guys to comment and vote. Just tell me what you think so far.
