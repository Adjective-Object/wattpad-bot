~EvanHere I am outside her door with red roses and chocolate and ready to beg for  forgiveness , and this time I know she is here I saw her come home from work looking really pissed. I'm hoping she will forgive me and not slap the life out of me.So here goes nothing *knock knock*On the other side of the door I could hear a faint damn "Hold on I'm coming" said Ashley "Hel...why the hell are you here""To apologize""An apology does not make it better""I know that but its worth a try I don't want to lose you since you came into my life you've changed me for the better I use to be a womanizer..." She cut me off"You still...""Please let me finish its important that I get this off me chest at this very moment I am sorry....I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart  if you still don't believe me let me take you out on a proper date I'll keep my distances and your in charge only if you agree beautiful"She took longer then I expected to answer "Evan I believe you but I'll only go on a date with you if you answer my question"I was on cloud 9 at the moment I couldn't stop smiling "Okay what's your question""Why did you kiss me did you kiss me just to shut me up""I kissed you because you looked so beautiful I couldn't help myself and the way you were staring at me I couldn't wait any longer to feel your soft lips again I'm sorry and I really didn't mean to laugh you just looked so shocked it was either laugh or take that shocked look and turn it into a pleasured look""Okay I forgive you what time are we going out""Your in charge you decide ""Hmm how about later tonight at 8:00 down at the pin house restaurant does that sound good""Its always good if your there see you later tonight "I said and leaned it for a kiss in her Cheek and she pushed my face away"What""You said you'll keep your distance""Oh right sorry bye beautiful""Bye"Thank god that went well I didn't expect her to say yes but now that she did I have a whole new reason to be happy because I got a second chance at loveThat's my first time saying it I'm in loveI'm in love with my beautiful
