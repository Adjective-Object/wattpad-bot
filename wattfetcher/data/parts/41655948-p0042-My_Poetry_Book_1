I can't even sing the lyrics right
Because all I think about is 'one more night'
Until on our own is how we'll have to fight.
I can't stop the tears from falling from my eyes
As my entire body begins to turn to ice.
You're the only one who has the power to save me,
And even just a week without you will fade me.

I wrote this for someone and that someone should be reading and they'll know who they are. xx
