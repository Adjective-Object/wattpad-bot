I finish season 4 and look at the time to see its 5:30 pm. Already? I think my phone is in my room. I go upstairs and check the bathroom and see it lying on the sink. Found you! I press the home button and see several messages from Mom and a missed call from Dad. Shit I'm dead! I slide to open the home screen and call dad back.
"Alex? Finally you answered! I was beginning to get worried."
"Yeah I know sorry! I was watching Netflix and my phone was in the bathroom haha."

I got off and read 4 missed messages from mom:
MOM: Hey how's it going?
MOM: Alex? You okay?
MOM: Alex please respond to me.
MOM: Alex please don't be dead.
I'm glad mom cares enough to say 'don't be dead'. I text her back explaining why I didn't reply and see a new text from Luke.
Luke: Hey wanna come over for dinner? Mum said its cool :-)
Me: Yeah I'll just get ready and drive over
Luke: Okay cool:-) you don't have to be all fancy btw
Me: Okay see ya in a bit
Luke: Cya
I walk to my room and look for the jeans I wore today but can't find them. Just great. I go to my closet and check my drawers and find my ripped jeans in the chin, knees, and mid thigh. That'll do for now. I run downstairs and find my Doc Martins and keys then head outside to my car. Off to Luke's for dinner!
