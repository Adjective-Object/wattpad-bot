"Are you sure this will work?" Scott asked, anxiously.
"Yeah, yeah, just go, Romeo." Chicken shoved him, causing him to bump into the girl of his dreams.
"Oh, hey Jade..." Scott greeted nervously.
"Well howdy, Scott!" Jade smiled to him. "What can I do for ya?"
"Umm..." Scott looked to Lightning and Chicken, nervously.
"Sha-yeah!!" Lightning cheered for him.
"Shut up, loudmouth!" Chicken hissed.
"I was wondering... If... You'd want to have lunch with me?" Scott invited, very nervously.
"Sure, I haven't eaten anythin' since breakfast." Jade smiled, liking the sound of that.
"Great! Umm... Pop's Diner?"
"Sure!"
"There they go," Chicken watched from his hiding spot, surprised that it turned out well. "Come on, Lightnin'!"
"But Lighting hasn't had his DPA, besides, scoopie is waitin' for the Lighting." the over-achieving athlete replied.
Chicken grabbed his arm to go after Jade and Scott. "Now!"
"I'll be back, Scoopie!" Lightning called.
Over at Pop's Diner, Chicken was dressed like a waiter and Lighting was dressed like a fry cook.
"All right, do you remember the plan?" Chicken asked.
"Sha-duh, of course I remember the plan!" Lightning scoffed at him. "Lightning isn't stupid!"
"Sometimes I wonder..." Chicken mumbled under his breath, slightly narrowing his eyes.
"Hey, are you two the waiter and fry cook I've been waiting for months?" Pops asked, totally fooled by their disguises.
"Umm... Yeah!" Chicken lied. "I'm Charlie and this is the fry cook... His name's.... Uhhh..."
"Oh, Scoopie," Lightning sniffed. "I miss ya."
"Scoopie, that's his name!" Chicken said quickly.
"Scoopie?" Pops raised a brow at that unusual name.
"Yeah, his parents were kinda weird..." Chicken shrugged with a nervous smile. "It was his dad's idea."
"Okay, as long as you work, enjoy yourselves, boys," Pops smiled to them. "I'll be off then..." he then walked away with a small laugh. "Scoopie... Funny name..."
"Phew! That was close..." Chicken was in relief. "As long as nuthin' bad happens, I think this'll turn out okay."
"Let's eat here for lunch." a voice said.
"Wait, I know that voice..." Chicken got nervous, he turned around and saw he was right as Mike and her group was coming in to eat their afternoon meal. "Oh, no, I can't let 'em see me like this!" he dashed off into the kitchen. "Hey, we got a problem!"
"Oh, no, Scoopie is gone!" Lightning gasped.
"No, dummy, Mike and her gang are here!" Chicken glared at him.
"Justine is here!" Lightning then got excited. "Oh boy! Hey, Justine, the Lightning is here!"
"Doofus, stay right here!" Chicken, then sighed. "Man, this sucks..."
