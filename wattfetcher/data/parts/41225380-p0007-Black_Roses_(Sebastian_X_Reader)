Ciel's Point Of View
I sat in the carriage and decided to wait.
"Pft. You better not take long." I said.
Coincidentally, a wagon rode towards the carriage. Sebastian drove it, wearing a formal suit and masquerade mask.
I stepped out of the carriage and stared.
"Where the hell were you?"
The demon stepped off of the wagon and chuckled softly. "I was retrieving our maid. It would seem as though Lord Druitt will have to be eradicated again."I sighed. "Back to his old ways?"
"I'm afraid so, master."
(F/N)'s Point Of View
My eyes cracked open to the sound of familiar voices. Odd... I must be half asleep.
"Is she in the back?" Ciel?
"Yes." ....Sebastian?
"Is (F/N) awake?"
"I'm not sure. I can check if you'd like me to, master."
"Go ahead. I'll be in the carriage waiting."
I tensed up in fear. Were they...at the auction? Were they part of the blackmarket?!
I sat up as I heard footsteps. The cloth was removed from the cage entirely. It was Sebastian. My (E/C) eyes widened in horror. I reflectivity scooted away from him. His expression changed completely. Sebastian looked confused.
"My lady, what's wrong?"
"Y-you bought me! Y-you w-were at the auction! You l-let him kidnap me!" My stuttering showed my fear. Dammit.
His expression softened. "I saved you. Someone bought you, but I drove the wagon away before she got there."
"She?" I blurted.
"Hmm, yes. From my understanding, she was planning on using you as... a toy... if you get what I mean." Sebastian replied.
I shuttered at the horrid thought of a woman... using me in such a way.
The dark haired man broke off the lock with a rock that was sitting on the ground.
He extended his hand to me. " Your hand, malady."
I hesitantly took his hand. He gently helped me off of the wagon. Sebastian smirked slightly and gave me a questioning look.
I looked down at the revolting dress I had on and blushed. "I know."
Putting talk of my attire aside, I entered the carriage. Sebastian took responsibility to drive us to the manor.
The sun was setting and it was getting late. I stretched my arms and yawned.
"You can rest. You've had a long day." Ciel voice made me jump.
"Thank you, Earl Phantomhive."
"Pft. You don't have to be so formal. Just call me Ciel."
I nodded and rephrased my sentence. "Thank you, Ciel."
His mouth curled up slightly.
I lied down my side and drifted into sleep.
