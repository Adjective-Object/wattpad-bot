I don't think people understand that a deal doesn't bind me. They keep trying to push me into a corner and hold me there and all it does is freak me out more. I hate it. You can't just keep me here like that. If I'm going to stay I need to find my own reason. Not some half-assed one from an equally suicidal dude in the late hours of the night.
Y'know I don't get that. It seems like all the suicidal kids fall together. Like some magnet. Just a bunch of suicidal kids telling other suicidal kids that suicide isn't the answer. (I'm pretty sure that's a quote somewhere but it seems fitting)Yet it only works for few. It seems we have this mentality, the whole "I may be broken but you're broken too and together we can pull each other out of this". I mean. It works for some people. But I don't see it working for me.
And maybe that's just my inability to accept help because I'll feel weak. I'll feel like I failed myself. Because everyone is living and I'm still stuck on what the best way to go is. So I make my life "do or die* (*even if you do you should probably still die)"It's a shitty way to exist the way I do. Because I shut everyone out even if I don't want to. I drag my life around like a full garbage bag (lately all the dragging is causing my bag to rip).I treat it like trash because it wasn't what I wanted. Sounds pretty bratty, right. But that's me.
My past excuses me to be upset but it does not excuse suicide. In fact suicide is one of the highest sins, selfishly taking the life form the gods gave you. It's cause for suffering in rebirth.
