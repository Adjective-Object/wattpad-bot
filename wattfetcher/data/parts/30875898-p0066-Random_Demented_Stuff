If you ever feel like you want to die, or give up, or stop trying, or anything like that, please read this first, and remember it. If you never remember another thing in your lifetime, please just remember thus one thing.
When you breath out, you breathe out Carbon Dioxide. Carbon Dioxide is what plants use to survive.
Right now, there's a little flower, waiting to bloom. That flower is using your Carbon Dioxide to survive, to get stronger. If you stop breathing, that little flower be as strong anymore, it might even die. That flower is depending on you to help keep it alive, just by breathing.
So if you never do anther thing in life, just keep breathing. Just keep that little flower bud alive. You, you right now are helping nature by giving off Carbon Dioxide. Isn't that pretty cool? You're helping to keep nature alive by being alive.
