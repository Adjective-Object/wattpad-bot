"Shut up both of you!" You shouted at Donna and 10. They were arguing about something stupid, and you had gotten sick of it. "Well only because you asked so nicely." Donna said sarcastically and you rubbed your forehead. 10 looked a bit crestfallen. "Sorry Y/N. I didn't mean to upset you." He said and you shook your head. "I'm going to the beach, see ya two idiots later." as you walked out of the door you heard Donna say "You have a beach in here?" And you never told me!"
Later...
You were suntanning in the beach room in the TARDIS. Don't ask me how there was a BEACH room in the TARDIS. All of a sudden, a shadow went over you, and you looked up. "Doctor! Do the words "Peace and Quiet" mean anything to you?" you shouted as you pulled a towel over you . "Oops... sorry Y/N" But then he grinned. Oh no. "So... Y/N... can you swim?" he asked. before you could answer he had picked you up and was running towards the sea with you in his arms. "Doctor! If you put me in the bloody sea I will bloody kill you!" you shouted, but it was too late. SPLASH! You and 10 landed in the water. You tried to smack him on the arm, but he held you tightly. "Uh, Doctor?" you asked him and he smiled at you. Then he said "Hold your breath." and he dunked the both of you under. "Oi! That was uncalled for!" you yelled, and then you noticed how close your faces were. You don't know how it happened, but somehow you found yourself kissing the doctor. Fireworks exploded, and nothing seemed more magical. Just then from the shore came a whistle and laughing. "I ship it!" Donna called out to you while holding out her phone. Oh no. She had taken a picture. "Come back here!" both of you said as you chased Donna around the TARDIS in your bathing suits. Ya, today was going to be a very interesting day.
