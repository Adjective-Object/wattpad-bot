I was just in the darkness, organizing everything for the game to begin, making sure all monsters were in their proper spawn area, double checking if they had good stats and level for the area, etc. The monster file only took six minutes, 21 seconds and 55 millisecond to go through all of it's data.
If you were wondering, I am a program. An artificial intelligence, or an A.I., and I was made by the creator to keep an eye out for the players stress levels on certain monsters and regular gameplay, to see if I needed to adjust anything.
The game is not perfect, so updates may need to be regular for the first month of gameplay, or at least that's what I predict is going to happen.
I opened the program of Stimulation and started working on it.
The pain percentage was maxed... I started to type in codes to lower it down to, let's say, 65%.
I looked at the rest of the file and made a few adjustments. I pushed the enter button and watched through my monitor as the whole world adjusted. Turning into nothing but codes and then forming again. I rebooted the whole thing and watched the spawn area.
I sat and waited. Then the first player logged on.
-----------Yeah, this is short. I know, but I'm working on the first chapter right away! So hold on!
