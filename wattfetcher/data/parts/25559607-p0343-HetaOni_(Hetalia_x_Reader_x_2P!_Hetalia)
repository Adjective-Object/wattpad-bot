I looked down in silence.




Luciano walked up to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. "That's why we decided to take you back home. That's the reason why we were even desperate enough to want to talk to the First Players about it."



The Italian lifted my chin and made me face him. "So that's why you're going to come with us and we'll get you out of here—"





The realisations were making me snap slowly.




"No." I said in a low voice, pushing Luciano away from me.



He gave me a confused look and tried moving closer towards me once more, but I raised a hand, signalling him to stop. "No. No, don't come near me. This isn't happening. This isn't true. None of this is." I told him in a monotone voice.



They looked at each other, as if trying to ask what was going on.



Luciano still persisted moving closer to me, as he spoke, "Ragazza, please. It's the truth. I—"



"No!! How many times do I have to say that?!" I snapped at him.



He looked at me with tired eyes, "....and how many times do I have to answer that painful question?"



Why?




Why is he acting like he cares?



Why does that lifeless body on the floor look like me?
