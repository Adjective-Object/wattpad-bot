I rolled my eyes at him, "Fine."
"Actually Kellin you can't stay in bed." Jaime said smugly, "We got a bunch of new merch in and you have to sort through it all."
He groaned into his pillow, "I'll be up soon."
"Get up now oh and Vic Johnny said you guys are singing Starving for Friends together so you can have fun with that." Mike said happily as they all walked off and I let out a loud groan.
"What's wrong with singing Starving for Friends?" Kellin asked curiously and I scowled, "I love that song."
"Well first if you haven't noticed Johnny Craig is like the biggest dick on tour and second he keeps trying to get in my pants." I grumbled getting out of the bed, "Now come on. I have soundcheck and you have work." I told him helping the boy up.
Kellin scowled, "I know he's a jerk you should see how treats the merch staff and as for getting in your pants that is not allowed. I am the only one who can do that and at the moment I'm not even allowed to." Kellin complained and I held back a smile.
"Well don't worry you have no competition. As soon as I am ready for a relationship you'll be the first one I tell." I told him and he smiled at me.
"I better be or else we are going to have some problems Victor Fuentes."
"Don't worry Quinn."
"I won't." He said. "I'll be off. See you later Vic."
"Bye Kells." I said just as he headed out of the bus.
"You guys are gonna be together by next week or earlier." Tony said hopping down from his bunk.
I scoffed, "No we're not."
"Yeah you are. I just know it."
"Whatever you say." I said rolling my eyes, "Now let's go to soundcheck."
"Okay let's go."
We got to the venue quickly only for Johnny to grab my arm and stop me as soon as I walked in the building.
"God, what do you want?" I groaned pulling my arm away from him.
"I just wanted to know if you have been thinking about my offer or not." He said smiling at me.
"I've already told you once no Johnny I'm not interested."
"Oh come in, it'll be fun."
"No Johnny I'm not interested." I said glaring at him.
"Just one time."
"I said no and that means no so back off. I don't like you."
He pressed himself up against me and smiled, "Remember how much fun we had last time." He said in what I guess is supposed to be a seductive voice.
I pushed him off me, "Get away and stay away."
"Come on Vic. Just one last time."
"No."  I said and walked away from him.
"Hey what'd Johnny want?" Jaime asked as soon as I got to the stage.
"He wants to hook up again." I said rolling my eyes, "In hindsight we should have never asked Slaves to join us on tour just for this reason."
"Oh gross."
"I know, anyways let's just do our soundcheck and then I have to practice my song with the ass." I told them.
