I heard bells all around me go off. My brain started shouting "There's a fire! Get out!" but my body refused to move. I stared at the bell, and watch it sing its violent tune. This bell could mean two things.
One; that there is a fire.
Two; that there was a dangerous stranger in the building.
I didn't know which warning it was giving me, so I decided to find out, before I was found by a teaching and yelled at for not attending the drill.
My feet carried me outside of the bathroom, dragging on the tiled floor. My heart pounded, and my mind was racing with questions.
Will I get caught in the hallway?
Is this really a drill?
Is there anyone else in the hallway with?
The last question I asked myself when I heard a curse word come from the boy's bathroom. I turned around quickly, and caught sight of the third grader that had just walked out of the bathroom.
"Hey," he mumbled. I cracked a smile.
"Hi," I returned," do you have any idea what's going on?"
