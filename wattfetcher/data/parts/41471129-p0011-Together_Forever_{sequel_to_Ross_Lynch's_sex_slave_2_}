While I was on the bed, I looked at the time and noticed that it was now 1o o clock, but Ross isn't back as yet. My phone started to ring and when I looked at the caller ID I saw Jordyn's name, so i answered it
//////PHONE CONVO//////
Ariana - Hey Jordyn
Jordyn - Hi mom
Ariana - What's up?
Jordyn - Nothing much, I just wanted to call you
Ariana - Ok then, how's dance camp?
Jordyn - Awesome, I made so much friends here and I even experienced being sprayed by a skunk
Ariana - Oh god...how'd that happen?
Jordyn - Well...one of the coaches took us out for a walk and...long story short, a girl named Alissa mistook the skunk for a cat, she brought it over to all of us and....we got sprayed
Ariana - Well are you ok now?
Jordyn - Yeah
Ariana - How's Maddy
Jordyn - Oh Maddie, I haven't seen her since....last week maybe?. She's been avoiding me, she got a new boyfriend and new friends so....apparently she doesn't need me
Ariana - Sweetie I'm sure she's not avoiding you.....maybe she just...wants to hang out with new people
Jordyn - Eh, for all I care she could suck a cows cock
Ariana - Jordyn, language
Jordyn - I'm sorry, I gotta go mom.Huge party tonight, I can't miss it
Ariana - K, bye, have fun and absolutely no drinking
Jordyn - No promises
Ariana - Just try not to get drunk, your 12 years old  for crying out loud
Jordyn - Ok fine, bye
Ariana - Bye
/////END OF PHONE CONVO//////
A few minutes later I got bored and decided to read a magazine. Soon after that, the door opened and Ross walked in.
Ross - Hey
Ariana - Um...hi
Ross - Look, Ariana, I'm sorry. Ok?. I was being stupid and I'm just really sorry
Ariana - Its ok
Ross - Forgive me?
Ariana - Dont  I always?
Its only a matter of time before he makes another mistake and then I'll be on the verge of leaving, he'll find a reason to make me stay, I forgive him and the cycle goes on.....and on .
