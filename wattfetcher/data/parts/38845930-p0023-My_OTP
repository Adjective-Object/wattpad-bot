Erin's POV
Jordan took my hand and kissed my head before moving making me clench his hand as hard as my weak half sleeping body could.
"I'm staying here." He said.
Very glad that he was, I cuddled up next to him and kissed his shoulder.
"So cute." He complained.
"What, me?" I asked.
"Yeah, duh." He said
I laughed evily and looked in his adorable eyes. He gave me a look of confusion and put his hand on my hip.
"What?" I asked.
He chuckled and made a really happy looking face.
"What, Jordan?" I asked again.
He laughed and pressed his face into my pillow. I turned away from him to get more comfortable and he scooted closer and wrapped his arm around my waist.
He held me as close to him as he could and kissed the back of my neck repeatedly.
"Jordan." I chuckled.
"I love you." He said.
"Mmm, I love you." I responded.
"Hmm, yeah." He yawned.
--how many of you yawned when you read this?--
I grabbed his hands and he kissed my ear.
"Jordan." I said quietly.
"Yeah, baby?" He asked.
"Nothing, I just... I just say your name sometimes." I said.
"Would you mind toning down your cuteness? Just for now so I don't die." He asked.
"I don't know how to do that so... you're just gonna die I guess." I said with a mumble.
"Jesus, that was even cuter." He said.
"How?" I asked.
"Stop! Have I not told you before?" He said.
"What am I doing!?" I asked.
"Living!" He screamed before rolling over, practically on top of me and kissing me.
