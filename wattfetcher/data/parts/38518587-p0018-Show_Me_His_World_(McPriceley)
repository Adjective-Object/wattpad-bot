Connor picked up the thong and looked at it. "Yeah, I kinda got that."
"That's not mine."
"I should hope so."
Connor tossed the thong to Kevin, who caught it shakily and then dropped it into a trash can.
"Um, sorry." Kevin could feel nervous sweat dripping down the back of his neck.
"Don't worry about it. To be honest, it wasn't that surprising to find a lonely thong in your workplace. I figured it was only a matter of time before I stumbled upon that playboy lifestyle of yours." Connor said with a casual smile.
Kevin sighed in relief.
"Kevin, on Friday my show starts previews and we're having a party after the first one. It's a plus-one invitation and I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but we had complications. Do you want to come? It'll be cool, there's gonna be cocktails and dinner and press. The Broadway execs even said I could invite Naba, Thomas, Arnold, and James because of the article."
Kevin considered Connor's invitation, then got an idea of his own. "Sure I'll go with you, it won't be a party unless I'm there anyway."
Connor rolled his eyes but smiled brightly at Kevin. For a moment, Kevin forgot what he was going to say next, the words we lost in Connor's smile, but he quickly regained his cool.
"Tomorrow I have a fashion show, do you want to come?"
"Really?"
"Yeah, I mean, you invited me to your thing so it's the least it could do." Kevin rambled.
Connor hushed him. "I'd love to go, Kevin."
"I feel obligated to mention that this is a fashion show for dogs." Kevin added.
"Well tomorrow just got twelve times cooler!" Connor exclaimed, jumping off the conference table. "Let's go, my dear shadow. Broadway awaits!"
