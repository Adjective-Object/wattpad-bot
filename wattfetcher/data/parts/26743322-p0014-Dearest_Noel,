dearest noel,
noel, today i realized something. we waste so much time noel. we let the simple and little things of life pass us right by while we're busy trying to dictate and plan our future.
we don't live in the present.
we don't notice how the brilliant green leaves dance in the air, or how the ocean softly kisses the shore, how that girls' eyes lights up when she sees the onee guy who makes butterflies explode in her tummy, how the golden sun spreads across the sky enveloped by tiny specks of crimson red.
we let all the beautiful things pass by because we're so worried about the outcome of the future. circled with fear of failure or rejection.
we conceal our love, our emotions, all because of the fear of being rejected.
i did that noel. i let fear of the future's outcome stop me from living in the present. and i will always and forever regret it.
that i let the chance go by without telling the truth to you, my dearest noel.
i'd rather getting rejected a thousand times by the person i was in love with rather than never getting the chance to.
but i guess i can't do either of that noel.
why?
because that person is gone, noel.
you're gone.
