It's already 8 PM when I arrived at Moone Dessert Restaurant. As expected, there was no one there except for the crew. I decided to go in anyway. "I deserve a treat for surviving a day like this."
The shop is filled with cake – lots of cake. The aroma lures you into this hypnotic state where all you want is to eat everything that is displayed. The ambiance is perfect for someone having a bad day and looking for a place to relax. It's perfect for me!
"Excuse me. Can I please order two slices of "French Kiss" cake?"
A lady at her forties greeted me with a warm smile and replied, "Is that all handsome sir?"
"Yes, yes ma'am. And yeah, thanks for the compliment!" I blushed.
"That would be 300 Baht." I handed her the payment. "Please take this number. The cake will be served at your table. Thanks!"
"Alright!"
The lady smiled again and called one of her waiters. "Art, please serve the young sir two slices of cake."
The name sounded familiar. But then again, anyone can have "Art" as a name. I smiled.
==========================================================
"Chase?"
I turned around to see a familiar person wearing the shop's uniform. "Ooh! The photo guy!"
"Yeah, the photo guy." He grinned widely. "If I had known you were the one ordering, I could've given this to you for free!"
"Art, I didn't know you worked here," I'm still smiling.
"Oh, I don't come here often. I only helped my mom today because the shop is lacking numbers. Some of her employees fell sick and can't work now."
"Ah! That's very kind of you."
"Here's your order – two slices of our best-selling French Kiss cake."
"Thanks Art! This looks yummy!"
"Of course! My mom made it," he bragged. "Wait for me, I'll change clothes."
"Uhmm... Okay."
==========================================================
"So... What brought you here today?" Art asked.
"Well, this girl told me she'd wait for me here but I guess she got tired and went home."
"Aaaahh. A date? And you made a girl wait? Tsk tsk."
"Yeah." I went sad.
"I'm just kidding. Oi, don't take it too seriously. You'll ruin your cute face!"
"..." I looked at him. He looks really happy. I started to feel my cheeks go hotter.
He looked at his cake and shyly uttered, "I'm kinda' happy this happened though."
I don't know how to react but I still managed to say, "Yeah."
He looked at me again with a bigger smile on his face and said, "Thanks for coming."
"O-of c-course." I looked away from him. What is wrong with me?
"Hey Chase, cheer up! Stop worrying about things. Just go with the flow. If you think about things too much, you'll find yourself suffocating and drowning. Take a breather every once in a while. It won't kill you if you decided to relax you know?"
"O-okay."
