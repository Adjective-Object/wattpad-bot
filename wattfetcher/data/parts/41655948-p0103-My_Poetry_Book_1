Take me to the edge of tonight Because you make me happy. And I'm your unintended, remember? I've got people falling asleep to me reading them my poetry But you never cease to amaze me. You are everything I am so glad I have. I am living in secrecy, I am a shadow in the night, But you bring out all my light. I feel you in the lyrics I sing, And in the rush I get when I write poetry Without getting any sleep last night. You make me feel the way I do when the darkness Seems perpetual, Like the reality of dawn is never to come. - (m.m)
