"What did you two do after breakfast? Seeing as you left a nice mark on my best friends neck." Kellin asked.
"Oh don't worry about it." I said smirking.
"Mhm sure."
"Besides it's none of your business anyways."  I told him.
"Alan will tell me about it don't worry."
"What am I telling you?" Alan asked walking back out and handing Vic a thick envelope.
"Why you have such a big hickey on your body." He said crossing his arms.
He blushed, "It's on my neck Kells and it's none of your concern."
"As your best friend I would think it is." He sniffed.
"You don't need to know."
"Well then I see how it is. Austin keep your dick to yourself." He said looking at me.
"What did I do!?" I asked.
"Don't think I don't know."
"We didn't do anything that you think."
"Uh huh," He said not sounding convinced. "Sure, Vic let's go so these two can have some alone time."
"We already had plenty of that." Alan said, "and the guys are here so..."
"Kells, I think we can stay and hang out for a little bit." Vic said.
"You guys can, I don't mind." I said sitting down and pulling Alan with me.
"Alright sounds good with me." Vic said and sat down.
"Oh yeah Vic I made enough copies for you and the guys to all get one picture."
"Awesome, I'll give the idiots their copies later." He said as Kellin sat on his lap.
"Okay, I hope you like them."
"I bet they're great." He said as Kellin to the pictures from Vic and started to look through them.
"These are really good Al." He said flipping through.
"Oh thanks." Alan said blushing a little.
"No problem." He said and stopped on one giggling a little. "I think this one is my favorite."
"Which one is it?" I asked.
"Mike sneezing."
"Oh nice." I said, "Why did you take a picture of Mike sneezing?"
"I didn't mean to , I went to take another one but  I caught this instead..." Alan said, "And it's funny."
"Yeah it is, and it's getting framed and I'm hanging it up in the front of the bus." Vic said looking at the picture laughing.
"Yeah I had a few people buy that one."
"Really?"
"Yeah I make money off this shit because your fans want photos. I sold like ten of those."
"Well I know fans like picture I'm just surprised they would want one of Mike sneezing."
"You'd be surprised at what they've got of you guys."
"What do you mean?"
"I've sold some weird ones."
"Well that's not frightening at all." I said sarcastically.
"Its not bad, well not all of them..."
"I'm scared to even ask about the weird ones."
