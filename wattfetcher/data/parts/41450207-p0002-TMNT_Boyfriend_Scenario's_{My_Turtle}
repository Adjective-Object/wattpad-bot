Raphael

You were pissed, The purple dragons destroyed your uncle's restaurant once again and this time they were gonna pay big time, cause no one messed with your family no one.

"Fong!" You yelled angrily

Fong turned around only to get punched in the nose

"Stay away from my uncle and his restaurant!" You growled

"If we don't~" he teased

You punched him again and threw him into the wall and knocked him out cold and his friends too.

"ya know ya could of at least saved one fo' me" A voice spoke

"Sorry" You unintentionally apologized

Then you looked up and saw a turtle, A muscular looking turtle with a Red mask and Sharp, bright Green eyes and two sais on his belt, You stared at him in astonishment and he smirked glad you weren't scared of him.

"Raphael, But call me Raph" Raph introduced himself

"I'm Y/n" You introduced

"cool see ya later, gotta go before Leo freaks" Raph spoke

Then he was gone in a blink of an eye

Donatello

You were laying on your rooftop star glazing, when you heard a thud on your rooftop next to you, you quickly sat up and saw a turtle standing their. A tall turtle with a Purple mask and amazing brownish red eyes and a bo staffed strapped to his shell, you both stared at each other then you randomly said the first thing that popped into your mind.

"are you a ninja?" you asked

"uh.. yes" He hesitatingly replied

"cool" You spoke

"Cool!? WHAT!? No screaming!? no running away!?" He spoke shocked

"Nope, by the way i'm Y/n" You introduced

"Donatello but I prefer Donnie or Don" Donnie introduced

Donnie stared at you like you were crazy

"what?" you asked

"your not scared or me? I'm a freaking turtle for crying out loud!" Donnie spoke
