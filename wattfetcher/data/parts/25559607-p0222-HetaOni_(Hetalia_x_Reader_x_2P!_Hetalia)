France edged a little closer to observe the situation. "Looking closely, it looks like America is fighting it for the first time. Which means he should be the strongest... Will we have to count on him?"

"Yeah, we're worn-out, and even America will have to see what's going on and take over, saying something like, 'Leave it to the hero!'.." Prussia told him.

France nodded. "All right, then let's slowly pass behind the monster and hide."

Prussia and France slowly crept behind the monster quietly, so as to not alarm the creature of their presence.

Unfortunately, America noticed them from afar and muttered, "That's--"

Prussia pressed a finger to his lips and whispered, "America, you handle this!We're going to recover for a while..."

America didn't seem to read the situation and instead rushed over towards Prussia and France and exclaimed, "Hey!! Over here! What the hell? You guys sure are slow!"


"Stay away from me, you idiot! How can you be so stupid?!" France scolded.

America tilted his head, "What?"

Just then, the grey monster turned around to face them, getting ready to attack.


Prussia noticed this and he suddenly panicked. "R---RUN!!!" he shouted at them as the three of them ran away.

Japan nodded at the previous explanation. "I see. And then you three left Russia and Canada behind and ran to the basement."

"When I came to, I was surprised to see that America was nowhere to be found, and CanadaÂ had disappeared, too.

"S-so, America is alive... right?" Canada asked in a worried tone.

Canada's eyes widened. "What?! B-But I was there all along!"

Russia nodded, adjusting his bloodied scarf. "Yeah, definitely. If he weren't, even you would be troubled, wouldn't you?"

Russia chuckled. "Oh, really? Sorry~ So, what were you and the others doing in the meantime, Japan?" he asked, turning to the Japanese man.
