I finally went out today.
To the park.
The park where we used to go.
I was watching some kids swing back and forth on the swings.
What a creep I am.
I wouldn't move my butt from that cold metal bench though.
I just sat there.
We used to do that just there.
Swing on the swings.
Your hair trailing behind you like a comets tail.
A dark black comet tail.
You would laugh your cheeks turning bright red.
I didn't notice when a little girl approached me.
"Sir will you push me on the swing."she said.
I was staring off thinking about you.
She tugged on my sleeve.
"Sure."I said abruptly.
She smiled a gap between her teeth.
Bright dots in her cheeks.
She was innocent being young.
I'd hate for her to go through hell.
To get her heart broken.
Hopefully she never grows up.
I sighed and got up to push her on the swing.
She giggled as her feet went straight up in the air.
Her black hair trailing behind her.
Like a comets tail.
I sighed again.
Even now I was thinking about her.
Damn I am a pure idiot.
I stopped pushing her as memories flashed in my brain.
"I love you." she said as she jumped off the swing
I smiled and pulled her to me "I love you too."
The little girl came to stand next to me while I cried.
"What's wrong sir?"she said tugging on my sleeve.
I'd give her a simple answer.
But what I was going to say was anything but simple.
It was freaking complex as fuck.
"Life."I whispered.
Fuck life.
Fuck love.
Fuck it all.
It was a damn lie.
