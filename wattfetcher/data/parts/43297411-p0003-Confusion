"B-But you already did." He whimpered.
I frowned. I hated seeing the one I loved so upset.
"How did I hurt you?" I asked him.
He sighed. "I love you, Riley, and it hurts to see that you love Jake."
My eyebrows shot straight up.
"Me? Love Jake? Yah, Patrick. I do love Jake, as a brother. Your the only one I truly love." I leaned down and kissed him. Not the greeting kind of kiss.
"Let me go check on Jake and yell at him, ok? I love you. Be careful." I told him and walked out.
When I walked over to Jake, I put my hand on my hips.
"Jake! He is lying on my couch bleeding out! How could you, you know he would never hurt me, and that I love him! Why, Jake! He almost had to go to the hospital!" I screamed.
"Riley, listen, I'm sorry. But you know as well as I do that he could potentially hurt you!" Jake yelled.
"Listen, Jake, is it that your worried about me or that your jealous of him?" I asked.
"Ha! Me? Jake Ryan? Jealous? Of HIM? No of course not!" He shrieked.
"Jake, look I know your lying..." I stated.
"Fine, I am jealous. But not of the fact that you have a crush on him, I'm jealous of the fact that I can't make you happy like he can! You love me like a brother, and I love you like a sister, but all I want is to make you happy!" He told me.
"Jake, you do make me happy. Thanks to you, I have someone to call when I'm feeling down. I have a shoulder to cry on when I get sad. You make me so happy, Jake. Your family." I responded.
"Thanks, Ry. And I'm sorry I hurt Patrick." He hugged me.
"Oh shit! Patrick!" I ran out of the room.
I went to grab a towel cloth, but I heard a loud thump!
"PATRICK? ARE YOU OK?" I screamed.
No response.
"Ugh!" I groaned.
I rushed out to get the cloth on his head.
I gasped.
"JAKE! HELP!"
There, Patrick was lying unconscious, in a pool of blood.
