My name is Luna and I am a neko I also uave a brother Pluto but ive never been able to find him for years while, I have no memory of my human parents but, I do know that I have a wonderful cat family already that treat me well,feed me and, care for me ive lived with them for longer than I can remember.
But that all changes when I meet a man who's name happens to be Sebastian.
