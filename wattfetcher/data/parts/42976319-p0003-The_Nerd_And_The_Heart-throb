(After school)
"So I was thinking, you should come over some time, my parents would be glad to finally see that I made friends!" Emily giggled.
"Yeah! I'm sure my mom would want to meet you too! I haven't had a friend around in ages." I laughed, linking arms with her.
"Aw look guys, the nerd finally has a friend. Isn't that just cute?" Chloe mocked, approaching us slowly.
"Hey Emily, you might want to run." I advised, slowly letting go of her.
"No." She stated firmly, tightening her grip on me.
"Alright, come here, and I won't hurt you." Chloe smiled, signalling for her to go to her.
"You know what, Chloe?" Emily smirked.
"What?"
"You can go fuck yourself, bitch." She spat, glaring at her.
"Your friend needs to stand up for you? That's pathetic." Emma, one of my close friends who left me, commented.
"That's what friends do." I snapped, glaring at her.
"You weren't my friend." She growled, glaring back.
Ouch.
I could tell Emily was getting pissed off, but before she could open her mouth and speak, I dragged her to the car park.
"What the hell? I'm not done with those bitches! Let me go!" She struggled, yelling.
"Calm down, we'll finish this tomorrow, I've had enough of Chloe today." I laughed, unlocking my car, and pushing Emily inside.
"Fine. But when we see them tomorrow, you better let me finish it." She huffed, leaning against the seat.
I nodded, laughing softly.
I needed to stand up for myself more.
And that's exactly what I'm going to do.
