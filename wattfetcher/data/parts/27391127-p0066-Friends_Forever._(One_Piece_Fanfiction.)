"Welcome to Paradise, my mellorine love~<3"
"Thank you, Sanji-kun." Sakura thanked awkwardly some pink dusting her cheeks. Sanji went into over drive and passed out.
"Hm. Serves that Ero-cook right." Zoro mumbled.
"Heard that."

"Well, I guess its my turn." Chopper stated. He looked around looking for someone to dare or even ask a question then he landed on Law.
"Law, do you like reindeers?"
"Originally, I wouldn't give a damn about reindeers but you are a very interesting one, Tony-ya." Law answered.
"Yohohohoho. It my turn. Nami truth or dare."
"Dare."
"Can I see your panties? Yohohohohohohoho!" Brook asked politely before bursting into laughter. Sanji somehow woke up from his 'transcended state' and hearts became his eyes!
"Is this the day I finally get to see Nami-san's panties!" Sani exclaimed, twirling around, forgetting that he was handcuffed to someone.
"Oi, Sanji!"
Nami then sighed, "Guess I have no choice." She un-did the buttons of her jeans and pulled down her jeans for a spilt second before pulling them back up. It could be said that day, Sanji was near death had it not been to Sakura being chained to him.
"Al those who saw must pay a fine of 600,000.00 belli" Nami stated ruthlessly.
"Continuing." Law said half-willingly. Dares went on for the rest of the night. Chopper had to eat meat for once in his life, Luffy had to not eat for ten minutes and Robin had to drink a barrel of sake.

"Sakura, I dare you to let Sanji kiss your cheek!" Aya exclaimed. You could literally see the colour flow out of Sakura.
"Don't worry Sakura-dear! I'll be gentle!" Sanji exclaimed but Sakura merely rocked herself before face plating into the floor.
"You should be happy. It took Robin 5 minutes to drink that barrel."
"Yeah but now's she's passed out on her bed because of you." Nami mentioned.
After a few seconds, Sakura collected herself and awaited the terrible experience.

(Sorry all you Sanji-fans out there. I like him but I can only tolerate so much.)

Sanji leaned in closer but Sakura leaned away until finally she had the brilliant idea to hold Zoro's leg and...

(See picture)

*Smooch*

To the whole world, what was seen was Sanji kissing Zoro and Sakura was holding their two shirts together before rapidly letting them go.
"That was close."
"Saki-ya, how evil can you get?"
"As evil, as I need to be for the occasion." Sakura smiled. Sanji almost died in an emo corner and Zoro went into the bathroom , according to him, to wash the 'ero-germs' off him.
"Yosh! Let's get back to the game!"
