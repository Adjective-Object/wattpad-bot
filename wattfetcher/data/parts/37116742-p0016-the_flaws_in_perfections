I wish I had the trust and patience To have somebody.
I wish I mattered.
I wish there was an ounce of worth and significance to me.
I wish my peers acknowledged me.
I wish I was good at the things I love.
I wish the people I live with cared.
I wish I was important.
I wish the people that said they cared were being truthful.
I wish someone saw good in me.
I wish I wasn't such a fuck up.
