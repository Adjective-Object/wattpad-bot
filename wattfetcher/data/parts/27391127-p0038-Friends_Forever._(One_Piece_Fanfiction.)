"Sakura, are you okay?" Haruka asked rushing into the bathroom. Sakura turned around in complete shock.

"How much did you hear?"
"Everything."
"You stalker!"
"What the fucking hell?"

"SHUT UP! I COULD HEAR YOU DOWN THE HALLWAY, YOU ALBINO ASS!" Aya screamed, punching Haruka.

"Wait..did you just curse?" Sakura asked.
"That was definitely a curse." Haruka agreed, rubbing his sore head.

"For  your information, that word mean donkey in the dictionary and albino  means white so technically I called him a white donkey."

"You're too smart for your own good." Sakura sighed.
"Agreed." Haruka and Twilight answered in unison.

"Wow, there's so many people!" Aya awed looking at the people streaming the cathedral.

"Yeah, there's even royalty from Alabasta, Fishman Island and Dressrosa."
"Wait..Dressrosa?"

"Yeah, the King of Dressrosa, Kin-" Twilight started before Aya placed her hand over her mouth.

"Don't say that name..wait did you say that the Neptune family from Fishman Island is here?"

"Yeah, they were the first to arrive." Twilight explained. She looked behind her and saw Haruka walking up to them.

"Sorry Haruka-senpai but he'll be there."
"That's okay. I'll just stay where he can't see me." Haruka answered looking as calm as ever.

Twilight continued watching the people stream for a while before. "I don't wanna Queen anymore."

"We've been over this fucking shit before!" Haruka shouted.
"Language." Aya answered, slapping him.

"Guys,  there are so many people down there. It's amazing." Sakura exclaimed  running up to them. She nearly tripped on herself before continuing.

"You should've fall." Haruka heartlessly stated.
"Shut up!" Sakura answered.

"Sakura-chan, are you okay?" Twilight asked.
