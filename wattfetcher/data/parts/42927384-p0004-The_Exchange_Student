I guess when we pulled up in a limousine it attracted quite a few neighbors. Shouldn't they have been sleeping? It's like 3:00 a.m. here and a handful or neighbors are still up. One house that's on the corner of the opposite street I stay on has all of the lights on up in there. Must be night owls. I just shrug it off and walk down past that house making my way to the creek. I know its late at night but my mother doesn't care. I can't sleep either so why not explore the place? Wait. I just heard a door open then close. It's probably someone entering their home, maybe went out to a party...
The creek is a beautiful place. The water is so calming and the scenery is breathtaking. A crystal water stream with trees in the background, and the full moon hovering above us. I can get used to this.
*Snap*
I turn my head around instantly. I'm full of fear now. Until I see a stunning auburn head beauty. I look into her eyes and the moon gives full affect of her hazel eyes, and shows her angelic facial features. She speakers, "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I come here every night. I haven't seen you around. Are you new here?" I love the sound of her voice. She sounds like an angel. (Clich√© I know, but that's the only way to describe her voice)."I-I um yeah I just moved inn a few hours ago actually." My Russian accent is clearly dominant. She looks at me with these dreaming looking eyes. My heart rate just accelerated 10 times faster than usually, and I'm already stuttering to someone who's actually quite angelic. Is this what love at first sight is? Cause this new feeling is too strong. Ugh, what's happening to me?!
