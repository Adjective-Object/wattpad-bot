"Deal, it was nice to work with you, I'll be there in 10 minutes, take care of Elina" He hung up.
.......
And here he comes -the muscular jerk- to save the day.
Damon pushed the door with his leg furiously, "How dare you come here and break into the place like this ?" A cop said, "Hey, I'm Damon Carter and I would really like to know why are my sister and cousin are behind the bars for driving my car ?" He put his hand in his pocket and used the free one to comb his hair with his hand in a sexy way.
"Let me check the papers please" The one with the broken nose flipped the papers of the car and read them carefully, "Hurry up because we will sue you if those two young innocent ladies stay right there", "Alright Damon, the papers are clean and original, we'll let go of both of them immediately after you sign few papers" The mustachey one passed some papers to damon, "Listen to me, you better get those two out right now before this thing gets to the ministor's ears himself, you know who the Carters are" Damon ripped the papers apart. I was surprised how he could do all of this confidently without being afraid, seems like the Carters are really important here.
We walked out in slow-motion with our heads high and dignity back while the three cops were eying us carefully and probably cursing us in under their breathe.
"Any reasonable explanation ?" Damom turned the car on, "Not now, we're tired" Elina jumped in the front seat while I got in the back, "We should go home quickly because I have many math homeworks to do" Damon eyed me in the mirror, "No, we are not going back until we complete what we started. I took this car to go to an orphanage because I want to give away some clothes and food and we are NOT going back before every piece of the clothes beside me gets in the hands of an orphan girl, get it ?", "But it's too late we should go back home, I promise I'll take you to an orphanage tomorrow, mom is going crazy", "No Damon, If you want to go back I'm not going to tie you and force you into this, just leave the car", "You're stubborn *pause* and that's what I like about you the most", "Just drive" ....
After 10 minutes of complete silence ...
"TWO OF MY CHOCOLATES ARE MISSING" Damon shouted, me and Elina laughed out loud, "Ooopps" I chuckled, "You two are so dead when we get back home" We had few moments of silence before ... "You do realize that the orphan has girls younger than 18 right ?" Damon asked, "Of course I do" I rolled my eyes, "And you do realize that your only fits girls between 15-17 years old right? What about the other little girls ?" I didn't realize this, "So what should I do, I cannot give some girls and ignore the others" I should've thought about this, "Wait right here" Damon stopped the car and got out, "Where did he go" I asked Elina but I figured out the answer when I saw the huge toys store, "What is he doing in there ?", "Damon is way more sweet than he looks" Elina answered, "And what is that supposed to mean ?", "You'll see" We waited for 30 minutes before he became visible, "Come on what were you doing it's getting really late, it's almost midnight a- What is that ?" I stared at the huge plastic bags he was holding, Damon ignored my question and opened the door I was leaning on then threw the plastic bags on and around me, "We wont meet the little girls empty-handed", "See what I meant ?" Elina smiled at me and I smiled at the idea of Damon being nice and thibkong about others, Allah only knows how much these toys coasted him.
