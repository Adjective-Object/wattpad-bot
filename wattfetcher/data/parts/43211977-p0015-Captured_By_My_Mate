As we leave Jake he wanted to drive I said "Don't use stereotypical statements on how men are better than women on me!" I continue "and further more I'm not coming in the puppy house! I'm going to my home" h replies "Good I'll tag along" I reply " you have a pack to take care of and further more I'm breaking up with you so get out my damn fucking car"
It turned bad when I said that for he now pinned me to the wall and told me "you are fucking mine! We are mates!You can't fucking leave me!" I replied "I don't feel sorry for you and pretty mush lately your being a asshole!" I leave
And go home
