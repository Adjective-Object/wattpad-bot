PART TWO: RESISTANCE
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
"Yes. I will join your resistance group." The words felt foreign on Jade's tongue; she never would've thought in a million years that she'd say that in complete seriousness. In fact, once she had full understanding of the words that had left her mouth, she widened her own eyes in surprise. Quickly setting her gaze back to one of determination, she remembered why she had said those words in the first place. I need to do this on my own terms, not because some silly promise is making me. It's time for change. I'm ready for whatever the world has to throw at me.
The man standing across from her filled with a complete childlike giddiness, none other than the leader of the group himself. Ayden Tate. He bounced up and down a few times before lunging at Jade, engulfing her in a tight hug. She was taken aback, and stumbled backwards. Ayden still had his arms around her though, keeping her from falling. After a few long seconds of the embrace, Jade returned the hug, and when she did, Ayden leaned down closer to her ear to release a whisper. "This means more to me than you may think. Thank you."
Jade looked at his sharp jawline, focusing on just that one part of his face. "I'm going to do what I want to do from now on. I want to do this. It was nothing."
"No, it's something. It's a very big something. And you're going to be a very big part of it. Are you absolutely one hundred percent positively sure that you want to do this?"
"I said I was, no need to start trying to change my mind already."
Ayden broke the hug, backing up and leaning against the building again. "I have to ask you to do something you may not want to do. Like, really not want to do."
Jade shrugged her shoulders. "It can't be too bad. Whatever it is, it should be a breeze. Considering all I've been through in the past year."
The redhead stared at the pebbly ground lining the cramped semi-alley. "Where is Ian right now?" Oh...right. He still exists. I guess I didn't think this through enough. When Jade remained silent, Ayden sighed. He left his wall and gently gripped her arm. "You can't keep leaving him alone like this. He's going to snap not knowing what's going on with you."
"I know. He could either get extremely depressed, or dangerously violent. And in the worst case, both." Jade turned to face the wall behind her and bit her lip. This is really bad.
"We'll end up back in Ireland at some point. And you most likely won't be able to come back until the war is over. Who knows how long that'll last?" Ayden sighed behind her. "I recommend you, um, maybe...end things with him."
"I've been thinking of doing that even before I accepted to join. It's just too much to deal with right now." Jade pressed her palms against her temples, stress clear on her face. "I guess I should do that now then?"
Ayden's facial expression remained thoughtful as he pondered this. Finally, he shook his head. "Not right now. Do it when you're at home. You can pack a small bag, but you need to leave as soon as you can. I'll be waiting for you. Wait, first I need your address." He scratched the back of his head and grinned nervously. "That sounds like a stalker statement." Jade remained emotionless as she pulled out a small slip of paper and a pen, jotting down the title of her residence. Once she finished, she tossed the pen against the building behind her, receiving a light clack. She handed Ayden the note, and he gave it a once-over before shoving it deep into his pocket. "Very well then. Uh, better go to him then."
