I ran a comb through my hair, making sure to make it smooth and wavy. To hide the colors a bit, I tied it up in a loose bun. Now only the red at the roots and the blond at the tips could be seen well, the rest was hidden in shadow.
I glanced at my reflection further and averted my eyes to my counter. Sitting on it was a black make-up bag, one of the things left from my mother.
I hadn't touched it ever, even before her death, another way of showing my respect for her I guess.
I hesitantly reached out and grabbed the bag, opening it to reveal small compartments separating the make-up.
I opened the one I suspected contained the eye shadow. Yup. I pulled the small brush out and dusted my eyelids slightly silver, mixing and darkening it with a light blue. I added a swirl flaring out from the sides at the corner of my eyes. I shaped the swirl into a small flower and smiled at my reflection. There's another thing that'll set me apart from the rest of them. I put more detail on the flower and added leaves around the base that connected the small design to my eye, which was the most likely candidate for the stem.
I did the same for the other side and closed the eye shadow, putting it back where it went.

üåºTime Skip Cuz I'm the Author and I can do as I Please~üåº

I glanced at myself in the mirror once more before setting off. I had applied light pink lip gloss and a little bit of blush, but other than my eyes, nothing drastic. I wonder... I silently thought as I gathered my stuff and headed out the door. What'll it be like to have real friends for once...
I bumped into something large and soft; a person. I looked up to see who it was, and a stranger greeted me.
He looked to be my age, and he had jet black hair with dyed white tips. His skin was pale, and he had long purple streaks running from his black eyes to the corners of his mouth. Odd. Ive never seen facial makeup on a guy before... The boy looked down at me as I was looking up at him, and he smiled, revealing two rows of perfectly strait, white teeth.
"Sorry, miss, I guess I wasn't looking where I was going!" I shook my head, and pointed to myself, mouthing,
"My fault." The boy cocked his head, and I pointed to my mouth, then drew a line across my neck. The message was simple enough, "I don't talk."
"Well, I am truly sorry for bumping into you, miss!" he said, beginning to rush off, "I hope to see you again sometime!"

üçÑL√® Time Skip to Lunchtime! (Yabba reference anyone?)üçÑ

I sat down at my table, which was now crowded with my friends. I waved, and my friends waved in response. I decided to try talking publicly.
"H-h-hi...g-guys..." I said, stuttering. Everyone gave me warm smiles and I smiled back, it was nice to have support again.
"I love your eyes, Proxis!" Chica exclaimed, looking at my eyes with interest, "The color you chose really brings them out and the flowers are awesome!" I smiled appreciatively, and Bonnie (who was sitting next to me) enveloped me in a hug.
"You're so...damned...CUTE!!" he squealed as he let me go.¬† I shook my head and opened my luck, pulling it out.
I had one of those lunch boxes that had those squishy sides filled with liquid, and when you stuff in a freezer overnight the liquid freezes, making the whole bag a cooler. And, of course, it was covered in bunnies.
