She said. "Sorry." I said with a smile. "Brooklyn can you please take their order?" my boss said pointing at the boy I was starting at and his friend. I walked up to them. "Can I take your order?" I asked. They looked up. "um... yeah, can I get a stake and salad." He said. I wrote it down. "And I will have pasta." His friend said. "Anything to drink?" I asked. "Uhh. Sprite?" He said. "I'll have one too" his friend added. They both said "thanks". I walked to the kitchen and placed the order.
cameron-"Dude you were totally checking her out" Nash said. "Dude. Shut up." I said. "So you were?" He asked. "She's a cutie." I said. I lied. She's more than a cutie, she's fricken gorgeous! She came back with our food and drinks. "Thanks I'm Cameron by the way." I said. Really? That was so cheesy. God where my game at? Plus she didn't even ask. Ugh.. My life is over. "I'm Brooklyn" she said with a beautiful smile. And she walked away. Nice going dufus. I thought to myself. She's probably never going to be interested in me. Nash was flirting with another waiter. And I'm here. Being a desperate piece of shit.
