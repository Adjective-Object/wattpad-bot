"Shut it, it sounded intelligent and I have authority so I can say what I want." Banks chuckled and shut the door, allowing Jade to get herself ready.

As she got dressed and brushed her teeth and the like, she couldn't help but feel that her training went by too fast. Five weeks ago she was a frail little thing, and now she at least had some small muscles. She used to not know how to reload a gun, and now she could do it with her eyes closed. Many tactics of stealth and fighting were also engraved in her mind, giving her a sense of confidence that she would be able to do a mission without being a complete failure. Five weeks ago she feared her trainers, now she made pleasant conversation as she practiced her newly learned skills. Five weeks ago she thought she would never have a chance at saving another persons life, now she felt she could do it with ease and precision.

Five weeks ago, Jade was in Ohio with Ian. Now she was in an underground training facility in California. Not for much longer, though. In a few minutes she would begin her trip to the other side of the country.

On her way to begin her first mission.
