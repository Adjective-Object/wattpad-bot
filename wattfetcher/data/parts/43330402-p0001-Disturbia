Okay, so before you continue, I just wanted to tell you a few things to keep in mind while reading.
1) This is my first book posted on the Wattpad app, so it's not gonna be perfect.
2) I am NOT a writer. At the end of the day, I'm only doing this for fun. There are most likely going to be many mistakes, corrections, plotholes, and somewhat weak characters that need fixing. If they're not good, I can't help that.
3) ^That being said, I can't make this book nearly as good as other writers could on here, but I can atleast put in an effort to make it readable. If you come across any grammar mistakes, please comment so I can fix it.
4) If you have any constructive criticism (which I probably need alot of), please don't be a bitch about it.
5) And for them haters:
If you don't like it, simply don't read it. No one's forcing you. And if you got a problem with that, I don't care. Suck my aśś haters.
