"Um, listen!" Italy tried to get their attention.
"Quickly. We may have defeated it for now, but it's very likely that it'll come back again." Germany warned them.
Italy could only look down. "... Yeah."
"But... America. Thank... you..." The Italian said, looking at the American who was carrying England on his back.
"... I think you should practise your smile a little more. You can't say that with that face." America said with a blank face.
Prussia suddenly heard something...from his....mind..?
((*snickering*
*snickering*
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU ARE--))
"Shut up!!!" Prussia shouted, covering his ears by reflex.
Russia placed a hand on the albino's shoulder. "Whoa! What's the matter?"
Prussia snapped back from his thoughts, "Oh... S-sorry... Er, did you just hear...?"
"Did something happen?" Japan asked.
Prussia shrugged. "N-no, it's nothing. Really, I'm sorry..."
When they were all done checking on everybody's condition, they headed for the iron door located on the second floor of the mansion.
------
As they opened and went through the iron door, they saw a flight of stairs. When they arrived up, they opened another door, revealing darkness.
"Ouch!" Japan exclaimed.
China spoke up in annoyance, "Who's stepping on my foot?!"
"So... who's on top of me~?" Russia said playfully.
"O-Oh my god. I'm sorry. I think I am. >///<" ______ said, sounding very flustered and embarrassed.
"Hey, that's my hair!! So, isn't it a little narrow here? And dark?" France asked them.
"Oh, sorry. There was a switch, but... Wait just a minute. I'm sure it was... around here..." Germany said, cautiously looking for the switch on the wall.
*click*
Once the light was on, they gasped. It was a considerably large room with beds, tables, a kitchen, and a bathroom. It was fully furnished and just what they all needed was most probably there. The rest were in awe.
Japan marveled at the room.
Russia turned to Germany, "Huh. Germany... did you...?"
"Wh-what the heck is this place?!" China exclaimed.
Germany went up front and faced everyone. "Hm. That went over better than I thought. Everyone is here.
I'm relieved that we didn't lose anybody. And I'm glad that we made it here in time."
"Awesome!
What is this place? Did you make it, West? " Prussia beamed.
"... It's amazing..." Italy let out.
France motioned at the room, "How did you do this?"
