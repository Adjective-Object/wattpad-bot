"Here you go. Good boy.!" Kyle said patting his head. Johnnie blushed and started drinking his Monster.
"Kkkkkyyyyyllllleeeee.?" Johnnie whined.
"Yyyyeeeeesssss.?" Kyle whined back.
"I'm boreddd" Johnnie whined and jumped on Kyle.
"Sssshhhhaaaappppp. We boredddd.!" They whined. I looked at my phone and it read 1:45 am.  I showed them getting up. They both jumped up and grabbed there stuff. I grabbed my note pads (cause I don't talk), and my bags.
"Shaphire.!  The bus is here.!" I started to panic as I walked to the door. Johnnie saw me shaking and put his arm around me like he always did.
"Its okay Shap. It's just warp tour." You say its just warp tour its my first time and I have been wanting to go for years. We walked on to the bus and it was new.
"Holy shit. They got us a new one this time.!"Johnnie yelled. We were all still in our sweats and stuff.
"Yes. Hey you guys are first so you guys get to pick the first bunks." The driver said as we walked all the way on. We all ran to the back and picked our bunks. I got the top right because it was dark. They got the top Middle and top left. When  every one started coming the bunks started dissapering. Every one got one but. Bryan.
"Guys share with me. I don't ..always bite. " Bryan whined for the hundredth time.
"No" every one but my yelled. Bryan huffed and pouted. I was sitting next to Kyle when every one noticed I was new.
"Who are you.?" Before I could write it down Kyle answered for me.
"She's my sister. She's a mute.." He said looking at me. Every one looked at me with sadness in there eyes.
"Buttt. I plan to change that this Warped Tour." I looked at Klye with surprise in my eyes. I shook my head and wrote down on my note pad.
"Impossible. I don't plan on Specking for a while." Klye shook his head.
"You will. I promise."
This should be a intristing Warp tour...
