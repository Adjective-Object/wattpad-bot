❝So you wanna play with magic. Boy you should know what you're falling for. Baby do you dare to do this. Cuz I'm coming at you like a dark horse.❞

I sang to the lyrics that played on my iphone. Walking around in my sleep wear. Taking in the cold wind and hearing drops of rain hit the window screen.
I have finally finished making the bed so I decided to sit and relax. I touched the warm cotton that was wrapped around my torso. It was one of my favorite sweaters that a loved one handed to me.
I smiled to myself when memories replayed in my head of mine and Louis' relationship in the past
Oh how I miss those days....
