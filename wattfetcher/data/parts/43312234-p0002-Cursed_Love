"mom you are emberessing me ! Ok ok i love you too "
So when she left i knocked the door and i heard a come in from the inside so i opened the door to find a blonde girl
she was so beautiful someone can be lost in her big blue eyes I was speechless i couldn't say anything I'm really bad at making friends so the girl began to introduce herself
"hi I'm bethany but you can call me beth "
"ah hi I'm lucinda you can call me lucy"
"ah nice to meet you look new don't worry you'll get used to everything here and you can ask me about whatever you want "she said smiling she looks nice maybe i shouldn't be that worried
"thank you" i said trying to look less worried ...
So i kept talking to beth the whole day she helped me very much i think we'll be good friends in the future however now i should go to see what classes do i have for tomorrow...
so when i was making sure for the billionth time about what i have for tomorrow something did get all my attention
it was a boy he looked angry i don't know why but what really got my attention is his green eyes... wow they're beautiful as ever...
but i quickly gazed away from him when he noticed that i was staring at him..
he didn't care anyway so however i went back to my room and i lied on my bed trying to sleep but all what was on my mind was those beautiful green eyes...
