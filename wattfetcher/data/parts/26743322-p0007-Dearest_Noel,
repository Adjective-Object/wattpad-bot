dearest noel,
do you remember that day? i do.
i recall the dark, gray sky. the grief in the air hung like a thick, wool blanket, draped over all of us. we walked in the funeral home as slowly as we could.
my family was all gathered around while tears poured down their faces, never gotten a chance to say goodbye.
she was gone this time.
my sister.
there would be no more laughing until our stomach hurt, no more me being intrugied by you two bickering constantly over silly stuff like who gets to put peanut butter on their sandwich first or who gets to hug me first, no more silly group photos or no more sneaking out to go down to the beach after midnight.
there would be no more.
she wasn't just gone away for a summer vacation or business trip.
she was gone forever.
both of our hearts ached with pain. mine full of fear, pain, lost.
if only that night never happened..if only.
i remember how i kept blaming myself that moment when her casket descended into the darkness.
i remember how you held me so tightly as if trying to put back my broken pieces together once more.
and that night you noel, you stayed all night with me.
and we ran off together after the ceremony to our spot.
and there noel, we shared a box of tissues.
dammit noel, i never thought you would be next.
now who's going to hold me?
i've lost everything i love.
and it's all because of me.
