Sad Story (Real):So you know how I said I volunteered at VBS for my Church? Well I helped with the Preschool class. This adorable, sweet little kid named Kaleb was in our class and he was 3 years old. He would never fight, argue, act selfish, or anything. He always shared his toys and was sweet. He had the cutest laugh. Thursday he didn't show up and Ms. Shelby told me his ear was hurting so he went to the hospital to fix it. Then later we got a call from his parents.........he was diagnosed with Leukemia. I feel so bad for him. He was a very special kid, he doesn't deserve cancer! ;-;
