EMILY'S POVI'm walking down an empty street and there aren't any street lights on. The Next Step's dance season just ended and everyone was going to parties tonight. Riley took my car to Michelle's house and so here I am walking home alone.
I feel an oncoming migraine, making me happy I'm skipping the party. I start crossing a street to get home when I hear a sudden roar to the right of me. A car comes speeding towards me.
"WHOOO! HA HA HA!" I hear someone shout from the drivers seat of the car.
The cars about a block and a half from me now but it's coming on full speed. My mind screams for me to run but I'm frozen in the middle of the street. I can tell the driver's drunk. He's holding a bottle in one hand and I doubt it's water. I brace myself for the impact.
I feel pain. So much pain is shooting through me I can't breathe. I see the car fading away into the darkness as my vision starts turning to white.
I think I'm dead.
