It's now 5, we have went on nearly every ride and the rides that take your pictures, so we now have 3 pictures of us the first is me hiding behind Mark in the ghost train and Mark laughing, the second is of is on the turtle that soaks you, Mark was trying to kiss my check in it, and the last one was the dipper, it was a roller coaster it took a photo of you when you went upside down in the loop, my face was pretty ugly in it and so was marks but we got it for the memories, that is so corny sounding,
"Can we please go on the freak out the last ride and we can go back," Mark pleaded, this was the only ride I hated and it doesn't help when you hear a squeak come from it every time it swings from side to side, "I'll be there," I manned up and we got on the stupid ride, the line of people in the rows was full, which is wired because it's winter, Mark helped me up and got on his own one, I had already put every thing down,
I grabbed marks hand as it went up and started to swing from side to side, it got about half way up to the top and spun around and done it again on the other side, gradually getting higher, after a couple of minutes it came to a stop, Mark jumped off his seat and came over to me, picking me up like I was weightless, he spun me around and set me on the ground,
"Are you finished," I laughed grabbing my shoes and shoving them on, "oh please you love it sunshine," he said winking at me, sunshine, I like it, "sunshine?" He just winked at me and we started walking to the hotel, I felt his hand grab mine and intertwine them, I smiled to myself, Mark stopped do I turned to se what he was doing, he pulled me forward and kissed me like no one was watching on this busy pathway,
He pulled away, "what was that for?" I asked panting, "just to show everybody that your taken," I blushed and he grabbed my hand, "you know I cried nearly every night when you left," he admitted, I turned to him "really, every night," it was quite nice to think that it hurt him as much as it hurt me, but that's quite selfish for it to be nice.
"You know, I don't know what I would do without you, I'd probably still be the old me if I hadn't met you," he looked down at his shoes and frowned, "the player?" I asked, he nodded a bit, I thought back to the day I saw Maria and him on the floor, "I'm surprised she hasn't got STDs yet," "who?" Shit I said that out loud, "oh, um, Maria," I said cautiously, he scoffed, "I'm surprised your brother is still with her," "o he's not she, she cheated on him," I nodded, "that's Maria for ya, how did you even come to think of her?" I'm hardly going to tell him I was thinking about them having sex, "I, uh, um, i thought that she was a player and I was right?" I questioned, he raised his eyebrows at me and I could see the smirk on his face, but I think he took the lie, he let out a breathy chuckle,
"You said no funny business, and your thinking about me having sex," I scrunched my nose up, "shut up," he rolled his eyes; mark stopped at the ice cream shop, "so what do you want, ice cream wise," he winked at me, "haha, I hope you heated the sarcasm, but I'll have a vanilla with marshmallows please and a flake with some red sauce," I smiled, he repeated my order to the man, "here you go sweet cheeks," the guy said handing me my ice cream and winking at me,
I blushed a little, "you better watch it that's my-" "fiancé," I said I wiggling the diamond ring my dad got my mum as her engagement ring I got it when I was 18, my dad wanted me to wear it because then it wasn't going to waste, I put it on my ring finger, and then showed it to the man,
Mark looked at the ring with wide eyes and then quickly changed it to a smug look, "that's right, sunshine," he smiled and grabbed my waist from the side and kissing my cheek, "sooty mate,"
"Oh it's not me you should me saying that to," mark said nodding to me, "sorry," I smiled, I liked this fake fiancé thing, Mark ordered his ice cream, poo bear with a flake, "where did you get that ring?" He asked "it was my mums engagement ring," I said smiling, I missed her so much, "I'm sorry for your loss," "its me that be saying that you got two things piled on you when we broke up," he shook his head, "my dad deserved it, he was a bastard," "don't say that I'm sure he loved you," he shook his head, "all he thought about was fucking my mum during the night and making me look after my 3 month old sister,"
