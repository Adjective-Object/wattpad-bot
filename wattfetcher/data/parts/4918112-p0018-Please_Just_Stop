Okay, this is aimed at the MCRmy, cause some of you royally piss me off.
So, for those of you who don't know what happened, My Chemical Romance broke up approximately a month ago. A post from Gerard on his twitter (which I only read cause my best friend showed me it), said in about 2000 words that it was just basically time to end.
Okay, this whole thing blew up about as bad as the Mikey Way Scandal did. And in about the same way, too. And, from what I've heard, people actually commited suicide after MCR broke up.
What.
The.
Hell?!?!
Okay, I'll admit that at first I thought it was a joke, and then when I realized it wasn't, I was devastated. But once I read Gerard's goodbye (much better than the original goodbye) I felt worlds better. We got a reason. We still have their music, and pictures, and Gerard's openly GIVEN US HIS ADDRESS so we can send him mail. We still have them, they just aren't together. Check out Frank's "noise" (that's what he calls it), I'm sure Gee will still stick around. I mean, he had released the song Zero Zero, which he had made without the guys. They're still here, THEY AREN'T DEAD.
And then there are the so called MCRmy members who now hate the band because of this. While I WAS looking forward to MCR5, and feel just slightly cheated in the fact that they led us on, they've done more good for us than they have harm.
Moral of the story is don't kill yourself, and don't hate the band. They have lives, respect that. Besides, now you can spam Gerard (although I wouldn't recommend it) so...
Seriously, guys. We're still a family. We're still here. We still have the music, and they prepared us for this. Now it's our turn to run, without them.
Now listen to the song to the side, and pay close attention to the lyrics. There was an encrypted goodbye in The Light Behind Your Eyes, and now that this has happened, I listen to this song a lot.
Keep Running, Parading, and Revenge-Seeking.
