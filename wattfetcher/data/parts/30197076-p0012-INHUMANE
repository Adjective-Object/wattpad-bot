An Idea occured To Me. Before I Could Comprehend Anything, My Hands Had Already Reached Out To My Pyjama Pockets As I Fetched My Phone.
With Trembling Fingers And Blurred Vision, I Dialed The Numbers Quickly, Crossing My Fingers He Would Pick Up.
Ring..Ring
Ring..Ring
Ri-
"Hello ?"
"Daddy.."
"Brianna ? Are You Okay ?"
My Hands Reached Out To Cover My Ears As I Slammed My Eyes Shut Tightly Trying Hard To Block Out All The Noise Outside.
"BREE, What's Happening."
"S-som-meone's I-in M-my R-ro-oom." I Choked Into The Reciever, Wiping My Cheeks Vigouriously.
"Are You Sure Bree ? Did You See Someone ?" My Dad's Worried Voice Asked Through The Phone.
"N-No..B-but I-I He's D-destro-oying M-my Room A-and T-there Were B-breat-thing M-marks A-at My W-window A-and Dad ,Im So Scared." I broke Down Into Racking Sobs As I Spluttered The Last Few Words.
"Dont Worry bree, Im On My Way.. Just Keep Hanging In There." He Demanded Gently.
I Heard A Few Shuffles Through The Phone, Many Yells Hush's But I Couldnt Care less, Some one Was Out There And He Wanted Me.
I Was Too Worked Up In My Mind To Realize That The Noise Had Rather Ceased.
The Atmosphere Turned Dangerously Silent As My Ragged Breathing Was All I Could Hear Along With My Dad's Shuffling Through The Phone.
I Stick My Ear To The Door, Trying To Detect Any Little Noise Outside But Was Aswered With Silence.
I Wiped My Cheeks For The Third Time Now Before Adjusting The Phone To My Ear Again With Both Hands.
"Daddy ?" I Said Quietly.
"Yes, Sweatheart ? Dont Worry, Im On My Way." He Answered Reassuringly.
"I-I Think He's Gone." I Whispered Lowly Through The Reciever.
"Wh-"
Sadly, I Was Proven Wrong.
Pounding Fists Pounded Against My Bathroom Door Suddenly Making Me Release An Involountary Scream As The Phone Slipped From My Hands And To One Of The Bathroom Corners.
I Screamed Outloud, Slamming My Hands Onto My ears As I Shuffled Away On My Knees Away From The Bathroom Door.
Even Though My Phone Wasnt On Speaker, Dad's Shouts And Yells Had Succeeded To Reach My Ears.
"BREE ? ANSWER ME, WHAT HAPPENED ! "
"DAMN IT !" He Roared Through His Reciever Before I Heard A Loud Crash Before The Line went Dead.
Hugging My Knees To My chest, I Hig My Face Inside, Resting My Forehead On my Knees Before Releasing My Ears And Wrapping My Hand Around My Trembling, Tiny Figure.
I hugged My Knees Further Into My Chest, Pushing Myself Harder Into The Wall, Wishing It Would Somehow Split Open And Swallow Me.
Seconds Later When The "Attacker" Realised I Wasnt Going To Open The Door, He Stopped.
The Knocking May Have Rather Ceased But My Thumping Heart Was Beating Eratically, Threatning To Jump Out Of Its Cage.
Suddenly, An Ear-Splitting Scream Sliced Through The Bathroom As I Clutched My Heart Dearly.
