This is my first part to a Ask/Dare book, fanfic, story, etc.
I will pick one question I like and mention the user who asked that question, same thing with dares.
I don't care how weird the questions get, because I'm the weirdest person I've ever met.
Freddy: "Can I come in yet?"
Me: "SHUT UP FAZBEAR!"
Freddy: *backs away slowly*
So, where were we?
I apologize for Freddy Fat-bear, he's just a big buttnugget.
If this gets too random for you, I suggest you just leave right now, unless you wanna stay, I'm fine with that.
Freddy: "OH WON'T YOU STAY WITH ME? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL I NEED!"
Hold on give me a second.
*Grabs old baseball bat from corner and walks out*
~Time skip 10 minutes of a Freddy beating cause' I can~
Sorry, Freddy just needed a temporary nap...from my baseball bat.
*Readers throw device and run away*
Crap, I'm all lonely.

So guys and gals, I want you guys to ask me questions, or dare me to do things with the FNAF characters via comment section.
