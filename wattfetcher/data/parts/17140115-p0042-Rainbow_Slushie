Hey guys! This is Admin Sprite. So, this is just a little rant. And my first. So, yeah. Amyways, lately, I've been into webcomics. The ones the I've read so far are Homestuck (I've kind of given up on it though), Sarah Andersen, Ava's Demon, Zoophobia, Pusheen the Cat, Battle Dog, and the GaMERCaT.
Often, I go searching for new webcomics to read with awesome art and a just as awesome plot. I go to Google, type whatever type of webcomic I want to read. I come across these sites with a list webcomics and descriptions, which is perfect, but then there is the horror...
They aren't in any order. I know it's not something big to you guys but it is big to me. I mean, how I am even good know if they're any good! What if it's pretty NSFW (Not Safe For Work) and I don't know because it's thrown at random next to webcomic that's practically for 10 year olds? What am i supposed to do? And what if the art totally sucks and even isn't that good? At the very least, put a NSFW section and a SFW section. Please. Anyways, that's my "rant." So, yeah, bye. Also, a thing to Nausicaa. Or was it Nausica? Anyways, I am so sorry I did not have Rainbow do your dare earlier. It didn't show up in my notifications box.  I'll try to get it in as soon as possible. Anyways, goodbye.
