"PDA!" sammy yells right near our faces. it scares the shit out of me and jack , and i bite his lip.
i thought that fucker was asleep.
"ow!" he says. "oh my god babe i am so sorry!" i say. "no, no, its alright , im fine, its just a little bit of blood" he says.
i glare sammy, giving him a look saying "you better run for your fucking life".
"oh shit!" he says. he jumps out of the car and runs in the house.
i follow him in and see everybody either in the living room or in the kitchen cooking.
i see other people, but dont pay attention.
"SAMMY FREAKING WILKINSIN YOU ARE SO DEAD!" i yell trying to get to him.
he was on one side of the table and i was on the other. he laughs cause i cant get to him.

"ha ha very funny Samuel" i say smirking. he glares.
"alright alright yall too , quit fighting and go get your crap and put it up" sams mom says.
we huff. "fine" we say. we both start walking out with him in front of me. i step on the back of his shoe, he whips around and glares. i laugh.
