Will I have to listen to a middle aged woman weeping and ranting on about her love life and how much divorce she gets?
Will an elderly man in his seventy's rant on about how much he hates the care home and he wants to be independent for once and nothing goes his way?
Or will a spoilt teenager come in the room with fancy looking dress, shoes and bag, and weeping how many boy always cheat on her and how "perfect" she is?
What will it be like?
And with that last thought in my head, I closed my eyes and slowed my breathing down, going into a deep slumber.

Hey Munchkins, I've decided to write series so why not summer series. Right?
Anyways, how do you like it? Is it too much? Too less? Do like it? Love it? Hate it?
Please comment below and maybe vote. Thank you
Oh and just a quick notice. Hopefully tomorrow or the day after, I will post the next update of 'Don't Call Me Princess' and 'Mr Jerk Charming'.
You're probably frustrated that I haven't been updating lately. Sorry. I have two or three more exams before they're officially over for this year and then stress will return the year after. So sorry!
And, if I get 30 or more readers on this chapter, I will update the next chapter soon. It all depends on the readers.
Anyways, thank you so much for your support on my other two books and so. Hopefully you could do the same for this one. Thank you and Love you, Munchkins. *Blows Kisses*
