"Who hates free time ?" I asked.
We chatted about lots of things. She turned out to be one of the nicest people here.
"I'm sorry but I need to go to the principle's office before the period ends" I said.
"Okay but first, let me take a selfie"  Aaaaaaand she started ...
...
.
"I arrived in time, Didn't I ?" I asked
"Yes you did Leena, have a seat. Mrs.Peterson will be here any second" He put his glasses on and browsed some papers.
"I see, you're a good student, your grades are high although you haven't been here for a long time" He took his glasses off and looked at me.
"Thank you sir, it didn't happen easily ... lots of books and dictionaries" I said.
"I like who works hard, and you surely didn't come for fun. From now on, you're my favorite student here"
"Does that mean you'll help me with Mrs.Petersons' problem?" Please ya Allah make this puppy face work.
"You're already taking advantage of me ha?" He laughed.
"I had to try" We laughed until we were cut off by the door slamming the wall.
The angriest woman in world 's prize goes to ??????? Mrs.Peterson.
Mr.Sean cleared his throat, muted his laugh and wore an angry face.
"May I hear the story from both sides pl-" He was cut off by Mrs.Peterson.
"This girl is rude and doesn't have a small cup of respect in her blood" She said.
"I'm the one who will judge, now tell me what happened" He said calmly.
"She came into class late, as always and started to to act all smarty to embarrass me in front of the class" She said.
The principle looked at me for an explanation.
"She was right, but not in everything. You see Mr.Sean, I really was late but because I went to the English teacher to explain me something, and your assistant already gave me the paper that says I can ask any teacher anything in anytime and I'm excused if I get late for a class for that reason" The principle nodded his head.
"So when I told her that, She literally said ' A typical Arabian Muslim, Late and unstuck' Which was an insult I cannot let go, so I corrected her. Ain't I allowed to defend Muslims and Arabs since I'm one of them ? plus, I spoke in a proper tone with respect and all I said was facts that proves that the sentence she said was wrong, but she blew up -excuse me for that word- When I said that she owes me an apology and when I said that there's nothing wrong with learning something new, which is totally right and she wanted to send me to detention, but I apologized to her after all of that. So Mr.Sean, If I was wrong I'm ready to be punished" I said.
The principle clapped for me silently.
"I think Mrs.Peterson owes you an apology too" He looked at her.
"But how-" She was cut off by the principle
"An apology Mrs.Peterson"
"It's Okay, I forgive her. I'm sorry too" I smiled at her, but the walked out silently.
"You didn't need any help, you did really well. You really are a smarty democratic" He smiled.
"Thank you sir, now excuse me, I don't want to be late for my math class and do this all over again"
