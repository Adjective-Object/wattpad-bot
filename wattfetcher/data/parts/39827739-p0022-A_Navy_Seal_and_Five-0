"Nice to meet you" I said and went to stand next to Danny. I gave a look to say better pay up soon.
"Well, Commander, I never thought you would look good with a mustache" Grover said and Steve's face looked confused. He looked in a mirror and I saw his confused face turn to a look of anger but not the hard core Navy-Seal anger more like the embarrassed anger. I held my hand out and Danny handed me twenty bucks.
"Nice doing business with you Detective" I said and put the money in my pocket.
"Why do you always draw a mustache on me when you see me sleeping?" Steve asked walking towards me.
"To prove that with Navy-Seal training you still don't realize when a little kid like me pranks you" I said. Everyone started laughing as Uncle Steve tried to get the mustache off of his face.
"You used Sharpie didn't you?" he asked and I just nodded happily.
"And you can't do anything to hurt me because you don't want me to do anything that would make it hard for me to breath" I said and I knew I had him because it's true. For the next two months I'm confined to doing office work. It was going to be a fun two months, I thought sarcastically.
A/N: Hey guys, I know this is a boring chapter, but it's really just supposed to be one of those chapters that sort of makes you laugh. More action to come. Please like and comment.
