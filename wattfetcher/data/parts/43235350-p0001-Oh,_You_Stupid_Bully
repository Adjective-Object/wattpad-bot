The world is horrible. Just terrible.
Who the hell wants to live a shitty, fucked up life?
Well, not me.
Right now, I'm going to do it.
No one can stop me.
My parents are at work, they would only scream when they see the mess I've made when they get home, and I have no siblings.
I have no friends, other than one person on the internet, but we barely know each other.
I can do this.
I can finally do this.
I can finally commit suicide, andno onone can stop me.
•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°•°I know is seems cliche rn, but it will get better. The character rn, which you are reading about, imagine it's yourself. Its not a "× reader" bc the "y/n" stuff can just ruin my mood while reading it, so I didn't. But just imagine its you, with your personality traits. Or at least can someone just send a profile of any character, real or not, with a picture??? Idk. But I hope you like reading this, I will update whenever I can, and ... Hopefully at least one person will read this.
