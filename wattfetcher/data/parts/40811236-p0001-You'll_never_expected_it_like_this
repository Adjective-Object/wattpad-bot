One super hot summer day I was board I went on YouTube and I saw a music video on my homepage.
I decided to click it, just to see what it was.
It was some Asian men singing and dancing. They was kinda good looking.
It was "I need you" by BangTan boy's. I love to blonde rapper.
I decided to look them up. "rapmonster" was his name. I thought "I always know Asians had weird names".
I continue to read.
Ohhhhhh Namjoon is his name.
His hot!!
So I got back on YouTube to listen to more of their songs and music.
I feel more in love with them.
I downloaded all of their songs to my phone.
I always listen to them.
Wow! They have better music than American singers.
But my parents are strict as hell. If they know I was listening to Asians, and liked THEM, my parents will disown and kill me!
So as much as I want too Ill keep my BIG MOUTH Shut!!
My friends noticed I have changed.
"Iyaaaa Kayla, stop dreaming"
"I can't help it"
"Whatever Kayla"
"It's the truth Alison"
"I'm out"
"See ya"
It's been about 3-4 weeks.
