As I said before my name is Lia and I can considered as a normal teenager with raging hormones and a bit quirky. But there is more to me like the fact that I can be bulimic if you don't know what that means well that's what googles for right? No I'm just kidding being bulimic means that you force your self to throw up by sticking your finger down your throat witch causes you to gag and throw up. And this can be life threatening if you do it often. I know this very well but I still do it maybe not as often as other people but I still hate my body enough to hurt it. The only times that I have done this was when I was angry or when I just felt fat. Let me tell you I can be very insecure when it comes to me stomach. I may be considered skinny but I look at myself as a blueberry a big fat blueberry. And even though I tell my friends that there beautiful and skinny I don't believe that in me no matter how many times people might say it I will most likely not believe it. I may act like this adorable cute innocent 13 year old but I have secrets. Secrets that I'm ready to share with you guys.
