"Really? I was thinking polyester. I'm pretty damn fake." Andrea cackled, pulling Jenn towards her.
Andrea suddenly looked worried. She grabbed onto Jenn, then released a sigh of relief. "You're real, don't worry!" The two shortly paused before bursting into laughter for the millionth time.
Andrea lugged herself onto Jenn, slowly kissing her neck. Jenn was unusually sensitive and let out a light moan. She cupped Andrea's face, pulling her in for a lengthy kiss.
As their lips connected, Jenn saw bright flashes. Every time she'd kiss Andrea, she'd see purple. Every time Andrea would kiss her, she'd see red. Each time they moaned, green would pop. Mixed together, everything was a symphony of colors. No composition by Mozart could compare to the music in Jenn's head, no painting could stand up against the perfect picture in Jenn's head -- it was all a flurry of everything Jenn had ever loved.
