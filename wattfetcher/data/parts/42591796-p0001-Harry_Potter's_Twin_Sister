No ones POV
The day Nicole Potter is born is the day her famous brother Harry Potter was born! He-who-must-not-be-named tried to kill Harry a year later, but know one noes that Nicole got the scar too. The reason she got the scar without being touched, is because of the bond her and her brother share. Their parents are dead because they sacrificed their lives for their children. A beastly man came and saved the kids from the burning home, Hagrid, was the name. He took them and brought Harry to their aunt and Nicole to their great aunt Madge, her uncle's sister. They didn't know how Madge would treat the girl, hoping it would be well but they were wrong! You're probably wondering who "they" is, it's Albus Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid. Wizards I might add! Harry's life is going to be better than Nicole's before she finds out her life at the age 11, but after 11 Harry's is going to wish he was her!!
