"Yeah basically." I said yawning, "I'm exhausted too."
"Well when we're done packing this away what do you say I carry you back to the bus?"
"That would be amazing."
"Then it's settled." He said and sat the boxes down in the truck, "How many more boxes do you have left?"
"Josh should have the last one." I said.
"Perfect," He said and quickly swept me off of my feet -literally- and carried me back to the bus bridal style.
I yawned once more and rested my head on his shoulder, "How was playing?"
"It was fantastic, the crowd was great," He told me.
"I know. Except the rude and annoying ones. I hope I'm not one of those fans."
"Oh you are I swear you are just so rude and annoying I don't even know why I'm dating you." He said sarcastically.
"Yeah I know. I'm such an ass."
"Well that's what Marcie says anyways." He told me chuckling.
"Don't even get me started on her." I groaned. Finally we got to the bus and I got down so we could actually get in.
"Well she came to Jaime and was complaining and it was hilarious when she called you an ass since basically the whole band pretty much went off on her."
"Really?"
"Yep, Jaime ended up taking her aside to talk about all this."
"I really hope it helps if it doesn't I might just drown myself in merch or something."
"Well she isn't the brightest but she's really sweet, sometimes." He said opening the door, "And you have to be on her good side."
"Yeah well I haven't been on her good side since I got here and don't even get me started on the fit she threw when she found out we're dating." I said and walked back to the bunks.
"I knew she had a thing for me." He mumbled following me back, "But she's not having me nor getting me. Ever because I've got you babe."
"Yes you do." I said and grabbed some clothes to change into.
He smiled and gave me a quick kiss, "I'm gonna go shower be back in like ten minutes or so."
I nodded and let him leave as I changed clothes quickly.I'll just take a shower in the morning, I'm too tired for that shit right now.
I laid down and pulled the blankets up on me yawning. I was so tired. Ten minutes I felt the bed dip and Vics arms wrap around me.
"Night Kells." He said kissing my cheek.
"Goodnight Vic." I said and snuggled up closer to him.
I woke up the next morning to an empty bed and my phone ringing loudly.
I blindly searched for it and finally found it, "Hello?" I asked not even bothering to open my eyes to even look to see who's calling.
"Kellin Quinn Bostwick your father and I don't pay for college so you can fail!" My mother screamed through the phone.
I rubbed my eyes, "What are you talking about?"
"You're failing Trig. Trig Kellin!"
"That can't be possible! I just got an A on an assignment last week!" I said fully awake now.
"Not from what I can see Mister! You better get your act together or we are cutting you off!"
