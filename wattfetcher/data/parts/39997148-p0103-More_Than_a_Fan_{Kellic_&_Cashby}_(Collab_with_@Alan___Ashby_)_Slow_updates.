"Kellin where do the C.D.'s go?" Lucy asked me.
"By the posters."
"Alright thanks." She said and carried the box setting it down next to the posters.
"I don't even get why you're the manager in the first place. I've been here longer than any of you." Marcie said in a snobby voice.
"Shut it! I swear to god Marcie."
"Well it's true, you only got the job because you're fucking Vic."
"I got the job because I'm not some whiney bitch."
"Yeah you fucking are, you just yelled at me for mixing shirt sizes!"
"Well you were doing it wrong!" I snapped, "Just get the hell out of here right now! I can't deal with you."
"I'm telling my fucking cousin." She said and stomped off.
"Tell him! I don't care!"
"Fuck you Kellin!"
I just rolled my eyes and kept working on putting the shirts away.
"Kellin you are literally the best person ever." Jason said smiling at me.
I sighed, "Thanks."
"Everyone else usually just puts up with her shit." Lucy told me, "It's ridiculous."
"Well I'm not in the mood for anyone's shit. I'm tired and it was a long night full of screaming girls and boys. My head is killing me."
"Yeah I get you man," Jason said.
"But hey maybe your boyfriend can help you out." One of the other girls, Alexis said wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.
I rolled my eyes, "No."
"Oh why not, I bet it's great being with Vic."
I laughed, "We just started dating guys."
"That doesn't matter," She told me.
"Yes it does."
"Nope. It's never too early to have a little fun."
"I bet he's an amazing kisser." Lucy said giggling.
"He sure as hell is." I said blushing.
"Aw! I ship it!"
"So do that guys." I muttered finally finishing all the shirts.
"Alright well I think everything is done." Jason announced looking around.
"Yeah lets load all this on the truck."
"So much work." Josh groaned and grabbed a couple of stacked boxes.
"It'll be quick don't worry." I assured him as I carried a few boxes to the truck when someone grabbed them from me.
"Here let me get those." Vic said taking the boxes.
"Oh thanks."
"It's no problem babe." He said and followed me to the truck.
"Just set them right there." I told him. He set them down and turned back to me.
"How was the merch table tonight?" He asked taking my hand and pulling me off the truck.
"Crazy and busy."
"So basically like it is every night?"
