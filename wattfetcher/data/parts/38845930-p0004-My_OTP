Jordan's POV
What was I doing? "I'm so sorry Erin." I said
"What?" She responded as she was cleaning her mouth.
"I'm sorry Erin." I said
Before I left and was so embarrassed, that I even drove around the block. "Stupid, stupid. What is wrong with me? What is wrong? My god." I said as I was pulling into Chad's drive way again.
Erin's POV
I ran after Jordan's car to see what was wrong but he pulled away before I could. I don't even know what to say to him when he comes back, aside from the fact that he is an idiot for almost making me throw up on the table and from at my house when he just stared at me like... like... he likes me? should I just ask him? what should I do? maybe I should go to the others for what they think.
"why is Jordan being so weird?" I asked Steve "Uhh, Umm, Uhh, Umm, Uhh, Umm, CHAD!" he said
~~~Flashback to when they just got there and Aurey was in the bathroom~~~ ~~~Jordan~~~ "Steve, I need to tell you something important and you cant tell anyone. Not even, and especially not Erin." ~~~Steve~~~ "Why not? What is it Jordan?" ~~~Jordan~~~ I think I like Erin... and should you ever say anything I'll hunt you down and kill you even if it kills me!" ~~~Steve~~~ "WHAT?!?!?!" ~~~Jordan~~~ "Don't you dare tell anyone." ~~~Flash forward back to now time~~~
"STEVE! HE LIKES ME!?" I asked in the angriest of voices.
"kinda." he replied nervously. I thought me and jordan were just friends but I didn't know he wanted to be more.
Jordan's POV
whatever the hell Erin thinks I hope its totally wrong.
