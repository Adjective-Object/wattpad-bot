"Oh ok so your mom was the one to misplace the book." She said getting up
"Yes, and I honestly never imagined that it would create so much chaos."
"But how did the book go from the public library to the schools library?" She ales pacing around her desk.
"Let me finish my story." I said rolling my eyes.
"Sorry continue." She said giving me hand gestures.
"So back to what I was saying, I looked for it everywhere in the library. I went and asked the librarian if she had seen it and if they had gotten new loads of used or old books and she said she had no idea. But one day at school they announced that they were having a book fundraiser and they had bought over 10,000 books from the library. I helped out with the fundraiser hoping to get my book back but I had no luck. Eventually I gave up and a month passed. That's when everything changed."
"What do you mean everything?" She asked popping gum into her mouth.
"That's when everything started getting crazy."
