it's midnight. The smell of nighttime in the summer invades my bedroom through my window. The stars look beautiful and breathtaking from my window pane. The fairy lights strung up on my wall illuminate the darkness, All Time Low playing through my headphones. I never want this night to end. And if you were a night, you'd be tonight.

I smile bc life. That is amazing. Now I can't stop.
