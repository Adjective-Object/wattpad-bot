astrid's POV

hey.
i'm astrid. astrid kelly. i'm sixteen, and i don't give a crap about what people think of me.
i'm a surly teenager. and i fit in.
i'm not depressed or annoyingly optimistic or nerdy or goth or emo or sporty or bitchy or overenthusiastic or smart or dumb. or anything.
i'm just me. boring. no one. i don't stand out, and i'm okay with that.
i have a few friends, we have the same views on this.
i inwardly cringe at people who don't. to survive high school you have to know that the people that get picked on are the people who stand out. that girl who was cyberbullied and depressed and hung herself. that boy you see with the lonely look in his eye.
my policy is, blend in. at all costs.
the consequences of not doing so can be disastrous.
