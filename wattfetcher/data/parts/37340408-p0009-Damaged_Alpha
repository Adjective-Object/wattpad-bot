Chapter 4
Acis
"Acis."
I look at her. Today is the day that I will finally ask her to be my girlfriend.
"Cee."
"Acis." There is a hint of sadness in her eyes.
"What is it, Cee? Don't tell me you've been cheating on me," I say jokingly.
She remains silent.
"Cee, what is it? What's wrong?"
She stares sadly at me. "Acis. I am so sorry."
I growl. "Stop stalling and tell me."
She fiddles with her thumbs for a while and lets out a sigh. She places her hands on her lap and tugs at a loose string on her dress.	"I can't be with you anymore, Acis."
My fingers stop playing with her golden hair. Her light blue eyes stare deep into mine.
"I...can't do this."
"Why?" I feel so anguished.	She looks around nervously, as if coming up with an excuse.
"I found my mate."
I stand up abruptly and glare at her.	"Don't lie to me."
"I'm not lying," she stutters out.	"
Yes you are. If you found your mate, than I would smell him on you. I don't smell anything other than your scent."
"His name is Orpheus."
I pause. "Who names their kid Orpheus?"
She chuckles lightly, the sound like music to my ears. "Apparently my mate's parents do."
"Why are you telling me this now?"
She looks down at her hands in her lap. "I wanted to make sure that...that you had a nice birthday yesterday. If I told you beforehand, it would've ruined everything."
I stare at her beautiful face. I know she's not my mate. I know that she eventually has to leave me. But why on the day I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend? Why on this day?
"I really did love you, you know."
I close my eyes. "I still do love you."
"If you love me, then you will let me go to my mate."
My rage sparks at this, my wolf, Dir, furious.
"Who said I wouldn't let you go to your mate? Do you really think of my as that much of an asshole? I know what mates are, and what has to happen. I knew this day would come, but why now? I'm still not ready."
"Look I'm sorry I ruined your day."
"I'm not mad that you ruined my day! I just don't understand why you would tell me on the day I was going to ask you to be my girlfriend!"
Eurydice freezes. "You what?"
"I-I..."
"Oh, Acis. Poor baby." She holds me close to her chest, where I can feel her rapid heartbeat while my heart breaks. She kisses the top of my head and I feel the tears on my shoulders.
"Don't cry." I wipe her tears.
