" justin " she called out
" what " I hissed   turning around
" can I get the keys " she asked
That broke my heart in two she didn't care that I was  out in the rain or pissed off she was gonna leave me here ...
" here" I said tossing the keys
And with that she drove off leaving me in the dust
" drive safe princess " I whispered  staring at  the spot where  my  car was once parked   I walked over to the  curb and sat down   and soon my tears mixed with the rain pouring off my hair then  I heard a horn honk and I looked up and my heart started beating when I saw my car sitting there
" get your  butt in this car " kylie yelled out
"  no" I yelled back  crossing my arms
" fine " she said turning the car off and getting out and sitting beside me
" what are you doing " I asked  giving her a really  look
" if your sitting in the rain I'm sitting with you "   she smiled
"  sometimes I wonder why I love you " I chuckled   which made her smile wider
Then I heard her sniffle oh screw it I thought picking her up and sitting her in the passenger seat and sitting in the drivers seat   I took the keys from her  and turned the car on   and drove towards my house  when I turned into the drive way I    applied the parking brake then turned the car off and came over to Kylie's side and carried her in the house     then I went upstairs to grab her a shirt  and me one   and I put on a dry shirt and dry boxers and some  basketball shorts  and took kylie some clothes  one of my shirts and some basketball shorts  I walked  downstairs and handed kylie the clothes then went to get us a blanket yes us when I came back with the blanket   she had already changed and her hair wasnt dripping wet so I pulled her into my chest  and pulled the cover over us and she looked up at me
" I hate when we fight"  she finally spoke
" me too " I said kissing her forehead
" sing to me? " she   asked
" sure " I said  stroking her hair  then I started to  sing softly
There's nothing like us,
There's nothing like you and me,
Together through the storm.
There's nothing like us,
There's nothing like you and me,
Together, oh
There's nothing like us,
There's nothing like you and me,
Together through the storm.
There's nothing like us,
There's nothing like you and me,
Together, oh
I looked at Kylie and noticed she fell asleep in my arms  I smiled and kissed her cheek and laid us down on the couch  and after a while I slowly fell asleep
