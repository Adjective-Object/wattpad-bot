I shook my head at him, "No Johnny, just no."
He put a hand on my thigh and leaned close, "Well you know where to find me if you change your mind." He whispered, his breath stank of alcohol. I crinkled my nose as he stood up and left the room.
"Ex's right? All annoying assholes." Alan said replacing where Johnny was.
"Tell me about it." I muttered, "And I have to deal with him the whole time. Not to mention sing a song with him."
"That's terrible." He said, "I guess I'm somewhat grateful mine is away from me."
"Yeah you're lucky." I said and took a drag off of the joint.
"Can I?" He asked gesturing at the joint.
"Sure," I said and handed it to the kid.
"Thanks." He smiled taking a drag and handing it back to me.
"Not a problem. So how do you like the kick off party?"
"Its fun, but I'm not a big party kinda guy."
"I'm with you, I didn't even want to come. My band made me."
"I have to take pictures which is perfectly fine, but I'd love to go to bed right now."
"I think you've probably taken enough pictures, you could just head on to bed now."
"No, no I wouldn't be able to sleep with all the noise."
"You can always go to Pierce's bus if you want." I offered, "No one's over there."
"No, but thank you though." He said kindly.
"No problem." I said.
"Sorry to like leave but I have to put my camera away, it was nice talking to you though Vic."
"It's fine," I said finishing off my third whiskey. "It's cool talking to you too." I said my words slurring a little.
"Bye Vic." He said getting up and leaving the back lounge.
I sighed and leaned back in the seat debating on if I wanted another drink or not. Might as well. I put the joint in the ashtray on the table and leaving back to the front.I stumbled to the front of the bus and messily poured myself another cup.
"How many have you had?" Â I turned around and saw Jaime standing there.
"Um, I think this is my fourth one?" I said my words slurring together.
"Are you high?"
"Maybe- but hey! You're the one who told me to have fun! And I am! I'm having soooo much fun." I said leaning unsteadily against the counter.
"You've had too much fun." He said, "I think you need to chill out a bit."
"No! I don't wanna! I'm having a great time!" I whined and took a drink of my whiskey spilling it all over the front of my shirt. Jaime took my cup and glared at me.
"Nope, it's time for you to get back to the bus and get some water into you." He said and led me out of the bus helping me walk since I kept stumbling and almost fell a few times.
"Wait! Wait!" I said and stopped walking and bent over coughing as I started to get sick.
"No puking on the bus!" Someone shouted.
Jaime grabbed my arm and pulled me quickly through the people just in time and I ended up throwing up, on him.
Jaime glared at me once I finished, "I swear to god Vic you're lucky you're my best friend."
