Stevonnie howled in agony as the wailing stone howled back.
"Argh!" Stevonnie screamed and rolled on the floor with their hands over their eyes. They were home alone and Steven had let Lion outside to run around. Stevonnie stood and scrambled to the gem temple door. The gem on their belly glowed and the door opened to roses room.
"I want a wailing stone translator!" Stevonnie shouted over the noise. The two unfused. Steven rolled and stood. He smiled and laughed.
"Nice thinking connie!" He chuckled. Steven stretched and scowled as his back cracked twice. Connie shrugged.
"I had a good teacher."
"Awww thats swee-"
"I meant Pearl."
"Oh."
The two burst into laughter and stared at the swirling clouds as it made such a complex set up. The wailing stone still howled outside the temple.
"What do think it is?" Connie asked.
"More like, who?" Garnet walked in carrying the stone with amythest and Pearl following. They looked the same as they had a few years ago. Steven and Connie were older now. Stevonnie hadn't aged at all.
This is not there story, but they are involved. This is the curse of the kindergarten.
