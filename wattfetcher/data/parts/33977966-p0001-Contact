I'm tired my eyes hurt. They say find something you love doing, it won't be work.Ten years of looking at this screen and listening for something. Is work! That was two days ago. Now my office is filled with people. A message not coded not pictures. Flat writing more languages than I new of. Some that maybe dead. Damn suddenly my work isn't work it's a royal pain. Well if I'm going to record this better give some back ground.
I'm Jack Goodalt. Chief of Project Listen the search for distant life. A non government, non profit organization. Worked for them ten years. The message was simple. We are at the edge of the solar system. We're the Hebra of the one God. We request a meeting. It's of importance to the people of earth. That's all I got a chance to read. Before all these government types showed up.
Figures English would be one of the last ones I looked at.
Systems officer any response from our message?
No Fleet Captain responded the systems officer. Well now.
Let's try this Miss York. This is Fleet Captain Davad Bloom.
We are the Hebra. Request a meeting please. Send that. Now systems next part. The people of Nabar send greetings. We are of one God. The Book of life first chapter says in the beginning.
No light only darkness. The one God said let the light shine.
The light came. That was the first day of the first cycle.Send that Miss York.Damn I need a Holy Man. Systems said sir I can request the Ships priest. Yes send for the priest systems.
"Jack you have got to see this," Jack scratched his head and looked at Nathan his only friend.
"You find a way to see? You know without them knowing," Nathan just laughed. "Of course.Does that look familiar Jack,"
