Y/n was worrying. Craig was late again for the date he agreed on going on with you. It was the second time and he promised to never do it again. He lied. Y/n got up and started to walk out of the restaurant and to her home. 'Maybe he's sick. Or maybe he's-' There, in front of her neighbor, Amy's, house, Craig stood there, eating each other's faces. Y/n stood there in silence. Then left. "Hey Y/n!" Craig yelled, calling my attention from the video I was editing. "Yeah Mini?" I replied, turning away from my laptop. "Listen to this song." I took off my headphones. "In the end of times. It'll be just you~" He winked."And me~ We're all alone. Waiting for one more show!" In the background, his PC showed pictures from our childhood. "So pack your bags from the air playing through radioactive sand." He held his hand out. "So take our hands, it'll be alright." I grabbed it and he yanked me up."Let's melt away tonight! It's the end of days!" He started dancing around and I started to laugh. "No one's going anywhere and that's ok." He grinned and twirled me."Take our hands and melt away!" He dipped me and my eyes widened in shock. "In the audience. In the audience... The aud..di...ence." I stood up, total shock plastered on my face. "So. Will you join me?""HAIL YEAH!!!" I yelled, jumping in his arms.That was when we were happy. I don't know what made him leave me. I stood up, saying bye to my mom as I left the house. What she didn't know, that would be my last good bye. I put my iPod on shuffle and a song came on. "In the end of times"Dammit! It's back on! I thought, slamming my iPod into the sidewalk, watching it smash into pieces. I kept walking, grumbling about how life will be over soon. I felt a buzz in my pocket and I took out my phone. It was Craig. He was calling me. I declined it and kept walking. "Ok class!" My new second grade teacher stated. "This is Y/n. She'll be joining us. So don't give her trouble." He sent me to sit next to a boy with curly brownish red hair. "Hi! I'm Mini." His British accent rang through my ears. "That's a weird name..." I said, cocking my head to the side. "Oh! Yeah. That's my nickname. My real name is Craig. Some of my friends call me Mini." I giggled and pat his head. "Then call me n/n if we're gonna be all buddy buddy here!"Little did I know he'd be the one..."Hey! N/n!!" Mini called out, running down the halls. Behind him was another boy. "What is it, Ladd?" He grinned and poked me. "This is my friend. His name is Brian but he goes by Terroriser. Brian. This is my friend, Y/n. Or N/n." I shook his hand. Mini gave me one of his cute smil- Wait. CUTE?! Oh dear lord! I can't call him cute!!! "Hey. Helloooo?" I jumped out of my thoughts and Craig was waving his hand in my face. "Oh right! Class!" We all rush down the halls. I came up to a big skyscraper and went into the elevator. "Y/n!" Mini called on the phone. "What woman?" I asked and he laughed. "I'm gonna move to America. You should come with me!!" I sat there. "Really?! You want me to come?!""Yeah. Since I love you. So you wanna come?""PSH. HELL YA!" The elevator stopped and I was at the top. I walked to the edge and stood. "In the end of time." The music started back up and I flinched. I decided to answer it. "WHAT?!" I yelled into it. "Y/n! She jumped onto me! I fucking swear!" "It doesn't fucking matter anymore goddammit!" I hung up and jumped off... Only to be caught by someone. "But you matter the most to me. I can't believe you'd kill yourself." I started crying. There I was, crying in Mini's arms and he held me. "Shh. It's ok. I want the best for you. So if you leave, I leave too.""What?" He took my hand and stared at me, standing next to me on the ledge. "Shall we?" I stood there shocked. Then again, there were people in the world out for me. Wildcat bullies me. Brian beats the shit out of me for being with Mini. "If it means to be with you forever." We both jumped and I felt love for the very last time before dying. xExtended EndingxIt was bright and I awoke. I stood there, blood splattered all over my back. Then Craig appeared, the same situation as me. "Heaven?" I questioned. The the scene in front of us changed and I saw our friends crying at our bodies. "Oh. I forgot about-" I was cut off by Tyler saying,"I'm glad she died but Mini deserved better!" Brian nodded. Mimi's face dropped. He held out his hand and some debris fell on them both. "I love my Y/n and my Y/n only!!" He yelled, glomming my. I laughed and we disappeared into the air. Sad but romantic story. All I need to say. For a contest but still here.
