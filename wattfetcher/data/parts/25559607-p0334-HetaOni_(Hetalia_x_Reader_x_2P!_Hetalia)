"Poppet! Tell them! Tell them you don't need to have your memories erased!" he exclaimed.



I tilted my head. "E-Erase my memories?! Why? What... you-you guys can't do that!"



"It's for your own good, ragazza. Why? Will you agree to get sent back home with memories intact?" Luciano asked.

America looked away. "They...They can't be trusted. They were probably going to kill you..."



"Bastardos! We weren't!" Luciano hissed.
