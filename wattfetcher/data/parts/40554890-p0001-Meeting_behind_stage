"Hey I'm doin fine!And I know I'm out of line!So I sing this one more time It goes Destination Permanent Vacation!"
$40 is how much my ticket cost.Getting money is really hard for me.But it was totally worth it.I paid 10 extra dollars for backstage pass.That's when everything happened.
I'm Cj.I have long brown hair with red highlights,my bangs go over my left eye,and my bangs are almost as long as my hair,I have gray eyes like a cloud in a storm,I have pale skin,and I'm 16.
I was wearing a black leather jacket,black skinny jeans,and combat boot.And somehow Michael noticed me.Of all people.
