This feels oddly familiar.


Suddenly, I felt someone's presence move closer to me.


"Oh~ Awake now, ragazza?" a low voice asked. This voice...


I felt someone untying my blindfold. When the cloth was off, my eyes adjusted to the sudden exposure to light.


When I did, I realised that I was staring into magenta-coloured orbs.



Luciano. It was Luciano Vargas.


What's going on? How did he get to kidnap me again? Weren't we in that room filled with the monsters?


He stared at me without saying anything for a while. There was something different about him.


"How did you get inside this mansion?" Luciano asked.



I furrowed my brows in confusion. "Wh-What? What do you mean?"


"Oh, please. Don't play dumb, ragazza. How did you get here? We're not asking you to answer that question, we're commanding you." he told me coldly.


Looking around, I realised that I was tied to a chair, just like before. The other Second Players were also in the room. But...they don't seem like they know me at all...


Why would they not?!....



Unless...


Unless...they haven't met me yet.


Widening my eyes upon that realisation, the 2Ps gave me confused looks.
The journal...went awry...and I was close to Italy...so I ended up...in the past?



Yes...that's right... I remember that part of the game... but this...?


"Ragazza, we aren't patient people here." Luciano warned me.
