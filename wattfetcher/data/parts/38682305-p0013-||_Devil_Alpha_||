~ 6:00 am~ I wake up to a large room. The cream walls had a large chandelier hanging. The black covers covered my body, and other small blankets surrounded me. I smiled and turned my body to the right, Luke's body laid completely still in the bed. I lightly ran my fingers over his jaw, feeling the stubble on my fingers. His long black eyelashes touch his cheeks, and his curly hair was spread on his forehead. Monica purred in my head just looking at him. ~1 hour later~He stirred and opened his eyes, he gave me a small smile and I returned it. "How long have you been up?", he questions stretching looking at the small clock on his nightstand. "Since six, I took some time reading that book on one of the shelves.", I say forgetting what shelf I got it on. He turned around and his smile faded, 'Oh god what did you do?', Monica whined. I gulped, was I not supposed to touch those??"Did I do something wrong?", I ask biting my lip, he looks back at me and puts a fake smile on his face. "No,no. You didn't. It's just, those books belonged to my mother.", he said with a small whimper at the end. I hugged him, and I could tell he didn't like all the negative energy. "Hey, you know we never finished the welcoming of our new Luna!", he said excitingly with a hopeful look in his eyes. I smiled forgetting what happened last time. I connected our hands, "can we do that today?", I ask and he nods excitingly! Okay Maria, you can do this, Luke loves you and now you're going to protect a pack, I thought to myself. I can do this.     ~At the ceremony~ My white dress, has small flower prints and I had on white sandals with a silver print. Luke was wearing a tux, AND LET ME TELL YOU!  OH GOD HE LOOKED AMAZING. We walked down the large stair case, everyone's eyes drifted to us. But Monica was going crazy,      'WITCH!!', she howled!I looked around but someone caught my attention. Her long golden hair reached her shoulders, and a flower crown was placed on the top of her head. We reached the end of the stairs and everyone stood up and clapped. I kept my eyes on her, she stood up reveling and short black lace dress that hugged her curves nicely. God she's beautiful. We walked towards a small platform thing, and everyone sat back down. Luke gave me a reassuring smile,     "Now it's time to welcome our new Luna!", Luke said and the crowd cheered.          ~ After the ceremony~ I received many hugs and I met lots of people!! The witch walked towards us and I turned to Luke. All large smile was planted on his face, as he gave her a hug. She turned to me with a large smile.      "You're a witch!", I said frantically. Her smile dropped, she turned to Luke.       "She catches on fast!", she joked as she talked to Luke. He lowered his head in shame.        "This is my best friend, Melinda. And yes she is a witch, but she's protected this pack since day one. So please respect her." Luke said in his alpha tone, I was a bit shocked he was talking to me like this. He never has before, is it because he's around Melinda? I shook away my thoughts, and gave a warm smile to Melinda, but she didn't return it. I turned around to get something but I couldn't find it, In a flash black smoke filled the air. I coughed waving my hand.Four other girls stood watching Luke and I. They all wore flower crowns but they were different colors. I looked at all of the crowns.    •purple, and green- Melinda    •blue    •yellow     •white    • black  I stood in silence and Melinda shook her head in a 'no' motion, like she was talking to someone. In a blink of an eye, they left. All gone, no smoke, nothing. I gasp, and Luke laughs taking me back upstairs.     •••     "Who were those girls with Melinda?" I ask laying in the bed. "And why were their crowns different colors?" I add.  "The girls with her are her sisters. Their crowns are different colors to represent their rank. Melinda is the highest Witch there is. Blue is the second, yellow is the third, and white is the fourth, and black is the lowest. It's mostly because she's the youngest, and she hasn't learned to control her powers!" Luke breaths out. Oh, okay. I nod and he smiles, giving me a soft kiss.     He holds me close and we're off to bed. ••IGNORE MISTAKES I WROTE THIS QUICKLY!! LEAVE A COMMENT AND VOTE? (;Thank you!!
