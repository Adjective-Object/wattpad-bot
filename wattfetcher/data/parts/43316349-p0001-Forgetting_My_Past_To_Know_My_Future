AN- okay this is my first story so please don't hate. I'm sorry if it isn't that great. ___________________________      "Mom I don't wanna go!" I screamed at the top of my lungs.       "You have to go!  No ifs ands or buts!"       "Ugh!  I don't know anyone!  Why did we move?!"        "YOU KNOW WE COULDN'T STAY THERE!! IT-it was too dangerous..." My moms voice softened. Her eyes filled with tears. I walked over to her and went to put my hand on her shoulder.       "Mom... I'm-"      "No, no. Just get ready for school. Please."  She turned away and walked out of my room without giving me another look. She probably is going to make us breakfast. Ever since we moved, me and her have been fighting every so often. Why did I even fight with her about why we moved? I KNOW it was dangerous to live there. I know that it wasn't safe to be there. God why am I so stupid sometimes?!  I shook my head and sighed as I closed my bedroom door slowly and walked into my bathroom to take a shower.  I stepped out of the shower once I was done and dried my self off and wrapped a towel around my body and hair. I walked over to my closet and put on my dark blue ripped skinny jeans and my tight black v-neck. I laced up my black converses. I walked back into my bathroom and blowdried and straightened my blonde hair. I put on some light makeup, grabbed my book bag, got my red zip up hoodie, slipped my phone into my back pocket and headed down the stairs. The sweet smell of bacon filled my nose. I walked over to the dining room table and sat down where a fresh plate of bacon and eggs waited for me. I picked up my fork and began to eat my breakfast in small bites, but I mostly pushed it around with my fork on the plate.  My mother noticed this and said,       "Honey. You will do fine. I promise." She smiled and put her hand on my arm from across the table.  I looked up at her and gave her a small smile and looked back down at my plate.  She sighed and stood up. She walked over to where I was sitting and took my plate from in front of me. She leaned down and kissed the top of my head. "Now hurry up sweetheart or you will be late to your first day of school. Love you."  And with that she took my plate along with her plate and walked into the kitchen and began to wash the plates and pans from breakfast. I stood up and took my phone out and put my headphones in my ear. I threw my book bag on and walked out of the house. I walked off of the front porch and started my walk to my new school.
