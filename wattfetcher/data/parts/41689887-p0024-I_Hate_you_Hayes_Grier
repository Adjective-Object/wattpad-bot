A few minutes later a shirtless Hayes walks out and I may have stared at his six pack. "Like what you see?" he smirked I blushed rolling my eyes, "Shut up." I said, he crawled next to me and we cuddled.
"What are we doing tomorrow?" He asked me, "I don't know what ever you want." I said he nodded, "I'm tired." I said, "Me too." he yawned, I snuggle closer he wraps his arms around me.
"Goodnight." he said I shut off the lights before getting into his grip, I closed the door and got into the same position, "Goodnight." I say he kisses my forehead and we fall asleep in each other arms
