I dedicate this bootayfull story to Tay Tay who is my bestie ( @divernegation ) and all my Olay Kik Crew! Sorry for my crappy English but I am learning it so you are allowed to laugh at it ▪▪▪▪"Caleb!"-Sais Peter."Yes?"-Asks Caleb with lots of books holding on his pale and soft hands."You forgot this other book"-Sais Peter giving the book to Caleb, whose chicks were getting red while Caleb was talking."Hmm... Oh yeah, thank you Peter"-Yells Caleb."No problem stiff"-Finally sais Peter winking his left eye. He knows how to wink his left one but not the right one. But none knows. Is his little secret."WHOOPS!"-Shouts Caleb because his mountine of books were about to fall."Let me help you"-Offers Peter. He was really kind... And that wasn't normal on Peter...▪▪▪▪They walk through Amity. They don't even know why they are in Amity, but it is a beautiful faction, and that is enough."If I wasn't in Erudite, I would be in Amity. They have really cute pigs in here"-Tells Caleb."I know right? Today I chased one and finally cought it. I called him Spider Pig"-Sais Peter happily."If I had a son, I would name him Spider Pig"-Tells Caleb."Yeah me too... Maybe we can..."-Starts Peter, but suddenly Tobias appears."Hey guys. Where are you going?"-Asks Tobias."I am helping Caleb with his books. Is there any problem ex-stiff?"-Yells Peter."No... Of course not..."-Sais Tobias winking his right eye. He knows how to wink his right eye but not the left one. But none knows. Is his little secret. Tobias smiles and go away.▪▪▪▪"Okay, this is my room. Go in"-Sais Caleb."Cutie room. Let me sit on this... OH MY FUCKING INNER SOUL THIS IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED I HAVE EVER TRIED COME HERE AND SIT WITH ME!"-Shouts Peter."Aha... yes it is really comfortable"-Smiles Caleb."But oh God! I am so hot right now"-Sais Peter looking the other way and taking off his T-shirt."God damn..."-Whispers Caleb.They sit together and stare at the wall weirdly."How did you get those abbs? Did you bought them on E-BÆ, cause man you are my bæ"-Sais 'joking' Caleb."Lots of workout, man! Do you want to tou-"-Sais Peter while Caleb is already touching them."Oh yeah bb. You have those guys done"-Whispers Caleb on Peter's ear.And they start kissing.They kiss.And kiss.And Caleb's hand goes from his abbs down his trousers.They get naked.Like really naked. Not even wearing watches. They don't care about the time. They just want each other FOURever.They touch softly each others egg plants, and it's the best sensation ever.They were both virgins, but not anymore.Peter is the girl in this relation ship. So you would guess what they do. Caleb puts his big boy called 'Spiderman' inside Peter's cave, and they have their best experience.Finally, Caleb's Spiderman throws his web, which Peter licks cutely.Peter's cave is red. As red as a tomotto. But they don't care. They continue lying on Caleb's bed.Suddenly, Caleb gets up. Peter stares at him. He is getting inside his cupboard..."Hey man, what are you doing?"-Asks Peter."I am going out the cupboard"-Finally sais Caleb, going naked out the cupboard.▪▪▪▪Okay this story didn't make anysense don't kick me...
