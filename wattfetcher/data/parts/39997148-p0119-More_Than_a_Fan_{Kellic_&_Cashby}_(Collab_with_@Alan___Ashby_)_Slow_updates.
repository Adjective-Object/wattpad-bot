I sighed, "Okay, did he uh did he say anything about us getting back together or anything?"
"Yes he did, but he still wants his space. He needs to think things through and stuff."
"But what did he say about us?" I asked, "Does he want us to get back together eventually or anything?"
He sighed, "He doesn't know right now. Like I said he wants space. He's confused Roy was really fucking with him."
"What was he telling him?"
"He kept telling him he loved him and he was making Alan feel good. Austin they were together for three years. They have history and that was stirring up Alan's emotions for him and he doesn't know what he wants but what I got was he wants you but he needs some time to think things through." He said, "He likes you Austin."
"And I really like him and I don't- I don't want to lose him. Not to an asshole like Roy."
"And he really likes you but he hasn't been with other guys. He's scared."
I nodded, "Okay, I'll just give him space until he figures everything out then."
"Good. Now I gotta go but I'll see you around Austin." He said picking the box up and running off.
I smiled now all I have to do is just wait and hope that Alan will figure it out.
I walked back to the guys still smiling a little. Slaves was playing meaning Pierce was going on next. When I found Phil he gave me a sympathetic smile.
"I'm sorry dude."
"I'm guessing you heard?"
"Everyone has heard. It sucks that he's leaving tour soon."
"He's leaving!?" I yelled.
"No one's told you? He's leaving in like three days. Something about his ex."
"He-he's going back to Roy?"
"I guess so. He proposed to him."
"I uh- I have to go." I said and pushed past him.
"Have you guys seen Alan?" I asked Aaron and Tony.
"I think he's talking to Kellin at the merch table." Tony told me.
"Thanks." I said walking out and avoiding what fans I could before getting to the merch table where Kellin was , thankfully talking to Alan.
"You're leaving tour!?" I demanded as soon as I got to him.
Alan turned around and looked at me with wide eyes, "Who told you?"
"You're leaving?" Kellin asked.
"Austin can we talk about this somewhere else?" Alan asked grabbing my arm pulling us away from the merch crowd and outside where no one else was.
"You're leaving? And you're getting married to that asshole!" I shouted once we were alone.
"Aust- stop please just don't yell." He said, "I didn't know how to tell you."
"Don't yell? I-I can't let you do this."
"Well it's not your decision now is it?"
I stopped and thought for a minute, "You're right."
"Exactly now I need to go explain to Kellin that was leaving which is what I was about to do when you fucking interrupted me and ruined it for me."
"I'm sorry Al. I just- I'm sorry this didn't work out."
