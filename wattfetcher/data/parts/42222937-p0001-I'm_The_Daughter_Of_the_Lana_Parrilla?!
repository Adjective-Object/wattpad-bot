I wake up and go on my phone. Today I'm going to San Diego! I'm going to comic con to meet the cast of 'Once Upon A Time'!! That's one of my favourite shows! My other is 'Pretty Little Liars'. I'm also going to meet my internet friend, Nicole, who I have been talking to for about 5 months now. I go on 'Wattpad' where I text her and open our chat. Prettylittleoncers2156: hey! Can't wait to leave for San Diego and meet you!Nicole675Ouat: hey! Me too! Prettylittleoncers2156: well ttyl I leave soon! I'll text you when I'm there! Nicole676Ouat: Kk byeI lock my phone and get off my bed and get dressed. I go downstairs and eat my breakfast that my mom made me. "Mm pancakes!" I say and she laughs. "Thanks" I say to her when I finish. After a hour we grab out bags and go to the airport. We get on the plane a hour later. "Honey, I love you okay? Just always know that okay?" I nod. That was weird. "You will find something out soon, it will change your life forever." she tells me "Umm alright" I say. I watch a few movies. We arrive in San Diego. We get off the plane and do everything needed and get our luggage. We leave and go to the hotel. We go to our room that has 2 beds and we explore San diego. We fall asleep at 9 and then wake up the next day and get dressed (media). I grab my bag I brought to take to comic con with me and mom and I go down to the shuttle bus. We get on and it goes to comic con. We get there and I spot a familiar face. Nicole! "Nicole!" She turns and sees me. "Hope!" We run to watch other. We hug each other. "Omg! It's really you!" She says "Yup it's really me!" I say and we laugh "Your a real person!" I say and we laugh. My mom comes up to us. So where are you parents?" Shes asks. "You'll meet them soon" She replies. "Okay" I say and we walk around comic con together. We get to the ABC area and we walk around the huge room. (they put all them in different rooms right? Idk I've never been). We make it to the cast of Once Upon A Time. I freak out when I see them. (Hopes mom stayed at the front). Nicole comforts me and then we walk up to them. "Hi!" Says Colin. omg Colin O'Donoghue just talked to me! I start to fangirl. "Hi!" I say back. "What's your name?" He asks me. What about Nicole? Why isn't he asking Nicole? "This is Hope" Nicole says. "Pictures?" Nicole asks and I nod and take out my phone. I take pictures with all of them. "Nicole don't you want pictures?" I ask and she shakes her head. Odd. She always talks about OUAT. "Okay.." "Attention! ABC's Once Upon A Time cast is now on break!" A man at the door says. "Come" says Lana to Nicole and I. We nod and we walk to the back room with the lana and Jen. The rest of the cast goes to eat. "Hope?" Nicole says "Yea?" "Wait! Did you tell her?" I hear mom say opening the door. Everyone shakes their heads no. What's going on. "Good. Lana can I tell her?" Lana nods. "Honey. I'm not your real mom" Mom tells me and stand in front of me. "What?" I say "Lana is." "Wait, What?" I say and look at Lana she nods. "it's true." She says "Now, you can come back with me after comic con, or go home with Lana. If you need time to chose that's okay." 'mom' says. "So my whole life has been a lie?" "Well not really, you lived it, so it wasn't a lie, Only your family was." She tells me. "I want to go with lana, she's my real mom and I don't know a lot about her. Sorry" I say. "That's perfectly fine, I'll miss you, I love you so much. But I have to go home okay?" I nod "I'll miss you too, I love you too." I say. She leaves the room and I turn to Lana. "Your actually my real mom?" She nods "That explains my last name." she nods again. "I can't believe my mom is Lana Parrilla! But who's my dad?" "Fred Di Blasio. But you won't see him, we divorced before you were born." She explains and I nod and hug her. "I still can't believe this" "One more thing Hope" Nicole says when I let go of Lana. "yea?" A/N I hope you enjoyed the first chapter! Btw Nicole and Hope are following each other on Instagram. Well,Love you all!üòòüòòüëãüèºüëãüèº
