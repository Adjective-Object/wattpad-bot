I hate that about being famous. Now my fans are going to hate Bella.
I saw really nasty comments like "Ew that fat whore is so ugly why would he date ghat" "SHES SOOO UGLY" "Ew who is that fat slut"
I looked at the adorable girl sleeping in my arms and thinking how could someone say that about such a beautiful girl.
Ihope it dosent hurt Bella, because she is already going through a lot with her mom & dad passing away.
I saw Bella move a little and get up
"Good morning my princess" I said kissing her cheek. I still havent kissed her yet. I want to mKe it perfect. "Morning" she smiled at me.
"Ugh i have dance today" she sighed. "I thought you loved dance" I asked. "I do but i want to stay with you" she said looking into my eyes. "Aww" Nash said.
We boyh looked at him then laughed.
*SKIP DANCE**
Its now 8 at night and I just walked in the door. "CAM" I yelled. "WHAT B" He yelled. "TOMORROWS MY COMP"
He walked closer to me. "Ugh that means waking up at 5AM sharp right" He whined. "You know it" I said. "Ugh Bella ur killing me" He laughed. "You have all your costumes and shoes right" He asked. "Yep" i said.
"Are you doing your solos" He asked
"Obviously, Im doing my 3 solos, My duet with Krista, and im only doing 5 groups to thus comp" I said. "Oh ok" he said.
We walked into the living room. "Bella its 9 you need to be up at 5 u need to go to bed" Cam said. "Why do u need to be up so early" Hayes asked. "I have a dance competition" I said. "I WANNA COME" All the guys yelled. "Just letting u know u all need to be up by 5:30 latest and there pretty long" I said.
All the guys want to come.
