John Cena•He likes to call you his champ. Even though in the ring he is usually the champ, he likes you to know that he couldn't have succeeded without you.
Brock Lesnar•He calls you his queen. At work, he decimates and destroys in the ring, but he likes to remind you that he still worships you and would never hurt you.
Dean Ambrose•He likes to call you gorgeous. Not only does he believe that you are gorgeous on the outside but, on the inside as well.
Seth Rollins•Seth is just straight out with it. He calls you hottie and his girl. He is extremely possessive and has even referred to you as "mine" a few times.
Roman Reigns•He calls you his baby girl and shorty. As your size compared to him is very small, he loves to tease you about it. Though, when he knows you are feeling sad or angry, he calls you baby girl to show his feelings.
Randy Orton•Randy loves to call you his little kitten. Compared to his viper side, you are exactly the definition of a kitten. Cute but, with claws.-YAY First chapter done!! If you have requests lemme know and I'll make it happen!
