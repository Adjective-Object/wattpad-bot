"May I sit with you Naruto?"

"Oh hey Hinata, sure go ahead."

Hinata placed her hand ever so lovingly upon mine. I smiled at her and she smiled back.

"You are amazing Naruto. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have you around to motivate me."

"What do you mean Hinata?"

"You never give up. You have always gotten up no matter what happens you've always proven to be stronger than any of us. You inspire me Naruto. I've been watching you push through all of the struggles you face. I just think that without you I wouldn't be who I am today and I thank you for that."

My face went red and I became shy very quickly. Seconds later Neji came to the table and he gave a serious expression on his face.

"Hinata come, you are to not be seen with the likes of him."

"I will spend my time with whomever I choose Neji and you can't control that!"

"Fine, become a social reject just like him and see if I care."

"Gladly!"
After school Hinata decided to walk me home since if I walk her home I'd most likely be mistreated once again. When we reached my home Hinata gave me an embracing hug. I honestly didn't want her to let go. We distanced ourselves and we parted ways. I walked into my apartment and who should I find? A legendary Sannin with blonde hair and gold eyes and her name is Tsunade Senju also known as the fifth hokage who has been taking care of me since I was a child.
