"Daddy please, don't take me there!!" I plead. "It's for you're own good, Aiden." Daddy says, looking agitated. "Well, maybe if you had loved me and Jodie none of this would have happened!!" I scream and slam the car door shut. I see some neighbors looking over, and some kids in the street stop and stare. 'Go for it, Jodie.' I mind link her. She growls. "Alright, let's go." Daddy says 'Retreat Jodie!' I mind link her. She comes back.
We arrive at Dr. Ness' office. I start to shake. My daddy slaps me. "Ow! Dad." I say. He rolls his eyes.
We arrive at the building and we walk into the paranormal department. 'Jodie, where are we?!' I mind link. She knocks a sign. 'Oh.'
"Hello Aiden!" Dr Ness says. "Come in, come in." She says. I nod. "Can you tell me why you're here?" Dr Ness says. "Jodie." I say. "She's the reason nobody likes me." Jodie breaks a cup. Dr Ness just looks at it. "Well, you can call me Jazz, because that's my name." She says. I giggle. "Well aren't you an angel!" Jazz says sweetly. "Now. What is this 'Jodie' you speak of?" Jazz asks. "She's basically a spirit. I don't tell her what to do. No one does. She controls herself. Everyone thinks she's my 'invisible friend' and they all call me names. Me and Jodie are fine with it. I give her permission and she kills." I say, in a creepy, yet sincere voice. "Can you draw her?" Jazz says after taking some notes, I'm guessing on all that I had said. I nod in reply. She gives me colored pencils and a pencil. I dump out the pencils, and draw myself. I am a very good artist. So, I draw me. Black hair, ocean blue eyes, Peach, slightly tan skin, blue shirt, and kakis. Then, I draw a line to nothing. Draw a cloud around the tip of the line and draw Jodie. "Done." I say, giving it to her. "S-so Jodie's real?" She says, clearly scared. I nod. "So you tell her to do things... And she does them?" She asks. I nod. "Yes." "Can you make her do something?" I nod. 'Go for the computer, Jodie. I don't wanna be here.' She growls. A few seconds later, the computer breaks. Jazz's mouth completely drops. "I-I'm gonna talk to you're parents very soon." I nod. She gestures me to leave. Me and father leave.
