So it's 03:15 a.m and we're leaving to Kerim√§ki. Shit... Mom will ruin this vacation for me. At this time in the morning, my usage is pretty much "Fuck these motherfucking goddamn shitty cunt-wanking fluffy asses every-fucking-where I'm so fuckmothering done with this fucking shit I swear to Satan I will make you smell a fuck, Hell's dickface... Hn... Damn..." .__.
Oh yeah! And guess who is driving the bus? My uncle. One of the many reasons I don't think dating in secondary school is a good idea is that I'm fucking related to everyone in this municipality.
Damn... There's no life in Savonranta. Only some crazy old man cursing at seagulls. I think they ate his dog or some shit...
When my alarm rang, I was so high on the smell of my sheets, that it took me ten minutes to get the password of my phone right. I just tried to write my name without realizing that I can only type four numbers.
HOLY PERKELE IT IS FOGGY AS HECK HERE * 7 *
I have mosquito bites all over myself... I can't scratch....
Oh o__o Mom and Dad are talking about going to Southern Europe to a vacation some summer. I would love to go to Spain, Italy, Portugal-- //slapped
Meh... Wish me luck. Hopefully I won't sit my ass flat or die!
