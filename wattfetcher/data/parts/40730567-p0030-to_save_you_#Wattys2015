Jake,
I love you. I love you so much. And I want to tell you everything through a letter, because by the time you understand the seriousness, the intensity of my love, it will be too late. It was when we were 13, hitting puberty and all that, when I understood what I felt for you was fondness, not hatred. I was so scared, and I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Everything felt different with you from then on. Getting mad at you became my cover-up, and I only wanted you to hate me. It was somewhat because of Mandy being my best friend. But more of it was because of my dad leaving my mom after I was born. If that was what love was, I didn't want to feel it. but you made me feel, Jake. And I hate you so much for that. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Most of all, I hate you for unknowingly making me fall in love with you. When Adalyn died, you became quiet. I didn't like that. But I couldn't make you think that I cared. I never wanted you to find out Jake. But you did. Fate has other plans. Well that's all in the past now. I wish I had never fallen in love with you. I wish I could just move on from you like you never mattered. But the truth is I AM in love with you, and you matter a lot to me. And we cant change that. Just promise me to not be upset, I was tired, tired of living. Tired of pretending. Tired of being sad. I wanted it to be over. None of this is your fault. Promise me to find what you love, and do that. Move on Jake. Embrace all the good things in life. Be happy. Make memories. And when you go to sleep at night, you'll be happy. Find a girl and tell her you love her. Kiss her hard and never let her go. Jake please promise me to do everything that makes you happy. Signing out.
Abrielle
