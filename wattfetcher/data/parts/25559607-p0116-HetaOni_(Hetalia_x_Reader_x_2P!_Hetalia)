The blonde haired Italian looked away, not wanting his brother to see that glint of sadness in his eyes.
"She did seem to be telling the truth when she said she knew us. Hell, she even knew that this guy's a vegan and that I hunt poachers." Matt said, pointing at his brother and them to himself.
"Yeah. Funny, she seems okay to hang out with. I mean, she knows innuendos, too. Haha." Allen chuckled.
"Tch. Stop screwing around. We just need her to tell us how to give the rest of those 'First Players' their 'Game Over'. Then, we'll send her back to her world." Luciano told them.

....If I went back... they wouldn't get mad at me... would they?
They'd say sorry, and they'd yell a lot and scold me, and then...
They'd... hug me, and I'd hug them... and I'd also say I'm sorry...
All this time... Really, all this time... I
...... with them... from here
..."
Suddenly, a monster appeared before him. This Steve was about thrice as large as the usual ones. It started approaching Italy.
"Ts??!!

"Please...Ollie." I pleaded.
"________, poppet..." he sighed.
I pulled away from him and started walking over to the long table. I just sat on one of the chairs in silence.
"Ollie...I have a question."
He suddenly perked up and approached me, "What is it?"
