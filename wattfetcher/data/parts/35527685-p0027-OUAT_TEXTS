QueenOfHearts : Regina
YourMajesty : What do you want mother? Is Zelena too busy for you?
QueenOfHearts : Yes but that's beside the point. Why don't you like Miss Swan?
YourMajesty : I do like her
QueenOfHearts : Ha ha ha I knew it Swanqueen forever!!!
YourMajesty : As a friend. I hate to break it to you but I'm in love with Robin and that won't change.
QueenOfHearts : But he's gone!!!
YourMajesty : Our love remains!
QueenOfHearts : Yeah like your love for the stable boy?
YourMajesty : his name was Daniel and he is still in my heart.
QueenOfHearts : sure.
YourMajesty : Why do you want me with Emma so badly? She defeated you in the enchanted forest.
QueenOfHearts : You need someone who can take care of you...not some thief who lives in new York!
YourMajesty : I love Robin end of discussion.
