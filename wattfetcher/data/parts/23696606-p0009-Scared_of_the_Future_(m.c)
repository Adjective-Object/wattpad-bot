Lilith's P.O.V
~~~~~~~~~~
My feet were hanging over the edge of the hospital bad. I had changed back into Michael's clothes, and was now waiting form him and Ashton to return. I debated whetherÂ to tell him or not. If I told him, He'd probably think I'm completely nuts. I looked down at my dark blue vans. I hated lying to him. And it was weird. I've only known him for four days, yet he means so much to me. I don't wanna loose him. Ever.
He came walking in seconds later, with Ashton. "We're back" he announced. He handed me my drink and I quickly drank it, my throat already feeling much better.. "Thanks," I breathed out as I finished and threw the now empty box in the thrash-can by the bed."How are you feeling? You gave us a good scare yesterday." Ashton giggled, yet he sounded worried. I sighed before answering; "I feel fine, just a headache, s'all." Ashton nodded before walking over to me, reaching out his hand. "Let's get you outta here, yeah?" He smiled down at me, and I smiled back nodding.
I took his hand and tried standing up, but my feet gave in and I fell. "Whoa, easy there" Michael chuckled and helped me back up. I looked at him with pleading eyes. "Michael," I pouted my lips, faking a sad look. "Can you carry me?" He smiled, shaking his head and laughing. "Of course, Princess." Princess. He called me Princess! He lifted me up bridal style and we exited the room. "I'll go talk to the receptionist." Ashton said before disappearing around the corner.
Michael continued carrying me down the halls. I looked at him, and before I could think, I asked; "Michael, do you believe in monsters?" as soon as I realized what I've said, my hands flew from his neck to cover my mouth.He looked at me surprised before answering. "Erm...I don't know...yeah, I guess?" My eyes widened and I removed my hands from my mouth. "Really?" I dragged out the word, making it sound more dramatic. "Yeah. There are some things out there that we can't explain. And i believe that there is in fact other creatures than humans and animals on the earth:" I nodded, and we exited the hospital, looking for Ashton's car.
