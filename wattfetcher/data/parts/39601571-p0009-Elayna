My dogs are annoying me😕
Well just one of them. she keeps laying on me and following me around.
I have really bad allergies, like I'm allergic to everything and we just recently got this dog so I'm not use to it yet😦
It's a really small dog and its white and fluffy, I thought it was a rag so I tried to kick it😂😑 I feel bad.__________________
I took a nap today and I felt super sick when I woke up again😖
I've been trying to stay off line but it's been hard 😔
1) I have no face-to-face social life so u have no one to talk to😂🌚
2) idk I love the internet so this is a big challenge for me 😑
So sorry if u text me or something and I don't answer I might just be ignoring u or just everything so.
I'll be in WattPad for a little while so if u want to contact me do it this way!
Comment though cuz I noticed sooner ✌🏼
