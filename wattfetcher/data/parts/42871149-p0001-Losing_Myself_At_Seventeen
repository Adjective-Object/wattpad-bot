Well to start off, this is all going to get real personal. I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada while my dad was in jail for god knows what. My parents met in a casino. I've heard stories from both of them about dumpster diving, drug use, and getting into physical fights with each other. All I gathered was my mom got money from her "sugar daddy" and headed to Nevada and my dad, well he was just trying to make a go of his air brushing while partying like a 20 year old everynight.    But lets fast forward. My dad gets out of jail, gets me, goes to his family in Pennsylvania and then gets my mom. But now they hate each other and somewhere along the way my dad got custody of me. I have to be honest, that's about all I know about my mom and dads history before me and me as a newborn.      Now I'm fast forwarding again. My dad gets this sleaze bag of a girlfriend. They had a kid together, which would be my half sister, she was adopted into a Mennonite family  because they weren't fit to be parents. Since my half sister was taken away, my dad was told to find a home for me. I lived with my babysitter for awhile until she told my dad I was raising her electric bill too high.  After that I went to live with my grandparents for three year. In those three years I've seen my grandfather die of cancer, my dad put in jail by that sleaze ball, and then being told me and my dad would have to find a place to go. Which is understandabke, my grandma couldn't keep up with all the yard work and house work anymore.
