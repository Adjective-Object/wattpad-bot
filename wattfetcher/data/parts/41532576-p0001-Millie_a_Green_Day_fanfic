-Billies povThank you so much for coming out here tonight! Billie said to the huge crowd of his fans after there last song of the night, after billie had thanked the fans for coming they went back behind stage as the crowd started to get ready to go. That was the best show yet Mike said to the band as they sat down to relax i think so to Mike said Billie as he looked at mike, Billie had seen Mike lying on the floor trying to relax and then saw the pet collar necklace he was waring. Billie had thought about his friend Mike for a while now but in a different kind of way, as if he had feelings for his best friend...no that cant be he thought as he got up and went to go get cleaned up and start to head home. As he driving home after he told everyone one bye, that one thought came to him "y'know you like him" Billie thought but wasn't to sure on what to do so he decided he would go out and pic up some drinks, he went into the seven o eleven and got a couple of beers and brought them home. Once Billie had gotten home he went to his room and sat on the edge of his bed and opened one of the drinks and thought about his "best problem" and soon after half of his only first beer he had set it aside and went to sleep.
-Mikes povAs mike woke up the next morning from the concert he started to think about the way Billie had stared at him before every one left but Mike brushed it off and went on his social media more pacifically his Instagram and had seen the photos of the concert from yesterday and after sometime he noticed people have been tagging him on someones photo one he didn't really need to see but it was a very good fan art of him and Billie, ... Wait what us...together he thought as he stared blankly at his phone screen. Ummm i don't know about this were just friends, at least Mike thought, Mike asked him self for the third time ... well if this was true i guess I wouldn't mind it what, no! you guys are just friends. Mike had kept thinking on what he felt towards his best friend that he had known for so long now, did he really want to ruin this, after about 20 minutes of looking at one of his fans fan art he started to pick the choice of "yes I think I do have feelings for my best friend" he didn't know if he wanted to feel like this was a good answer or not, he thought that he really needed to talk to Billie about this so he decided he would go over to his house later so he would have time to get ready.
-Billies povI woke up and decided to finish off the rest of the beers I bought yesterday no point in wasting them, he finished off two and a half beers, soon getting him drunk, he then soon heard a knock at the door he slowly got up while almost falling on his face but managed to get the the door and to see Mike. He opened the door more and fell as he stepped aside for Mike to come in causing him to to sit there as he tried to focus on what just happened
-Mikes povI watched as my best friend fall to the ground i think he's drunk "aww so cute when he's drunk" god, not now for those thoughts now go help your friend Mike told himself as he helped Billie to his room but Billie couldn't stand up, Mike then started to pick Billie up bridal style to his room as he thought "how much did he drink?" He then saw the empty beer cans Billie had drank earlier. Once Mike brought him to his bed Billie wouldn't let go of Mike, as if he thought he was having a nightmare and just wouldn't let go. Mike had finally got him to lay down. So Billie what happened last night, Mike said as if he was asking a little child who had gotten into trouble.
-Billies povBillie had heard the question but was to scared to answer with what he really wanted to say. Bille had noticed Mike still had the collar on.. Billie had looked up at Mike and swooped up to the collar necklace of Mikes and yanked it down making Mike do exactly what billie wanted, making him come down to his level from him sitting on the edge of the bed and began to kiss mike with his eyes closed.
-Mikes povMy eyes went wide "either Billie doesn't know what he's doing or he really does like me" I wasn't to sure on what to do so i just stayed there stunned on what was happening. After Billie let me go i stood back up and saw Billie had looked at the ground and started to cry a little I then knew that it was a true kiss and he did like me. So there for he thinks i don't like him, well i finally made up my mind. I used my hand to lift Billies head up to look at me I then leaned down and kissed him, I knew he liked it because he kissed back. Just so he gets the point that i made up my mind,I pushed him on his back by his shoulders into the bed and towered over him making him reach up and started to rub my sides making me laugh. He saw this has his opportunity and flipped me around so that he was sitting on my waist and started to rub my sides making me laugh it seemed that now we both know the real feelings for each other because Billie had seemed more happier now. After a few minutes of that I started to get over the ticklish part and now I can clearly see were Billie is wanting to take this.
