"Yesterday, I had one of the worst mornings I could have had. I cried all morning. I was sobbing. I felt like everyone and everything was against me. I broke. That's what happened. I wanted to get out of there. I walked every corner of the place. I cornered myself against a door and cried. They thought I was over reacting. That I was doing this to manipulate. To turn out as innocent. I was not trying to do anything. I just wanted them to shut up! To understand that I didn't feel content.
I get it! I get it! I messed up. I messed up now and I messed up before. But let me breath. You're suffocating me. I don't have space. I want to get out.
Let me breath for a moment. All you do is blame me. Or at least, that's how it feels."
