I suppose I was better at writing when I was closer to death. The pain ridden days when I fought tears from my eyes, only to allow them all to break free behind a closed door. Or the days when instead of tears, I was struggling to stop the blood that flowed down my arms. When I had run out of the salted water in my eyes, and I lay, silently. Slowly feeling my heart breaking only a little at a time. When my teachers would beckon for my attention, to be overruled by the thoughts of my immediate passing. When my smoking wasn't spastic, instead as often and as many as I could get. The days I stared blankly at everyone I knew, with my mind always preoccupied. When I was sick.
I suppose, then, I had something better to write about, and now my bland personality has begun to shine.
