I don't own HTTYD or its characters. I don't own the song, Hush Hush by Avril Lavigne either.


Chapter 1: Astrid's Letter
To Hiccup,
This is a song I wrote for you Hiccup. It's called Hush Hush. I hope you like it.
I didn't mean to kiss you
You didn't mean to fall in love
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant for it to mean this much
Hush hush, now.
I wanted to keep you forever next to me
You know that I still do
All I wanted was to believe
Hush hush, now
So go on, live your life. So go on, say goodbye.
So many questions but I don't ask 'why?'
So this time I won't even try
Hush hush, now
When I try to forget you, I just keep on remembering
What we had was so true, but somehow we lost everything.
Hush hush, now
So go on, live your life. So go on, say goodbye,
So many questions, but I don't ask 'why?'
Maybe someday, but not tonight
Hush hush now
Don't don't don't you ever say a word(word)
Of what you ever thought you heard(heard).
Don't you ever tell a soul(what you know)
I tried to hide but I still believe
We, that we were always meant to be(be)
I could never let you go.
Hush hush now.
So go on live your life, so go on say goodbye.
So many questions but I don't ask 'why?'
So this time I won't even try
Hush hush now.
Hey, Hiccup, it's me, Astrid, just wanted to say I miss you! I'm so sorry about what I said about your mother! Please don't leave Berk! I need you! For the rest of mylife!
Love forever and always,
Astrid Hofferson

*Hiccup's POV*
I felt a tear stream down my face. Astrid was really sorry. Whenever she writes a songs for someone in particular, you knew that she's sorry.
She was mad at me (Noah/A/N: I'm thinking about a prequel, but I don't know, yet. Tell me if I should) and letting stupid things flow out of her mind. So, then she went and said something mean about my mother.
When I was really little, about four, my mom was taken away by a dragon.
