"I remember once when I was kid one of our neighbors shot himself and I asked my mom why he would do it. She said that sometimes people get so sad that they can no longer be happy and that they get so sad they can't live anymore. And I told her that I didn't understand. When she looked at me she looked so sad and she whispered quietly, 'I hope you never do.'"
