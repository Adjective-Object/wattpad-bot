I got up for school like normal, change into my school uniform, brushed my hair and teeth, made breakfast, and left a note to my mom and dad on the table then left saying "good morning i love you both". When i got to school my teacher was acting really weird he kept giving me looks. I was thinking about it all day.When i got home my mom was crying and the police was their of course i asked her what was going on. "your dad was killed." She said I past out.......
Ok i hoped you all like it so far!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
