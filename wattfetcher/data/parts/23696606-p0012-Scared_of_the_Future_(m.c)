"Hey Lilith! Damn, I was worried! I've been trying to reach you all day!" Calum sounded relieved. I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen.I did in fact have over 10 missed calls, mostly from Calum. I put the phone back to my ear before answering. "Um, yeah, sorry. I was at the hospital." "What?! Are you alright? What happened?" Calum panicked. "Yeah, I'm OK. Just an allergic  reaction to something, no biggie." I trailed off, eager to end the conversation. "You sound upset. Did I say or do anything?" He sounded slightly calmer now, but I felt bad for making him feel like it was his fault. "What, no! It's just, I'm a bit busy at the moment." I started biting my nails, a nervous habit I have. I glanced over at the boys, who seemed to be focused at their game of Halo. "With what?" damn, he was curious. "Guests," I simply answered and Michael looked at me in his side sight. "Oh, okay. I was just wondering if you're up to hanging out sometime soon." My lips arched up slightly as I answered; "Yeah, I'd love that. What about you give me a call tomorrow?" I suggested, getting up from the couch. "Sure, great! Talk to you then." I said a quick 'bye' before hanging up and throwing the phone on the couch.
"Who was it?" Michael asked as he put down his controller."Just someone I met the other day. Why?" I replied and walked into the kitchen to grab three glasses. "The name just sounded familiar." Michael answered and got up as well. I walked back into the living-room with three black drinking glasses. "Calum?" I arched an eyebrow at him as I put the glasses down on the table. Now the name seemed to catch Ashton's attention as well, as he almost dropped his controller.
"Calum?" he asked, looking at Michael with wide eyes. Michael huffed before nodding and looking back at Ashton. I walked back to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of Dr.Pepper from the fridge before returning to the living-room. "It's a special name, Isn't it?" I said as i opened the bottle and pouring some of the drink into the glasses. "Yeah, you bet." Michael sounded irritated, maybe even angry. "Do you know him or something? Why are you acting like this?" I asked him as I took my glass and sat back down on the couch. Michael chuckled darkly and Ashton stayed quiet as he reached for a glass. "Yeah, we know him alright." Michael said and started pacing back and forth in front of the TV. I felt my heartbeat increase and looked over at Ashton. He caught my glance and quickly looked away. "Guys, you're making me nervous. Is he like an ace-murderer or something?" I put my glass down on the table with a shaking hand. "Oh, he's something way worse than that." "Michael" Ashton said in a pleading, yet stern voice, and Michael sighed and slumped down on the couch again. He put his head in his hands and groaned.
"We screwed up Ash. We had one fucking job, and we screwed it up!" Michael exclaimed. At that moment,  I felt a million emotions at once. Confusion, anger, fear, curiosity, surprise, wonder, nervousness, and the list goes on. I pulled slightly away from Michael as Ashton stood up, clearly worried. "Michael, we didn't know. I bet she doesn't know either. Let's just not do this here, ok? C'mon, well go home." I felt a pang of guilt. Did I do anything? Are they leaving because of something I said? Michael sighed and nodded. I sat quiet. I couldn't process this. He looked over at me and his eyes... looked sad, and somewhat shameful."I'm sorry Lilith," was all he said before he and Ashton was up and walking out the door. And I just sat there, with a thousand questions. I pinched myself. I wasn't sure how to feel. So I just sat there thinking until I fell asleep.

Calum's P.O.V
~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as Lilith hung up, I put my phone back into my pocket. I stepped over the cold body laying on the floor, flies already finding the dead meat appealing. "So, what did she say?" I turned around, grinning. "She said yes. We'll be meeting up tomorrow, my lord." I answered respectfully. "Good, good. And what the time is right, you shall bring her to me, yes?" I nodded immediately. "Yes, my lord. But if I', allowed to ask, what exactly is your plan with her?" I looked down at the blood-filled grail in front of me. "My dear son, don't you know what an extraordinary creature she is? I thought back to when I met her at the cafè. Her hand felt so warm, almost familiar.
"She's a cambion, Isn't she?" I blinked at the realization. "Ah, you're a clever one,boy. She will be the missing piece of this great puzzle once you get me out." I was quiet for a second before answering. "Yeah, about that. How exactly am I going to do that? The demon Lilith is already dead, she died centuries ago." I bit my lip, biting my lip-ring in between my teeth. "Patience, my son. I will reach out once the girl's under our control. Until then, raise a little hell for me." And with that he was gone. My dear father. Trapped in a cage in the darkest depths of Hell. He didn't deserve this. All he did was having a mind of his own. I was going to get him out, no matter the price.
