"In school they taught us to make friends. At home they taught us to not talk to strangers. In school they taught us to write pretty. At home they taught us to speak pretty. In school they taught us to not hurt others. At home they taught us to defend ourselves. In school they taught us to pay attention. At home they taught us not let words get us. In school they taught us to sit correctly. At home they taught us to walk properly. In school they taught us how the princess lives in a castle. At home they taught us to be like a princess. But what they didn't taught us was the cruelty behind reality."

I guess this is important.
