I woke up sweating and  screamed and covered my face with the pillow  and looked around  ...kylie   I thought hopping off the couch and through the house   where's Kylie  then I remebered and frowned then I ran  around the house    and   plopped down on the couch so I guess it was real  she's gone
" Hey jay "  kylie said behind me
" your not real Im just imagining you " I said softly
"  wait kylie " I yelled turning around making sure this wasn't  a dream  it was real my baby is alive and it was a dream  thank God I thought running up to her and pulling her into a hug like I really did lose her and I grabbed her face and kissed her  it scared me to think I had lost her she's my everything and I feel so bad for what I did to her but I just really missed her I'm so glad it was a  dream
" I love you soo much  don't you ever leave me "  I whispered  as tears threated to spill
" I won't "
" babe what's wrong "  she said worried
" don't worry about it "   I said taking in her scent
" I love you  baby girl promise u won't leave me " I cried
" I promise " she said  looking at me confused
" and I love you too" she whispered
"  I'll never hurt   you again  I promise you it scares the crap out of I thought I lost you  forever   I love you soo much " I said on the verge of tears
" ok justin babe dont cry"  she said wiping away my tears
" ok " I said snifling "  I just don't deserve you  you can trust me I promise " I added
" let's go some where" she smiled sticking out a hand
" ok " I said    giving her my hand
Kylie ran upstairs to get ready  and I stared up at her as she ran up the stairs that dream was so real  what if I'm dreaming now   what if it wasn't a dream and I'm dreaming now    then need to calm down it was a nightmare  I thought walking into the downstairs bathroom I then washed my face and combed through my hair  then brushed my teeth  and used mouthwash then  I felt two small arms around my waist and smiled and turned around and faced her and kissed her softly  then I  deepened the kiss and pulled her against  my body   after a few minutes of this we pulled away gasping for air   shared I love you's and   walked out the bathroom  and I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door and I locked the door behide us
" can I drive " kylie pouted
" no " i yelled wide eyed
" why not "  she whined
" because your not driving ok"  I yelled
" fine " she said crossing her arms then hopping in the drivers seat
" thank you" I said hopping in the drivers seat
Kylie put her seatbelt on and I drove off      and silent ness filled the car
" babe where do you wanna go I'll take you anywhere  any price"  I said smiling at kylie
" anything for my princess" I added smiling at her but she didn't answer me  so I stopped the car
" dammit  kylie   answer me " I yelled banging my hand on the wheel  she didn't answer me
" kylie what's your problem answer dammit "   I said
She still didn't answer   so I openedmy door and got out
