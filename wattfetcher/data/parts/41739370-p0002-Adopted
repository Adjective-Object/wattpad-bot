"Nick please don't tell me this is true," I said.
"Jess it isn't just please break up with me and forget about me," He said. I knew he was crying.
"Nick please don't do this to me, I love you Nick,  I love you," I cried.
"Jess god forget me already, you know I will do it, Jess we are over," He said then hung up. I had a million tears streaming down my face. The car came to a stop and the boys got out and I did too. Liam led me to the front of their flat and unlocked the door. I ran into it and ran to a room and locked myself in it. I didn't know or care who's room I was in.
"Jessica please come out," I heard someone I think Liam say. I cried harder.
"Jessica please," The voice said again. I wiped away and unlocked the bedroom door. It was Liam and he pulled me into a hug where I cried into his shoulder.
"It hurts so much," I cried. He rubbed my back trying to calm me down.
"I know, I know," He said in a calm voice.
"I thought things were perfect between us," I said pulling away.
"Relationships are never perfect sweetie," He said.
"Thanks Liam," I said.
"No problem Jess," He said.
"So me and the lads were thinking on going out tonight, for dinner," Liam said.
"Oh well have fun," I said.
"Jess your coming with," Liam said.
"Oh um I don't-," I began but got caught off.
"Jess like it or not, you are apart of my family, your like my daughter now, your always invited," Liam said. I just smiled.
"And I swear to god if one of the lads asks you out I will kill them," He says.
"No you wouldn't, your Liam Payne or should I say-," I began but he cut me off.
"Don't say it," He warned.
"NIALL," I yelled.
"WHAT JESS," He yelled back.
"OPEN YOUR DOOR AND LEAVE IT OPEN," I screamed.
"OK BUT WHY," He yelled.
"Daddy Direction," I told Liam and ran into Niall's room and quickly shut the door.
