Instead of waking up to the beautiful sound of my alarm I wake up the the ear piercing scream of my mom. I stand up in my rosewood dance academy shorts and my brothers old lacrosse shirt, and run over to the stairs to see what they were screaming about. The most I could get from all the way upstairs is that my mom was yelling and my brother, Carson about leaving his breakfast plates on the kitchen table, And since she had a photo shoot to go to she will not clean it up. My brother Carson is very lazy even though he is the star lacrosse player in the whole Sandy Beach High School. And Trust me he acts like the star at home and at school.
After i heard the front door close and Moms trucks engine start up.I sat on the stairs staring and my nails that were painted blue. Then seeing my dad, David Manner past me and scream down stairs, ''LINDA did you leave?" before he could even finish. I blurted ''yep''. and his neck quickly jerked down to where i was sitting. ''Hi'' i added ''Oh god, Sage Manner what did i tell you about scaring me!'' By that time i was back to staring at my nails. ''oh sorry ''. He stood up, rolling his eyes. ''Game today?'' i kindly asked. ''Yep'' he quickly snapped. Dad walked back to his room chanting ''DALLAS COWBOYS!!!!!!!''
Both of my parents are full time workers. My dad is the coach of the football team the Dallas Cowboys , and yes the Manner Family lives in Dallas, Texas and are big Cowboy fans. Dad was really upset when Carson quit football for lacrosse but several weeks no more like years he got over it. My mom, Linda, is a three time best selling author and a wedding and or special event photographer. Most of the time they bring home their need for perfection into our family life. It gets annoying when you live with it 24/7.
