Amanda's P.OV.I guess I was right, she is a whore that likes to steel another girl's man. She pissed me off, actually..... I'm more that pissed. I'M FUCKIN' FURIOUS! And why Austin out of all of the guys here? I mean like don't get me wrong, Austin is fuckin' sexy but why him? I started to think then I had a flasback.
*Flashback*
*Zach Constantly Starring At Me*
*Austin Catching Him Starring At Me And Giving Him The "Back The Fuck Off Bitch" Face*
*Becky Being Zach's Cousin*
*Zach Bringing Her To The Party All Of A Sudden*
*Becky Making Out With Austin In My Bed*
*Flashback Ends*
Then it hit me. "That little son of a bitch" I said in my head. I looked around to see if Zach was there but he wasn't so I called him. "Zach!" I yelled in a calm, soft, polite voice. He walked in, "yes?!" He questioned. "Come here please" I said pointing to a spot in front of me. He had me fuckin' furious. He walked over to me and stood right in front of me.
*SMACK*
I smacked him in the face so hard I left my hand print on his face. I had more anger in me so I just let it out.
*POW*
I kicked him in the balls, he fell on the floor, and I kneeled down next to him. "I know what your plan was and it worked on me and Austin but guess what?! I figured it out and I'm gonna save my relationship with him. I'm not the smartest person in the world but I wasn't born yesterday Bitch" I said to him. I heard some of the guys laughing at him and I saw some of them helping him up from the stair case. I went upstairs to see if Austin was there and luckily he was.
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
I looked at Austin and a tear fell from my eye. He looked up at me and I walked up to him. He got on his knees, hugged me, and started to cry. His face was in my belly and my hand was tangled in his hair. I took my hand off of his head and got on my knees. I cupped his face in my hands and looked at him dead in the eyes. A couple of tears fell from my eyes and then I just kissed him.
I broke the kiss and then he just spoke. "I'm so sorry, just listen to what I have to say" he said as tears fell from his eyes. "Ok, say what you have to say" I said to him. "I didn't come onto her, she came onto me and I tried so hard to fight her off but she fought back. I made a huge mistake by kissing her back but I reacted and tried to get her off of me and that's when she pinned my arms down. And a second right before you opened the door she moved my hands to her ass" he said as I took my hands off of his face and just sighed and looked at the ground.
"But please believe and forgive me, I'm so s-" I cut him off my placing my pointer finger on his lips and told him, "shhh.... I believe and forgive you. I know it wasn't your fault, it was a plan that Zach made Becky go along with" I say as I take my finger off of his lips. He sat on the floor and I sat on his lap facing him. He put one hand on my waist and the other one on my ass.
"You know that I love you, right?" He asked me. "Of course I know that. Those tears that I saw a few minutes ago weren't tears of happiness, they were tears of sadness. I know you don't want to hurt me" I said as I turned his face to look at me since he was looking down. "Listen to me, you are mine and only mine. I love you with all my heart, Austin. I don't know what I would do without you" I said letting a couple of tears out.
"You're my one and only Princess" he says as he cupped my face in his hands and rubbed my cheeks with his thumbs. He leaned in and kissed me. He broke it after a few seconds and spoke. "How did you know it was a plan that Zach had made?" He questioned. "Because I was think after everything had happened and then all of a sudden I had a flashback" I replied.
