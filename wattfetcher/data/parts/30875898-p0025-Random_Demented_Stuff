Scratching your way through
The tunnel is closing in
Soon you'll be stuck, amd won't be able to win
There's no way to go back
The roof has crumbled down
You can't go forward
A heavy duty fence to ensure you stay sound
Your deepest fears are coming alive
Crawling through the open holes of your every lie
Trying to get out, to get away from this place
A place called hell, that just isn't for me
Trying to run, but I can barely stand
Trying to break free from your icy cold hands
Crawling through a dark room
Blood dropping from your palms
Throns sticking in your body, stuck forever more
You see a note that says the last person who was here died
You cry out in agony as your worst fears come alive
Trying to get out, to get away from this place
This place called hell, that just isn't for me
Trying to run, but I can barely stand
Trying to break free from your icy cold hands
Just trying to get by
Just wondering why
Just trying to stay alive
We're all just trying to survive
Trying to get out, to get away from this place
A place called hell, that just isn't for me
Trying to run, when I can barely stand
Just trying to break free from your icy cold hands
