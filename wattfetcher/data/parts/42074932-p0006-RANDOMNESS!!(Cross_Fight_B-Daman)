Jane:There right there!*points at Jimmy*
Look at that tan and tinted skin.
Look at the killer shape he's in.
Look at that slightly stubly chin.
Oh please he's gay,totally gay.

Kamon:I'm not about to celebrate.
Every trait could indicate the totally straight expotraite.
This guy's not gay,I say not gay.

All:That is the elephant in the room.
Well is it relevant to assume
that a man who wears perfume
is automatically matically fay?!

Novu:But look at his quoft and crispy locks.

Sumi:Look at his silk translucent socks.

Kamon:There's the eternal paradox.
Look what were seeing.

Sumi:What are we seeing?

Kamon:Is he gay?

Jane:Of course he's gay.

Kamon:Or European?

All:Ooooooooh.
Gay or European?
It's hard to guarantee.
Is he gay or European?*stares at Simon*

Simon:Well,hey don't look at me.

Kaito:You see they bring their boys up different
in those charming foreign ports.
They play peculiar sports.

All:In shiny shirts and tidy shorts.

Sara and Sam:Gay or foreign fella?
The answer could take weeks.
They will say things like 'ciao bella'
While they kiss you on on both cheeks.

Samuru:Oh please.

Sara and Sam:Gay or European?
So many shades of gray.

Riki:Depending on the time of day,
the French go either way.
