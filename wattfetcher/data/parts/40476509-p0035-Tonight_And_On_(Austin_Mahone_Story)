Me: Well I've noticed that she's starting to eat a little bit more. She wasn't eating properly for a little bit less than a month.
Mom: Why wasn't she eating properly?
Me: Because after the car accident she didn't want at all. I forced her to eat but she would eat about 3-4 bites out of the food.
Mom: SHE GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT??!!!
Me: Yeah, she was in a coma for about 6 days. Did she not tell you? I figured she would.
Mom: No she didn't. Oh my God, my Baby was in a coma!!!! (*panicky worried voice)
Me: Why wouldn't she tell you? You're her mom, you should know these things.
Amanda: I'M BACK! (*perky, loud voice*)
She sat in the bed.
