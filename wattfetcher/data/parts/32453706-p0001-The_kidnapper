"OK mom I understand just stay out of my business please" I yelled. I walked out the house and headed for school. What i said to my mom was really how i felt she always was in my business it so agrevating, i have a father. but him and my brother are more closer. But i honestly dont care, cause i dont need extra pressure in my life. But aside from that I'm so happy this is my last year at this pathetic school I go to. So I was walking to school I felt a weird presence near me as if someone was following me, but I paid no attention to it and kept walking. Its a really long alley that I take to school, I only take it because I hate being earlier for school.
As I was walking that presence I felt grew larger and larger "is someone following me" I thought. I decided to stop and slowly turn my head behind me, then out of know where someone grabbed me from behind. I tried to scream but he put a very strong cloth up to my nose. I no longer had the strength to move nor speak, my eyes grew darker and darker until finally I blacked out.
"Am I dead" I thought. All I could see was darkness nothing more, nothing less. "It feels like I'm in a car" I thought. I slowly opened my eyes. Finally I could see, and by the looks of it, it looks like I really am in someone's car. As I tried to sit up, I noticed my hands were in cuffs. "What is this" I said. "So you've finally woke up alex" someone said. When I looked in the front of the car,and there I saw him. The man, that guy, my kidnapper.
