You see a ribbon, I see a noose
You see a tie, I see a choker tied just a bit too loose
You see scissors, You see a knife
I see tools to end my life
You see sleeping pills, You see a gun
I see a way to make sure I never see the sun
You see a hoodie, You see long sleeves
I see the perfect clothes to cover the scars on me
You see the scabs, Your mind goes to the cat
I see you stare at my wrist and I have a heart attack
You see a hospital, but I see hell
You see disgusting piercings, I see a job done well
Its self mutilation to me, can't you see
I see you, but you can't see me
You see crazy, I see crazy too
Because you can see me, and I can see you
