"Al, I am sorry to say this, I really am, but your sister has been in that car accident with your boyfriend, and I only know this because like I said, my mom just told me that bad news and she was the one who saw your sister in the hospital and it was really horrible to tell you the details so I'm not gonna bother to tell you that, and-"
"Jayden! How's my sister? Is..is she okay?" I interrupted while I turned to faced him, worried written all over my face.
I couldn't fight my tears now that I was trying desperately to hold when Jayden told me about my boyfriend, but hearing that my sister was involved was painful.
"Al, honey, I am very sorry to have to tell you this but your sister is dead" Jayden answered me slowly and softly.
I didn't know what to say, didn't know what to do. My eyes started to cloud with tears and my body started to shake.
This isn't real. This is just a dream, a nightmare perhaps. My sister is not dead, she isn't dead. She's only eighteen, too young to die. I have to wake up soon and then I'm gonna call her just to make sure that she's alive. She's not dead, I'm pretty sure of it.
So much for telling myself that my sister is not dead that I didn't realize that I'm crying so hard until my best friends wrapped their arms around me and told me that they're sorry and that everything's gonna be fine.
Even though I knew they wanted to comfort me, all I can think is that everything's not gonna be fine, now that my sister is dead.
