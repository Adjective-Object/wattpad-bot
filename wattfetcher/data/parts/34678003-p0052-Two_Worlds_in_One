After the fireworks were over Chase and I continued to lay on our backs and watch the stars. "Princess, it's getting late, we need to go to sleep to be up and ready for tomorrow." Chase said nudging my shoulder with his. I gasped and shot up so now I was sitting up. "Shit!" I immediately covered my mouth with my hand. Oh gosh I didn't not mean to say that!Chase looked shocked at first then e cracked a smile. "I never thought I'd never hear that pretty mouth of yours say that dirty word." He had this cocky little smirk and his slightly mess hair (from laying down) was all going for him. But I had no time to admire him. "I need to meet up with Anna and I need to get out of here!""What? Why?" He said with concern written all over his face. "Anna is supposed to be spending the night at my house! I need to get home!""Babe, don't worry. I'll drive into the infield. You text Anna and tell her to get Ryan to bring her to your car. It's parked in the same place it was before." Chase said getting up and then helping me up. I helped him fold the blanket up. The final fold that brought the two ends of the blanket together I kissed Chase. "Thank you! For everything." I smiled.
