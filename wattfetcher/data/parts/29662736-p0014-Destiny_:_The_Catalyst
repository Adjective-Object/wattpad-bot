So imp walking home with Dylan .he asked me again and I said yes. I liked his company. He was cool.

I was hoping you could come.

............................................
After dinner I went straight up to my room and took out the book I found.
I kept looking at the book. It was the same, nothing had happened to it since the last time. But the book is cold. Really cold.
I went to bed, and decided to just leave all this and relax my head.
And as usual my worst nightmare begins in my sleep.
the whispers....they are your guide anna. i hear while standing in dark room.
listen to the voice, find the catalyst.
what is the catalyst, i shouted back into the darkness.
the greatest weapen know to the mulit- verse.
where is the catalyst.
you already have it.
.....
With that I woke up and saw it was mid night. I got up and went to get a glass of water.
Where is the catalyst? It said that I have it already. But what.
Perhaps I can I find a book store and go through this. Maybe I can find something about this, after all books do hold old information, maybe I could do some research. Yup
I'll go down there tomorrow.
