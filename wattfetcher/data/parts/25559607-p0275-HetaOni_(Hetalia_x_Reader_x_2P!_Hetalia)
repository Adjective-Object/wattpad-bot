"Heeey! Is anyone here?!" Past Germany called out.

Past Japan cupped his chin. "They're not here. Maybe they went upstairs?"


"Sheesh, those old geezers are always going off on their own! They came here first and yet they're nowhere to be seen." Past America complained.


Past Italy looked at the others with pleading eyes. "Look, let's go back!! I told you, we can't stay here!! It was my bad! Come on, let's go back!"


Past China sighed.  "We told you you didn't have to come. If you really didn't want to, why did you-"

"I told you!! This house is dangerous!! I've seen it! we're going to be attacked by a huge monster and everyone is going to die! It's true, I'm telling you!" Past Italy warned them desperately.


Past Germany let out a laugh and shook his head. "Haha! What the hell? We are going to die? We're nations! You didn't have to follow us here if you were that scared. That's very unlike you."



"Germany..." Past Italy looked at his friend with disappointed eyes.


Past Japan tried to comfort the Italian. "You were having a siesta before the meeting, weren't you? Perhaps you are still asleep?" he suggested.



"Even you, Japan..." Past Italy took a step back, feeling a bit betrayed.


Past Russia edged closer to them and asked, "Hey, aren't we going to look for those four?"


"Russia, just shut up!! Anyway, I'll look for them! You just stay here! Don't go anywhere!!" Past Italy snapped, irritation sinking in him.


Past China flailed his long sleeves. "Italy, what's wrong with you? It's like you became a different person all of a sudden, and it's freaking me out! Where's your usual self?"


"Then you have to believe what I tell you! Especially you, Japan, don't go to the piano room, no matter what!" Past Italy told his friend.


Past Japan frowned.  "...Even if you say so...it will be easier to search for them if we split up and agree on a time to meet here again, don't you think?"
