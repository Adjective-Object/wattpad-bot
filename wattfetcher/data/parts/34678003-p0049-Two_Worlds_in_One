"I'm sorry babe, I know you probably wanted to just hang out with me tonight but I told you I'll get this everywhere I go.""Chase, it's fine, the guy was actually kinda funny! He was like 'I'm probably interrupting date night'" I said this in a crazy low voice imitating just a guy's voice in general. Chase laughed at my imitation then as we jumped around in the moon bounce we just talked about everything. From what to do this week with him and his parents being in Maryland with me then we talked about what I wanted to be after high school; a nurse. We talked about the last the future. "Taylor, are you going to senior prom this coming year?""Uh, I mean probably.""Let me take you to prom.""Chase what if we don't even talk to one another then?""I'd be the stupidest guy in the world to let you go."
