A/N:I started writing this on June 8th.Hayes' Birthday.Watch the video.The peg game is cribitch.Watch the video at the end.I wake up to pain in my right cheek.I open my eyes to see Taylor.Of course."Idiots,"I mutter."I know you are,"Taylor reply's."Whatever,"I say."Get up,"Taylor says."Why?"I whine."Plane to North Carolina,"Taylor said."I'm getting showered,"I say.I get showered and change into:Jack 96 Johnson t-shirt Sweatpants that say 'Hayes' on the buttBlack vans with black socksI quickly put my hair in a high ponytail and put a blue bow in it.I quickly pack my suitcase.I also put my my charger in my carry on and put my mac book in my carry on.I take my phone and walk into the hall with all my stuff.I get on twitter and tweet:@miagrier'Going back home:'(.Will miss Orlando I'll try to come and see y'all again if not I love each and everyone of you'.I close out of twitter and bump into someone."I'm sorry,"the guy says."No I am I was busy on twitter,"I say."Ethan Dolan,"he says."Mia Grier,"I say."So where you heading?"Ethan questions."Breakfast,"I say."Oh,"he says.''I was here for MagCon,"I say."Press Play tour,"Ethan says."We should get each others number,"I suggest.I hand him my phone and he puts his number in.Want to go to breakfast?"I ask."I guess,"Ethan says.I walk over to the elevator with all my belongings and go into the elevator.But right before the doors close Ethan walks in.I push the 'L' button for lobby"I'm gonna eat breakfast with the guys.I'll text you when I get to North Carolina,"I say."Ok,"he reply's.The doors open and I bring everything to where the guys are sitting at.I go to the line and get bacon,eggs,and pancakes.I go to the table and sit by Shawn."Long time no talk,"I say."Yeah,"he said."Wanna do something(something big I feel it happenin')as a couple when we get to North Carolina?"I ask."Let's watch a movie,cuddle,and eat,"he suggests."Did I tell you I love you?"I ask."Y'all are a couple?I'm Ethan by the way,"Ethan says."Yeah,"I say."Will someone give me a piggy back ride?"I ask."I will,"Shawn volunteers. "Nash take Shawn and I's luggage,"I instruct."Get on my back,"Shawn instructs.I do as he says and get on his back.I fall asleep because it's like 4 am.When I wake up we're at security."Take your phone out of your pockets and take off your shoes.Thank you,"this security says.I take off my vans and put my phone and my carry on in that small little basket.We get to the front and I'm last.I walk through and run to my phone and shoes.I put my vans on and put my phone in my pocket.I hop on Shawn's back and we walk to Starbucks."Flight 5678 from Orlando,Florida to Greensboro,North Carolina boards in 15 minutes.Again flight 5678 from Orlando,Florida to Greensboro,North Carolina boards in 15 minutes,"the announcement says."Mia wants Starbucks,"Shawn says."Cotton Candy Frappe?"Nash asks."Cotton Candy Frappe."I say."Y'all just had a moment.Ahhhh,"Hayes says."Ughh shut up Hayes,"Nash and I say at the same time."Ah again,"Hayes states."You are going to get punched,"Nash says seriously."I WANT STARBUCKS!"I scream earning weird stares from everybody."Getting it now,"Nash says."Finally,"I complain."Shut up your complaining,"Nash says walking away."Why would you date me if you couldn't date Shawn,"JJ says."When Nash first got accepted into MagCon I didn't know Shawn was in it."Nash came home one day and showed me pictures of you and him.I asked him if he could send it to me and he did of course.I cropped him out and he did that for almost 3 weeks and that 4th time he came home with a picture of him and Shawn.I took and sent it to me about 16 or 17 times.I also stole Shawn's number.But never texted him.But one day Nash stole my phone and texted him and Shawn texted back and I still haven't told Nash.But I still have their conversation,"I explain."Back,"Nash says."Thank you,"I say."Now get to the gate,"Nash commands."Shawn ahead.Last couple there has to buy everyone Taco Bell when we get to North Carolina,"I say loudly."Flight 5678 from Orlando,Florida to Greensboro,North Carolina is now boarding.Again flight 5678 from Orlando,Florida to Greensboro,North Carolina is now boarding,"the announcement says."1,2,3.GO!"Cam screams.Shawn runs ahead but is behind Jenna and Nash."OMG JENIFER LAWRENCE!"I shout making Nash go check."Mia thanks,"Shawn says.Nash got to the gate a few seconds after we did."You cheated,"Nash starts."Whatever,"I say taking a sip of my frappe."Stop arguing,"Taylor says."Jack G and Allie were last,"Hayes tattles.We walk over to the lady and hand her our tickets."Your Mia.You look like a fake blonde and a slut,"she says with attitude."You look like a bitch,a slut and a fucker.I guess we are speaking our minds,"I sass."How old are you?"She asks."15 almost 16,"I sass."Respect your elders,"she said."I know I read the bible.You do know I'm not fake this shit is all real,"I sass."let's go before Miss.Talks Back will make us get stuck here,"Nash says.We walk on the plane and I get the window and I buckle up.Shawn sits in the middle and buckles up.I take out my phone and take a picture of outside.I tweet:@miagrier'RT for a follow before plane takes off'.I follow as many before tweeting:@miagrier'got to turn off all devices sorry :('."Turn off all devices and put on your seat belt on.Thank you,"the pilot says.The plane takes off and we go to soar."You may now turn on all devices and now the seat belt sign is off.Thank you,"the pilot says.I take out my mac book and go to Netflix.I put on The Whispers and watch the first episode.This is drama more like horror.Then I watched the second episode.I'm going to sleep that shit is scary.I close my laptop and put it back where it was.I wake up about 15 minutes before the plane lands."Mia we land in 15 minutes,"Shawn tells me."Ok,"I say.I take out my phone and take a picture of the clouds.I then go play bike rider.If you don't know what it is it's a kid on a bike collecting gems and trying to beat people.My high score is 626,368(really it is).But to beat people you have to bee like 100,000 over your high score.I'm about to scream.I can't beat my stupid high score."Please turn of all your devices and the seat belt sign is on.Thank you,"the pilot says.I turn my phone off.The plane lands and everybody file's off the aircraft."Gilinsky.Where we going?"I question."I don't know it's the Griers' state,"he smarts."Nash.Where we going?"I ask."Mom's coming to pick us up,"he states.We walk to baggage claim.I spot my bag and run to it.When I'm coming back I start running again and someone trips me."M-M-Mia t-t-that w-w-w-was s-s-s-so f-f-f-funny,"Nash and Hayes laugh.I g outside with my luggage and run in some fans and take pics with them.I then walk outside and wait for my mom.I see her car and run to the front seat,but first put my luggage in the trunk."Mia what's wrong?"Mom asks."I fell and they laughed at me even Shawn,"I answer."I'm sorry.Public humiliation,"mom says.She texts Nash telling him that she's here."So how was it,"she asks."Had a bad date.Well other than that great,"I say."Hey mom and Mia,"Nash and Hayes say in unison."Y'all have to sit on each others lap,"mom says."Shawn you go sit with Mia,"Nash says.Shawn comes up her and I sit on his lap.The drive there consisted of everybody sleeping or on their phone.I was just staring out the window.When we get home I get my luggage and run straight to my room.I change into spandex and plug in my phone and mac book.I go downstairs and go straight to the kitchen.I make myself a PB&J sandwich.I get a paper plate and put my sandwich on it.I eat half my sandwich,but save the rest.I go to the family room and turn on the WII.I put in Just Dance 2014 and put on the song Troublemaker by Olly Murs.I finish the song and everybody comes downstairs.I go finish my sandwich and turn the WII off."Hey Mia,"Shawn says."Hey,"I reply."Why is there a fangirl in your house?"A guy with sandy brown hair asks."That's our sister,"Nash and Hayes answer."Oh,"the guy says."Well Mia this is Connor Franta,Ricky Dillon,Kian Lawley,JC Caylen,and Trevor Moran,"Nash says pointing to each one of them.I walk out back and go to the trampoline.I walk onto the trampoline and lay on my back and think.I think about what would of happened if Kylie wouldn't have died.God I miss Kylie,she was my best friend.She was there when Nash and Hayes weren't.I didn't know I was crying until my cheeks are soaked.I get off the trampoline and run to my room."MIA!"Nash yells.I keep running and go upstairs and run to the end of the hall and go in my room.I put on my pjs and go downstairs.Nash is probably worried."What was wrong?"Nash asks."Ky,"I answer."Oh,"he reply's."Want to play truth or dare?"Connor asks trying to lighten the mood."Yassss!"I shout."Connor you go first since you asked,"JC said."Mia truth or dare?"Connor asks."Dare,"I say."I dare you to walk upstairs just your hands,"Connor dares.I do it and walk downstairs on my hands too."Shawn truth or dare?"I ask."Dare,"he says."I dare you to let me tweet anything off your account,"I dare.He hands me his phone and I go on twitter and tweet:@shawnmendes'@miagrier is da best.I love her so much.@connorfranta is my best friend'."I tweeted @miagrier is da best.I love her so much.@connorfranta is my best friend,"I say."Connor truth or dare?"Shawn asks."Dare,"Connor says."I dare you to cartwheel down the street,"Shawn says.I video taped Connor trying to cartwheel down the street.OMG he is horrible at cartwheeling.I run down the street to where he is."Stop I'll do it for you,"I say."Thank you,"Connor says.I cartwheel which turns into back handsprings which finishes into a back flip."Stop making everything about you,"Connor sasses."I'm not,"I say."Yes you are.Cartwheeling then back handsprings finishing it off with a back flip,"Connor sasses."Sorry my old best friend and I were cheer leaders.I was head cheer leader she was co-leader,"I say."Old best friend?"Connor asks."She's in heaven,"I say."I'm so sorry,"Connor apologizes."Its ok,"I say."Let's go inside,"Shawn says annoyed.The game goes on and I go again."Mia truth or dare?"Carter asks."Truth,"I say."Is it true your doing a #askmiaandconnor tomorrow?"Carter asks."Sure,"I answer.Well let me catch you up.Matt had to tell his mom he got Heather pregnant.Heater had to tell her dad.Carter and Anyanah had to scream Call Me Maybe at the top of their lungs into Connors phone calling his mom.Justine had to pretend to get back with her ex-boyfriend Josh.Hayes had to try to sing and had to post it on YouTube and had to tweet to his fans about the video.Kenzi had to eat PB&J with hot sauce.Cam had to blend nutella,cookies,and ice cream then drink it.Taylor and Gissel had to go in a room for 7 minutes no they didn't do it.Jack G had to knock on my neighbors door and ask for a condom.Jack J and Ava had to make out until Connors last turn.Allie has to sleep on the trampoline.Aaron and Kayla had to jump in the pool.Nash and Jenna had to sit on each other(True fact my little brother and I sat on each others face).JC has to sleep in the front yard.Kian had to shut up for the rest of the game.Trevor had to eat baby food.Connor had to do a video{top}.Ricky had to prank call Tyler Oakley and had to sing a Miley Cyrus song.We finished the game and everybody except Connor and I go to sleep."Want to play 20 questions?"I ask."Sure,"Connor said."Full Name?"I ask."Connor Joel Franta,"he says."Mia Mackenzie Grier,"I say."Favorite You Tuber?"Connor asks."Me,"I say."Me,"Connor says."Favorite viner?"I ask."Nash or Cam,"Connor says."Literally

say."Goodnight,"Connor says."Goodnight Con da bomb,"I say.I go upstairs to my room to see Shawn sprawled across my bed."Shawn,"I whisper."Hmm,"he groans."Scooch over,"I say."Ok,"he says."Goodnight,"I say."Goodnight princess,"he says.I get in bed and he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me closer to him.God I love this boy.A/N:Finally finished this update after a full week.So pissed it took
