"We'll be taking what we came for now."
"What?!!"
"Don't worry, we won't hurt her."
"Now wait just a--"
Before England could even finish his sentence, Oliver used his magic to transport the Second Players back to their base.
---------
As the Second Players disappeared along with (Name), the First Players just stared in silence. They were the only ones in the hall now, bloody and bruised.
"What have they done...?"
The thought run through their heads, echoing in the very depths of their minds...and their conscience.
Ending their ear-ringing silence, a brown haired Italian stepped forward and faced his comrades with a cold, hard stare.
"We should go back to the saferoom." Italy told them.
Prussia creased his forehead, "But, Italy...they've got (Name)!"
"Yeah... We need to save her from those bastards!" America reasoned.
Clenching his fists, Italy shot him a glare. "The only bastardi here are you guys!" he shouted angrily.
They all stared at Italy with wide eyes and looked back and forth between him and his older brother. It was normal for them to hear Romano talk like that...but Italy... This... this has never happened before. Never in their lives would they even imagine Italy to get angry like that.
"Hai... We understand." Japan said softly. Turning to face his comrades, he spoke, "Italy's right. Let's head back to the saferoom, get our injuries checked, and talk about the matters at hand seriously."
Though hesitant at first, they nodded and started to walk.
So much had happened, they all needed to settle down and clear things out. As they walked through the halls, that one question echoed in their minds once more.
"What have they done...?"

The (h/c) haired girl tucked a lock of hair behind her ear and asked Oliver in a geniunely curious tone,
"Who's....'(Name)'...?"
----------------
The Brit couldn't help but back away from the girl. "Y-You're joking, aren't you, poppet...?" he asked hopefully.
"Uhm, sorry? I'm serious..." she replied, creasing her forehead. Turning to look at the others, she spoke, "Who are you people? What am I doing here?"
"You don't remember us at all, bella?" Flavio asked softly.
Shaking her head, she frowned. "I'm sorry...but I really can't remember anything... Even right now, I'm trying to...but my mind just draws blank about it."
"...Do you even remember who you are?" a low voice was heard from afar.
