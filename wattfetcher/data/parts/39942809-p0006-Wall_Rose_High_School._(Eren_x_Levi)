Sorry I haven't updated in forever! And sorry it's short.
~Levi~
I sit on the couch and rethink th name over and over.
MIKASA. Hmm...
I lay onto my back. I take out my phone. I find Eren's contact. God, I don't wanna text this kid. But I have to.
'Yo Eren. I need to ask you something'
'HI LEVI!! I'M SO SO SORRY ABOUT...' I stopped reading not interested in what he has to say.
'Ya ya, I don't want your shitty apology brat. Can you give me Mikasa number?'
'What? You gonna give her a talking with texting?'
'God Eren. Not everything is about you. This is just something between me and her got it?'
'Ugh fine, here's her number.' He gives me the number. Finally the at did something right.
~Eren~
Why'd Levi want her number. Maybe he wants to bitchslap her for kissing me. I wonder if her read my whole message. Thinking that he didn't breaks my heart. I read over the second last line.
'Levi I LOVE YOU. Not mikassa. Please forgive me.'
Why the hell did  I type that? He's never going to read it. And if he does.he'll just never talk.to me again. I go to the kitchen and do homework. I don't want to do it but it's the only thing that will male me forget about everything.
I finish my homework and go to bed. I pull the covers over me then turn onto my back. Why'd I convince myself I had a shot with Levi. I mean. He's Levi. The cutest damn hot boy in the whole school. Ok hate to admit that but it's true. No one even compares to him. His cold voice. His dark raven hair. It could make you forget about your whole life and the only thing you remember is that hotties face. I sigh thinking about it.
I soon slap myself. 'EREN, STOP IT! YOUR MAKING IT HARDER FOR YOURSELF. FORGET HIM!' That's harder then it sounds. But maybe I should. Besides. Maybe I could get Mikasa to be my girlfriends. 'What am I thinking? I don't like Mikasa nearly as much as I love Levi.'
Why is love so hard. Television makes it look so easy but in reality. No, it's completely different.
Eventually I talk myself to sleep. But the last thought in my brain is 'what dies he want with Mikasa's number?'
