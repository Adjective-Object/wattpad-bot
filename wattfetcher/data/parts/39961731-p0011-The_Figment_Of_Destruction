"No. Let me do it. I can do things way better than her." A Barbie named Carrie shouted.
"No. Let Charlie do it." Lily allowed.
"Yeah. I have bigger balls than you so this is easy for me. Like this." I said as I got up and went to Carrie's side. I took her face in my hands and licked her whole cheek. Her whole table looked disgusted.
"Ew!" Carrie screamed.
"I told you I got bigger balls than you." I remarked as I left the table to find Shawn. I heard more nasty remarks about me from Lily's table. "I love you, too!" I shouted at them. I made my way to Shawn's table where the boys were doing stupid things I can't explain.
"Hey, Shawn." I shouted. All the boys turned to face me.
"What do you want, Red?" Shawn harshly asked me.
"Woah. I came here to talk to you about Lily but you-"
"Lily?! Ok, ok. I'll talk to you." Shawn agreed. He got up and followed me to an empty spot in the cafeteria.
"You like Lily, don't you?" I immediately asked him. He nodded.
"I like her a lot, actually. I'd do anything for her." Shawn told me. I groaned unexpectedly.
"You sound so desperate. It sounds horrible. Don't do that." I responded. "Anyway, if you like her that much, just ask her out."
"What if she says no?"
"I'm pretty sure she won't say no."
"Are you sure?"
"Positive."
"Alright. I'll do it."
"Now."
"Now?! Hell no."
"Hell yes. Do you want her to say yes?"
"... Fuck you ..."
"I thought so. Now let's go."
We walked over to Lily's table. Lily was staring at me like I murdered someone. I can't blame her though. I tend to ruin most things.
Shawn made his way over to Lily while I kept my distance.
"Ew! She's back!" Emma called out and moved away from me.
"I swear I could slap all the makeup right off your face." I threatened.
"Like you could actually do that." Lindsey huffed and laughed.
"Watch me, Barbie." I said as I stomped my foot on the ground and stepped closer to her with my hand out. As soon as she saw me, she moved back with a scared expression written all over her face. I laughed and backed away.
"Hey, Lily." Shawn nervously greeted.
"Hey." Lily greeted back.
"I-I have something to tell you." Shawn forced out of his mouth.
"Yeah..." Lily allowed.
Shawn looked back at me and I nodded. He nodded and turned back to Lily.
"Lily... Um..." Shawn struggled with his words. He did that for about a minute until I walked up in front of him to speak for him.
I turned around to face him. "I'll take care of this." He sighed and nodded. I turned to Lily. "Ok. What Shawn was trying to say was that he really likes you. He's trying to ask you out, but he's clearly too nervous to do it himself." The cafeteria grew quiet and I found everyone staring at the three of us. "So.. What do you say Lily?"
