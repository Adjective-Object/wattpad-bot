"Oh. What are we gonna do now?" She asked.
"We are going to go find Bigfoot." Alley said. This girl I swear.
"Really!" Gali cherred happily.
"No. Stop being so gullible." I scolded her. She nodded her head and we continued our journey. I honestly had no idea where we were or how to get back. But me being me wouldn't tell them that.
"So....can we go back?" Gali asked.
"Hell no! We've only been in here for like five minutes. Alley put the damn phone away!" I yelled. Alley had her phone and was playing mindcraft fucking mindcraft! She put it away and was smiling sheepishly.
"Fine but if nothing exiting happens then im getting back on." She said. Just after she said that we all heard a twig snap.
"I. Am. Killing. You. Alley." I said as I grabbed two of my knives. Alley and Gali grabbed two of there's also.
Snap.
A branch snapped this time. A girl walked out at least I think she's human. She had jet black hair sickly pale skin and blood red eyes. Oh and did a mention freaking wings! She was wearing all black and looked bad ass!
"Run!" Gali screamed we all took off having no clue where we were going.
I was running until I was tackled down. "Ow!" I groaned. The girl from earlier was on top of me holding two black hatchets with smoke swirls carved into the handels. "Sup." I said awkwardly.
"Who are you and why are you here?" She growled. Well someone isn't very friendly. "What did you say."
"Said that out loud?"
"Yep."
"You gonna kill me?"
"Yep."
"P Sherman 42 wallaby way Sydney?"
"Ye- wait." She started to laugh with me. That just never gets old. She pulled me up and I brushed the dirt off of me. "Wow your pretty brave." She told me.
"Why thank you. I'm Arie." I said holding out my hand.
"Midnight." She said shaking my hand.
"Love the name so still gonna kill me?" I asked.
"Thanks. And nah you seem pretty cool but since you saw me I can't let you leave." She said grabbing my arm and dragging me with her,
"What about my friends?" I asked.
"There already taken care of." She told me.
"Wait killed!" I screamed.
"No idiot taken care of, my boyfriend and his friend got them." She said as we walked up to a mansion. She opened the door and I saw everycreepypasta in the living room staring at us.
"Well hya!" I said. I looked and saw Alley and Gali frozen in fear. "Hey guys meet Midnight isn't she cool?" I cheered. To be honest I forgot about all the killers in the room.
"You idiot this is your fault are you serious how are you happy!?" Alley screamed.
"I know! Look isn't this awesome! Were not dead yet! And, annndd, we can kill people." I yelled jumping up and down at the thought. I didn't notice that my hair was blowing around until Midnight pulled at it. "Ow!"
"That's so cool!" She yelled. Alley got up her hair now flying around and smacked my head.
"Focus Arie!" She said. Gali got up and hid in between us. "There not letting us leave so we have to stay here."
