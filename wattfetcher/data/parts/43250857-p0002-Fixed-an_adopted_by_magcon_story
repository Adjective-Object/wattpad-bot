'Tell me about it' I replied mouthing.
Then a boy came to inspect me.
"What's your name?" he questioned
"Bella Hart, 16, loves skateboarding." I replied instantly, knowing the usual questions.
"Fast, how did you know that?"
"Years of practice" I replied with a smirk.
"Yeah, well quit practicing." He said "I'll take her"
I squealed with excitement knowing I was getting adopted. My dream was finally coming true. I felt like a giant hose was washing away all my fears an doubts.
I jumped on him, thanking him a million times before rushing upstairs to my room. I opened the door to see Lia packing her bags also.
"You-" I started
"Uh-huh" she interrupted
"But-"
"I know"
"And-"
"And-"
Suddenly we just started squealing with excitement.
Finally, something good is happening.
