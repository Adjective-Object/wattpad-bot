"Arwyn! Arwyn! Arwyn!" my best friend Ireland exclaimed ruining my perfectly good lunch and running me over like a wild horse. I fell off my chair and landed on my butt with a thud. "God darn it! WHAT THE HECK DO YOU WANT?!" I screamed waving my hands in the air like an angry old man. "You know how your looking for a job?" she squealed. I nodded. "Yeah..." I mumbled as I eyed her suspiciously. She had that look in her eye, like the I've-done-something-very-good-or-very-bad-and-I'm-happy-about-it look. "Well... I GOT YOU A JOB AT FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZERIA!" she screamed out with all the excitement in the world holding out the news paper ad. My half smile turned to a scared frown. "Freddy F-Fazbear's Pizzeria?" I stuttered. "Didn't one of the animatronics there bite a kid's frontal lobe off?" She frowned. "Yes, but they fixed their AI and now they're all fixed up and won't kill anyone!" she said smiling at the end. I plastered a fake smile across my face. "Ok." I said through my gritted teeth taking the news paper ad. "Great!" she screamed. "Meet the owner at the pizzeria at 2:00 this afternoon. Bye!" And with that, she skipped out the door. I sat back down and looked at the news paper, it read:
Family pizzeria looking for security guard to work the night shift. 12 AM to 6 AM.Monitor cameras, ensure safety of equipment and animatronic characters.Not responsible for any injuries/dismembermentPays $120 a weekTo apply cell call: 1-800-FAZ-FAZBEAR
I swallowed thinking about the part "Not responsible for any injuries." I took a breath. I can do this, I told myself. So with that, I ate the remains of my lunch that had not fallen off my plate when Ireland ran me over onto the floor, and got ready to go meet this crazy owner.
