• Chloe •I woke a hour earlier cause I felt like it.I put my glasses on.I laid in bed and studied for one last time.We were having a big algebra test.Yada, yada, yada.I already know all of this.I finished studying and hopped in the shower.I braided my hair into pigtail braids and changed into denim shorts and a t-shirt that said 'I ❤️ Glasses' with suspenders.I put my red converse on and some mascara.I checked my iPhone.Of course no messages.I walked downstairs and saw my mom cooking."You want some oatmeal?" She asked."Sure." I said taking a seat at the table.She brought me my oatmeal as soon as my 6 year old sister Piper came running downstairs with major bed head and a teddy bear in her hand."Good morning Piper." My mom said."Fruity pebbles. This kid is hungry." She said causing me to laugh.She hopped up in the chair beside me.She was humming a song."What are you humming?" I asked."Whip nae nae." She said causing me to laugh again."How do you know that song?" I asked."Skylynn taught it to us." She said."Skylynn Grier?" I asked.She nodded her head."Not a surprise." I mumbled."What?" She asked."Nothing."Mom brought her, her fruity pebbles as soon as I finished my oatmeal."Your gonna miss the bus if you don't hurry." Mom said.She had to take Piper to school at 7:30 so I had to ride the bus she said its 'easier' that way.I ran upstairs and grabbed my bag, and Paper Towns by. John Green.I ran downstairs and said my goodbyes and walked outside.I saw the bus coming in the distance.I walked at the end of the driveway.The bus came and stopped.I climbed on and sat in seat 18/24.I sat by myself most of the time unless their was someone who couldn't find a seat.I pulled out Paper Towns and began to read.I zoned out till someone sat beside me.I looked over to see their back facing me.I ignored it and continued reading."So whatcha reading?" Someone asked me.It was Hayes. The most popular guy in our grade. Also the cutest."Why do you care?" I asked.Woah, maybe I do have some confidence."Can I not care?" He asked.I showed him the front of the book.Yeah my confidence went away quickly."I don't read a lot." He said.Okay I don't wanna have a conversation with this player.I shooshed him and began to read again.I glanced over at him.He was on his phone.He caught my glance and I quickly looked away."Hey your really good at math. Right?" He asked."I guess." I said putting my book up cause I clearly wasn't gonna be able to read."Well I need a tutor." He said."So you want me to be your tutor?" I asked."If you don't care." He said."Well I'm gonna have to check my schedule." I said as the bus stopped and I got off.I walked into the school building."Nice style." A girl said with a snicker."Thanks." I said quietly with a smile."I wore the same outfit on nerd day." She said with a laugh.I walked to my locker.I put my books in there and pulled my history book out.I walked to class and practically sat there and answered every question in class.*Lunch*I walked and sat down by myself like everyday an read my book and ate a apple."So have you checked your schedule?" Hayes said."Um yes. I only have two free days after school. The others I have math club, science club, art club, show choir, key club, drama club, and band." I said."Woah." he said."Those days are Wednesday and Saturday." I said."Works for me." he said and got up and left.
