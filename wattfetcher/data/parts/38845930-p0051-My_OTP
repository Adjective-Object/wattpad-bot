"So was I." He said.
"Aww, baby Jordan afraid of noi -- " I said before being cut off by thunder and screaming.
"Aww, baby Erin afraid of noise... and older Erin afraid of noise." He said.
"Stop it." I said.
"I love you, Erin."
We got up off the couch for dinner.
"Jordan?" I asked because he was staring at me.
"Hmm?"
"What are you doing?" I said as I chewed my food.
"I'm looking at you. What do you think I'm doing?" He asked.
"I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- what?" I asked.
"You you you you you you, what what?" He asked.
"I don't understand you." I said.
"Neither do I." He said putting his face in his hands.
"You're so cute." I giggled.
"Thank you." He said taking my hand from across the table.
My clumsy self had to spill my drink all over the table. "You idiot." I thought. "You have embarrassed yourself way too much, just say you're sorry, how much more can you say?" I asked myself. I think I got nervous... because it was with Jordan.
"Sorry, Jordan." I said after we cleaned up the drink.
"It's fine, you're cool."
"I'm sorry."
"It's fine." He chuckled.
"I'm sorry."
"Shut up." He said.
"Oh my god." I whined.
