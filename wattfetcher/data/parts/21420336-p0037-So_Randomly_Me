I am divergent, I cannot be controlled
Yeah I'm reading divergent like a badbutt
I'm in dauntless
Yeah
I'm
That
Girl
Who
Died
Jumping
Off
A
Train
And
Fell
I told u I was famous
I reincarnated though
Into a demi-dolphin
Wanna know how it happened?
*lowers voice*
Hades had a thing for dolphins...
*lowers voice even more*
If you know what I mean *wiggles Nutella eyebrows*
You heard me.
HADES
FRICKLE
FRACKLED
WITH
A
DOLPHIN
I AM THE RESULT
Conclusion: unless you want kids like me, which I'm sure your don't want, NEVER frickle frackle with a dolphin.
NEVER
So I'm thinking I'll be candor
Cuz I love sarcasm and am very curious
Or
Erudite
That works too
Not Abnegation
Never
I'm not that nice
And I'm a hyper person
Maybe dauntless
But like, I don't want to die...
I like black though!
Four sounds okay... But he's suspicious.... Very suspicious
Also I was walking around my house all day saying,"IM DIVERGENT I CANT BE CONTROLLED."
My moms like,"What?"
My response,"It's a book, you wouldn't understand *whispers* mortal."
And then my mom was talking to me about how their might be a world war three my responses varied from
"We are all gonna die."
"You are totally gonna die XD."
My sister kept freaking out she looked like she wanted to cry
._. It's not my fault I'm honest.
Oh and my mom was all like,"See this is why we don't buy u books u end up like this."
Me,"Books are amazin."
Her,"Wouldn't you rather imagine what happens in war."
Me,"That's what my pjo books are for silly."
"I meant real battles."
Me,"GASP THOSE ARE REAL HOW DARE U!"
I was terribly offended
