Japan held his katana in front of him and spoke,  "Having said that, my strength is not infinite. Going through a series of battles has been a little hard on my body."


"Thank you. If you try to argue anymore, you'll get attacked, too. Just go, quickly!" England said.


America began to feel pain in his shoulder. "Ugh..."



"America is already at his limit. I have to take care of him, not only physically but also mentally. I have to take him back quickly..." Italy thought to himself, looking at the injured American.


America tried to take a step towards the Brit. "W-wait, England, I-"


"I'm sorry, guys! I'm going now, but I'll definitely come back!" Italy interrupted. The Italian quickly dragged America and led him running towards the exit.

England waited for the two to safely leave the room. Facing his comrade, he smiled.  "Thank you for backing me up."


"I dropped the salt I was holding and had a bad feeling. The problem is this enemy. It is completely beyond my powers." Japan stated.


Nodding, England took a look at the giant creature once more. "Yeah, my magic is at it's limit, too. To honest, I wonder if the two of us can really hold it down."


"It will be difficult. However, defeat means death. If we cannot hold it down, we will be annihilated." the Japanese man said, a determined look on his face.


England raised his hands in front of him and nodded. "Yeah, let's do our best to stop it!"




And at that, their battle began.



The alien-like creature charged after them. The two island nations just dodging it by a hair's breadth. Both of them poured their strength to place damage on the the monster, be it by sword or by magic. Japan swiftly moves with his katana, while England carefully casts his spells on the Thing. One attack after the other, defending and replenishing strength...it was going on a long cycle, but it didn't seem like the monster would be giving up soon.
