Icarus is an island nation which exists solely in the Dream Realm, accessible only when one is unconscious for more than eight hours; and no I don't mean unconscious as in heavily asleep, I mean it as literally losing consciousness.
Think of it as a hidden Wonderland only few from Our World (which is such a dreary thing, full of war and vicious cycles) can enter- well, most assume it is simply just a vivid dream.Â When in actuality; it isn't. It is quite real. Icarus is a living, breathing, world- it simply operates on a different realm of existence.
Some of you might become Bonded with Dragons; although beware that they are a difficult race, considering the fact that most are descendents of Gods or Demons. Meanwhile, others might even become something not human..but beware, once that happens; you can never leave Icarus-
For Our Reality is that of science, not magic.
