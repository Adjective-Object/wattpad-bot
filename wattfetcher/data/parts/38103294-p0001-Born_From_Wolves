She was so young, so pure. The screams echoed in her ear as she watched a pack of wolves attack hers, ripping everything in their way.
Her mother made her promise she wouldn't make a sound, before she kissed her on the head and pushed her into the little crawl space locking the tiny door behind her. It was so dark, so cold. She curled into a ball burying her face into her knees silently weeping. She was so afraid she just wanted her mommy and daddy. The yells and screams were just murmurs now the walls keeping the sound out, but she couldn't get the images out of her head all the blood. She shook with disgust, oh how she wished mommy would come get her and swoop her up in her arms and kiss her all over but deep down she knew that would never happen again, deep down she knew when all of this was over she would never be the same again.
