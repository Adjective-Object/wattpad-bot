"Usually you'd go berserk."
"Its just sake, its nothing to go berserk over- oh and a towel please."
"Well, I'm just glad you're okay." Ace replied as he watched Sakura go behind the blinds.
"Can you take my uniform in my locker. The number is 551575." Sakura said drying herself. Ace dropped the clothes from over the blinds.
"You must really take care of yourself, Sakura."
"I am. I'm not the lunatic you saw 3 years ago."
"That's true."
"I'm ready let's go." Sakura said stepping out of the curtain and playing in Ace's hair before walking out.
The day went without any further incidents. Luffy only ate food and not surprisingly, he had to visit the dentist when he complained about a toothache. Then our most favourite doctor arrived.
"Hello Aya-ya." Law called, sitting at Table 16.
"Law, what are you doing here?" Aya asked with a blush still on her face. The events of the last week were still fresh in her mind. Aya reluctantly kneeled by the side of the table.
"Is t-there anything you would l-like, M-Master?" Aya stuttered.
"Aya-chan's stuttering is so~" A customer started.
"~Kawaii!" Everyone replied going chibi mode.
"Anything that isn't bread." Law answered curtly. Aya pouted before going to get her order. When she arrived, she placed the dish in front of Law much to his annoyment.
"Aya-ya. What is that."
"A slice of bread."
"Why?"
"Eat it." Aya offered.
"Hell nah."
"Yes!" Aya stated, forcing the slice down his throat. Eventually, the slice of bread went down and Law had to go for a drink of water since he's afraid that Aya'll give him water with breadcumbs in it. Aya, on the other hand, was rejoicing her new found victory.
"Was that necessary?"
"Yep."
The went on accordingly. A few Fishmen and Merfolk came to try out the café in the assurance that they won't be sold. Hence, Caimie and Shirahoshi made their début. Sir Crocdile, just for humour decided to be served by Vivi instead of Robin, which had her absolutely infuriated.
It was close to closing time and the last customers were to be seen. Vivi and Nami had already finish their shifts as the others only wanted, Aya, Robin and Sakura. Law and Ace were still there and Aya's last customer (not including Law because he waited so that he can walk Aya home.) walked in.
The whole cafe froze...literally.
A ten foot man waddled in with all his fluff and glory. Aya was tempted to go to the back to offically end the shift when an option came to mind.
"Sakura, take my shift for please?"
"I can't Aya. He's at your Table." Sakura pointed to Table 4. She hung her head in defeat and flashed a smile to Law. As she walked over to him, she tried to remember all the titles, she used  to call him.
"Good Afternoon, Young Master-sama~" Aya greeted.
"Fufufufu~ Nice to see you again, Aya-chan." Doflamingo answered. The way he said her name sent shivers down her spine and they definitely weren't the good type.
