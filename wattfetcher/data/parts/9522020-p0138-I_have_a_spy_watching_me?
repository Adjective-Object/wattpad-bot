“Okay.  I’ll see you then.”  He says and abruptly turns and leaves making me so confused.  What is it with guys?  First I see Talon doing that to Link, my sister and Skull, Chase and Jaycie, and now him with me.  Should this mean something that I totally don’t understand at this moment, but should it?  I am so confused…
"Hah, you look hilarious at this second.  I’m going to go, but before I do Thalia.  Can I tell you something?" He said catching my complete attention.
"Yes?"  I said more as a question
"You are a great person. Don't change. And, this didn't come from me but Lakyn likes you, a whole lot. He and I talked about it the other day, just to let you know." He said as he left.
I slightly felt a little hotter which was weird for me.  Maybe that’s why he made me promise.  Then that’s when I made the connection.
"Let's go and tell them Justin." I murmured. He nodded with a short chuckle.  As I ignored him I told Paul, Xander, and Mr. Everheart why everyone left and why Jaycie wasn’t here.

*Jaycie's POV*
I started to get really tired. I was lying down with Chase acting as my pillow. Morse was pacing as it's been what seems like a millennia being held in this cell. These chains were making me weaker by the second. The same results were happening with Talon. While we could stand with these I wouldn't be like Talon is. He was sagging against the wall. It seemed as though the wall was his support to stand. Morse held onto the key instead of Talon as he told them it wouldn't be safe with him. He looked so drained. My mom noticed this as well. She didn't have chains on her so she went over to him.
"Talon you should sit down." My mom said.
"No, I-I can't. I have to stay awake." He said.
"No, you need to sit down now Talon." My mom said in an authoritative voice.
He nodded knowing fighting with my mom wouldn't do anything for him. My mom hugged him like he was her own making me smile. Talon laid down putting his head on my mom’s shoulder.  She put her arm around him keeping him close. Talon fell asleep quickly as I couldn't. Chase seemed to notice this as well.
"Jay, you should try to sleep."
"I..." Before I could complete my sentence I heard a loud explosion making me cover my ears quickly sitting up. "What was that?"
"That could possibly be our way out." Morse said.
That's when I heard beeping and Chase brought some device out.
"They're getting closer. My locator is beeping. Morse take the cuffs off of them."
Morse nodded but I shook my head.
"Chase you need to do it. The people that cuff us were human or some person unaffected by silver cuffs."
He nodded as he took the key and unlocked the cuffs.
"Morse help Mrs. Everheart with Talon. I'll pick Jaycie up. They're too weak to walk. They had those cuffs on their arms and legs for over three hours. I wonder what took Skull and them forever."
"We'll find out soon. We have to escape." My mom replied.

Hey ya'll,
It's been awhile since I've done an author's not at the end.  Hasn't it?  If not well then deal with it and please read this.  Ok so about my books.  I think I am going to put My life as a Hybrid Princess needs to be reconstructed.  I will fix it as I am not liking it as much so that is going under reconstruction!  My other book that I have posted is called Hawaiian Huntress.  It may be a while for those updates along with any other updates I do.  I'm doing my best but school is kicking my ass.  Also to those of you that do not appreciate the swear words, I don't get comments on it so I guess a lot of you guys don't really mind, but those of you that do, I'm sorry.  While I could use other words and or phrases it's what it is.  If you don't like it by all means comment.
