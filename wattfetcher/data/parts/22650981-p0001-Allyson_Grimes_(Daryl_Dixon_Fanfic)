Hi, I'm Allyson Grimes but everyone calls me Ally. I am 23 years old, in college and still living with my parents. I know what your thinking. I do have an apartment but I have to baby sit my little bro on week days, so I really only live there on the weekends.
I have brownish red hair that's a little wavy. I have ocean blue eyes. My favorite color is red and I am at a height of 5'8".
My dad taught me how to shoot when I was 13 and how to use a knife at 10. I've been more into Swords and knives then I have been in guns and stuff like that. My uncle Shane bought me an AK47 for my 18 the birthday, which my mother greatly disapproved of, and my dad got me Dual Wielding Ninga Swords.
I am very outgoing and protective over my family and friends. I can be a bitch when you really piss me off and a sweet heart when its a good day.
Lori and Rick Grimes are my parents and Carl is my baby brother that I tease everyday. I would do anything for them even if it means me dying.
Oh! Gotta go! Class is starting, Bye!
