"I'm fine."

"Nee-chan." Sayo said. Everyone turned around to see her. "The ceremony is starting now."

"Ah, thank you Sayo-nee." Millie answered. Sayo smiled before turning around and walking to the altar.

"I still don't wanna be Queen." Millie said with a cute poker face.

"Oh  for fucking Kami's sake. GET YOUR FURRY ASS DOWN THERE TO PERFORM  THAT  FUCKING CEREMONY SO THAT WE CAN GET PAID  AND GO TO OUR FUCKING-ASS WARM DORM!"

"SHUT UP!" Sakura and Aya yelled giving Haruka 5 punches each.

"Oh my." Twilight chuckled.

"This is bloomlily, Princess Twilight is walking up the stairs to the altar."
"Fucking idiot, we can all see that."
"Haruka, that's a slap."

"By the way, my code name is BananaNinja."
"Whatever."
"Bloomlily, have a better attitude."

"How can I when your freaking codename is AngelPFU."

N.b- PFU mean Pink Fluffy  Unicorn.

The trio of friends  were hiding in the hallway above the Cathedral. They were to look for  any suspicious activity among the guests or just any suspicious activity  at all.

So  far, the coronation was going fine. The pope, who for some reason  looked like he was a mug of boot beer, was continuing with the  ceremony  as purposed.

Haruka's eyes lazily explored the crowds until he landed on him. He  was wearing his formal attire, a black shirt, pants with a red stash  over the black shirt. His black spiky hair stood out and Haruka wanted to  punch something until he saw a shadow dart form one of the rooms.

"Bloomlily, suspicious activity in your area, AngelPFU be read for anything.

"Hai."

Sakura walked around the bend and ended up seeing a bunch of doors. She sighed.

"That  demon has gone crazy now." Sakura muttered to herself before starting  to walk away. Then she heard the sound of a gun loading.

She walked in the direction where she thought she heard the sound when she someone whisper,"Fuck these stupid guns."

Yes, it was a quiet whisper.
