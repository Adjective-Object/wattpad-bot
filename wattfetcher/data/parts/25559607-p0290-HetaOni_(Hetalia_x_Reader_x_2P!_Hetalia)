"....They look lovely and well-made....but....is it alright if I pass?" I answered him nervously.

Raising an eyebrow, the strawberry blonde haired Brit spoke "Hmm?~ Why, poppet? They're delicious, I tell you."


"Just pick one. He'll kill you if you deny." Matthieu told me bluntly.


I froze. What? No! I can't pick one!.... I know what he does to his cupcakes...
What the heck?! Were they actually going to kill me, after all?


Biting my lip, I spoke softly, "...I'm...sure the cupcakes are delicious."


"Then take one, poppet!" Oliver growled, no longer asking--but ordering.
I stood up and took a step away from him. "I'm sorry, but I can't!"


"And why not?!" Oliver stood up, as well, glaring at me.


Without thinking, I replied, "Because both of them have poison!!"


"Heh. Well well well. This is getting interesting." I heard Allen chuckle beside me.

The pink swirls in Oliver's eyes slowly disappeared as he placed the cupcake tray on the table. "....Poison...." he turned to face me. "......How did you know about that?"


All eyes were on me now, as they were also somehow alarmed by the fact that I knew that there was poison inside perfectly normal looking cupcakes. How am supposed to explain that?!


"C'mon, (Name), don't dig your grave any deeper than it already is." I thought to myself, staring at the floor.


Looking up to face them, I spoke,


"...I'm not from this world."




"Idiot." I mentally facepalmed.
