"I know you!" Milo said, and my attention snapped to him. "You're Lachance! I know all you guys! And all your fathers are going to get a call from me." He paused, "except for the Loony up in Togus." Yup, men are immature.
My breath caught, I knew exactly who Milo was talking to and about.
Teddy lost it.
"I'M GONNA KILL YOU YOU SONOVABITCH!"
Chris and I in sync, grabbed Teddy by his arms and pulled him away. We could still hear Milo's cries of "Come back here!" over Teddy's sobs of "He ranked my old man!" I wasn't sure which one was worse, as we hauled ourselves out from Milo's view as quickly as possible.
Later, as Teddy finished sobbing (which I don't know why he cared about his father so much who almost killed him), we tried to comfort the boy, but he told us to and here I quote, "Just forget it!"
We did...sort of.
