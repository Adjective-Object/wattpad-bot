As soon as I ran upstairs I played along with them for my plan was to escape I told Ethan "I'm going for a bath and I need my privacy!" He replied "ok" I then ran up the mansionous house and locked the door behind us.
I then saw the car keys on the counter in the bathroom and his bed was in a mess it was untidy and my top was on the floor my heel was literally inside his high tops and his shirt and jeans were on the bed as well.
I remembered they memory
I then grabbed the car keys,went downstairs say by him and awaited night to fall.
