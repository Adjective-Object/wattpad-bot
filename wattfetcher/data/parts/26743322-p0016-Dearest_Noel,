dearest noel,
i got home exhausted. tired. breaking down in tears.
everything was too much noel. i couldn't control the voices inside my head.
i couldn't control anything anymore.
i just wanted to die.
i burst through the door and everything changed in that moment.
my world stopped spinning.
my heart stopped beating.
my mouth went dry.
i was speechless.
i couldn't move for a second or two.
there she was noel.
my mom.
she was laying on the kitchen floor.
i ran towards. the hot tears gushing out of my eyes.
i screamed out her name as i shook her trying to wake her.
a part of me kept hoping that she somehow thought she would nap here.
but that was ridiculous.
i put my head against her chest and listened.
there was no
heartbeat.
