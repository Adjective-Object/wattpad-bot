When I arrive at the gym Eric is at the front waiting for me. He greets me with a small smile as we walk inside.
"You sure look like you came to work out" Eric smirks as he walks over to some weights.
"Well I would look weird if I wore jeans and a shirt to a gym" I shrug my shoulders and lay back on a bench press thing, I think.
"So have you heard from your sister lately?''Eric asks, his veins popping out of his arms as he lifts the weight.
"Not really. With Rose she's pretty busy" I sigh and roll over so im laying on my stomach. Rose is my niece she's only a few months old and already a handful. My sister doing everything on her own is also a struggle. I help Penelope, my sister, as much as I can but I do have thing I have to do.
I look over at Eric but immediatley look over his shoulder as I see a familar mop of curls. Harry is here. Why is he here? He's a boxer, he obviously works out idiot. Before I can look away his eyes connect with mine. A smirk appears on his handsome face as he starts walking towards me.
