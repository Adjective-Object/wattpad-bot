Andrea ditched all her plans for the rest of the day. She couldn't carry them out; she had Jenn.
For most of the day, Lauren and Arden were planning their New Years party. Jenn and Andrea had no part in it, and quite frankly were too busy cuddling on the couch to help anyways. "Would it be too awkward to invite Kalin?" Lauren asked, whispering. Arden shook her head. "What about your ex?"
Arden raised an eyebrow. "That's... yeah, it would be." A bulb lit in the matchmaker's head. "Could I invite someone you probably don't know?"
"Depends who," Lauren said, shrugging.
Her roommate hummed while looking at the contacts in her phone. She stopped on one boy in particular. "Have I ever told you about Denis?" Lauren shook her head. Arden immediately started squealing. "He's definitely coming."
"Alright, dude. I hope he's not a fuckboy," Lauren said. Arden chuckled, telling herself she would once again prove herself an amazing matchmaker.
