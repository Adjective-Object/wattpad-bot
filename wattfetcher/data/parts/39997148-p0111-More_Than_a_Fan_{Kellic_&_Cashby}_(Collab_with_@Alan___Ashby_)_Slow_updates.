He didn't say anything back to me so I just started playing video games instead.
"Alright, I think I'm ready." Kellin said an hour later as he skipped to the lounge.
"You really got ready for a whole hour?" I asked turning the game off.
"Yes I did. Is there a problem?"
"No, no. No problem."
"Good, now let's go." He said and I stood up throwing the controller down.
"Lets go." I said taking his hand and pulling him off the bus.
"So what are we doing?" He asked swinging our hands between us.
"Well first we're going to go get lunch and don't worry about the rest of it."
"Alrighty."
"So did you get that grade brought up?" I asked him.
"Yes, finally I have an A now and I'm so relieved."
"That's great baby! Does that mean your parents are off your case about it all?"
"Hell yeah, well in a sense."
"In a sense? Are they still bugging you? Do I need to talk to them?"
"No they're just making sure things stay where they're meant to be."
"Okay well I don't want you stressing out over anything." I told him kissing his cheek.
"I'm always stressing about it though. You can't stop me."
"I know but I don't like it. That's why today you are just going to relax got it?"
"Relax, that's my middle name."
"You said it yourself babe, you're always stressing."
"Then stress is my middle name."
"And you're going to relax,"
"I am going to relax. I know that."
"Good because this is going to be so much fun but I need to feed you first."
"Food sounds amazing. I'm starving."
"Alright well I saw this little diner when we drove through so let's go there."
"Sounds perfect to me."
"Good now come on." I said and started dragging him down the street.
"Okay, okay no need to man handle me."
"Sorry." I muttered and let go, "I'm just really fucking excited."
"So am I."
"Good." I said and we finally made it to the diner and I opened the door for him.
"Thank you."
"You're welcome babe."
We walked in and went to a table sitting down together.
A waitress quickly came by and took our order before leaving just as fast.
"So what made you ask me out on a date in the middle of the day.... on a Tuesday?" Kellin asked grabbing my hands.
"I thought why the hell not. We haven't been on one and why not make a Tuesday special."
"Okay then." He said and giggled a little, "Maybe Tuesdays can be our date days."
"Date night Tuesday? I can do that."
