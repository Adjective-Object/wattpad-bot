After brutally punishing and leaving his pack, werewolf Conall takes up residence in New York City, where he is met with the struggles of being a monster in a highly populated area and an enigma who he dubs the name Luna. As he grows used to the close quarters of the city, Conall finds himself constantly taken with this mystery of a girl, who not only holds the beauty of the moon but smells too much like his kind to only be human. With the phenomenon of Luna to interest him, Conall begins to like his home in the city, and only one thing threatens it: a struggling pack is in need of power, and they'll do anything to get him back.

Author's Note:
Conall is rated PG-13 for its violence and GRAPHIC content (seriously, I cringed while writing some parts).
Conall is the third installment in my werewolf project.  The order of the three stories is: Jonah, Jacqueline, and Conall.
Thank you for your time and for reading.
