I sat on a table with my friends and started eating and laughing, "WHERE IS SHE?" Everybody heard Conor shouting, "The girl who insulted my girlfriend, "Guess he's looking for me" I said to my friends, "Stay down" Hangar said, "He's really angry" Helen put her bag over my head to cover me, I chuckled, "Come on ! I'm not the one that hides" I said then stood up, "What do you want from her" Simon bumped into Conor, "Stay away Simon, it's non of your business" I said and walked to them, "Oh, I see the love birds aint good" Connor commented, "Oh, please shut up" I said, "Don't deny it, we all saw the romantic hug yesterday" Connor smirked, "And I thought you had a brain ! If a guy is nice you call it love. What do you want?" I sighed, "Your heart out of your body" He took a step closer but he was pulled away by Tom, "Grow up, you're not going to hit a girl" Tom said, "We can beat the hell out of you" Damon told Connor, "Is that a fight ? I want to join" Peter came and stood beside Tom and Damon, "This is going to turn into a huge fight" Diana said, "He wants to fight, let him go, I'll deal with him" I said, "Listen to me Conor, it's a thing between girls, don't get into it, I didn't come to fight but I'll defend myself", "Show me what you got" He clenched his fists, I stood still until he was about to punch me, I caught his fist then jumped over him, Alhamdulillah I always wear pants under skirts then put both of his hands behind his back, I used my leg to trip him and he fell on his back, "LEENA AND CONOR ! TO MY OFFICE" And that was the wake up call, the principal. "Astaghferollah" I sighed and followed him to hos office with Connor limping behind me, "WHAT'S GOING ON NOW ? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TO YOU TOO? THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I CATCH YOU FIGHT ING", "You always come late and never find out what actually happened" Conor said, "Enough ! Don't need any explanation, you two, detention for a month after school, if I see another fight, you're out of this school, OUT" He shouted and I Conor got out first, "Wait a second Leena", "Yes?"I frowned, "I'm not fine at all with what I've seen, BUT, I'm impressed with your abilities, and more impressed because you are courage enough to face Conor 'the beast of this school' so, I'm offering you a free membership to join our karate team, we're preparing the team for the national competition, and I believe that you'll be our winning card" WHAT ! "Are you serious ?" I asked with my eyes wide open, "100%, and dont go to detention, my favourite student shouldn't pay for defending herself, but keep it a secret for now, don't want them to know that I'm going easy with you" He smiled, "THANK YOU" I walked out with a huge smile on my face,  but it faded when I remembered that I had a math test and I was late for the class, I apologised for being late then I answered all the math questions easily.
"Just please let's get back the way we were, just friends like before, I don't want anything more, I swear I wont cross the lines and will control my emotions, just give me one chance" Simon said but I ignored him and got into my car  and headed to my work, Simon followed me in his car, I reached the mall and got into the place I work in, "Just listen to me !" He said then my phone started ringing, I took it out and answered, "What do you want Damon?", "You should get home", "Why ? What happened ?" I his voice was hiding worry, "Just come quickly, it's serious" He said, "I'm working now", "This is more important, you should come and hear what I have to say", "You better not be kidding me, because if you were, I'll make you pay me instead of the money that my boss will take away", "JUST COME QUICKLY" I hung up the phone and hopped in my car.
