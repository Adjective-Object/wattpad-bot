"It's me."
"What?"

Heya! Here it is! MFCPC's prologue done! So the thing is it's short and weird. I know haha. Well I'm working on it. Anyways, sorry for the typos and weird grammars. Sneak peak of chapter 1? You got it!
Chapter 1: I'm not short! You're just tall!
"And of course there's me! The handsomest, most good looking person you'll ever meet." I said proudly.
"And probably the proudest and the biggest sarcastic person ever!" She said while laughing.
I gave her a glare and took her iPad. I raised it up high so she won't get it.
"Hey! No fair! Put it down!"
"Not my fault you're incredibly short!"
"I'm not short! You're just tall!" she yelled.
Then she jumped on me and choked me, it didn't hurt but it sure did tickle!
"Geez! You're cute but a psycho!" I yelled back.
