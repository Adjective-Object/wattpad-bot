*FLASHBACK OVER*
"Dude, did you hear me?" Luke asks, poking at Michael's cheek.
He blinks twice and answers, "Sorry man, no I dozed off for a sec. What did you say?"
"I said, where do you think she is now?"
Michael yawns and stretches his legs. "I would assume she's back at home with my parents...where I left her."
Luke eyes his friend skeptically before putting his headphones back in.
Michael bits his lip and looks at the picture again. This time, a faint smile forms on his face when he stares at her. Lacey Williams. His first best friend and his first real love.
