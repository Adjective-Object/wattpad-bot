My day was sooooooo shitty omg I was so distant thinking about everything and my best friend Michaela was trying to get my attention but there was something on my mind bugging me and I wouldn't tell her well I wouldn't tell anyone because I felt it was stupid but yet still it hurted so much!!!!!. So I basically walked around the school with a sad face all day which is like weird for everyone because I'm always smiling and cheering up everyone so everyone was like looking at me asking me what's the matter and I just said nothing I'm fine because saying that has always been easier than explain why Im sad. And me being sad doesn't even make sence because I knew it was coming but It still hurts like bitch....
