Troyian's POV:
"Go Dacobson Ducks!" I cheered out onto the field of football players.
Yes I am cheerleader, it's actually quite fun.
And it's great exersize!
"Hey Troyian, when is our next practice?" Brittany asked in her braty little voice.
"Tomorrow after school. Like always." I told her.
I turned my head back towards the feild and saw Sam running with the ball.
The wind blowing through his perfectly golden hair.
His tanned skin slightly glistening because of the sweat.
His green eyes dark and determined.
The buzzer went of and he threw the ball to the ground with an agrivated grunt.
I ran over to him and hugged him.
"It's okay babe. You did great!" I cheered.
He looked at me and pushed me aside.
"Sam! Wait!" I yelled after him.
I chased him down and jumped on his back.
"Troyian. This isn't the time for happiness. You know how mad I get when we lose." He growled
"Maybe I can help?" I smiled as I walked to the front of him and kissed him in front of the whole crowd.
Aww's were heard but he still didn't kiss back.
I pulled away and looked at him.
He glared back so I stomped away.
He knew not to mess with me when I'm angry.
So he pushed his way through the crowd of cheerleaders, grabbed me by my waist, lifted me up and kissed me once again.
Once again the aww's were heard.
When I kissed Sam I felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest.
He really is my one true love.
No one else, just him.
After he pulled away I began my routine.
We did a few cartwheels and few flips, blah blah blah.
Whatever.
And done!
I smiled at the crowd and not because I just executed the routine perfectly but because I now get to go home and sleep.
In my bed.
In my beautiful white room that was covered in band posters.
By band posters I don't mean One Direction or 5SOS.
I mean real bands like Peirce The Veil, Bring Me The Horizon, The Amity Affliction and other bands like that.
Weird right? A preppy girl like me listening to metal!
Well I don't think it's weird but everyone else does.
So I pretend to like all those sh*tty pop artists just to maintain my reputation.
"Omg we so should have won!" One of my team mates screeched.
"Yeah like seriously!" Another spoke
"Well we didn't win so next time we have to try even harder and be even more enthusiastic! Okay!" I called into the locker room.
"Okay!" They all cheered back.
