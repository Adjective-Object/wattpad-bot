"Niall," I did the same.
"So what's up? What happened?" He sat on the bed next to me.
"Zayn got mad it me. He was laughing and then all the sudden got pissed when I asked a question. I saw the Harry in him," I frowned.
"What was the question?"
"Who was the person him and Harry were arguing about,"
"Oh," he nodded in understanding, "Zayn's usually not the guy to get mad so quickly, but maybe something that you said made him furious?"
"I'm not really sure.." I fiddled with my fingers and Niall hummed.
"I'll talk to Zayn tomorrow, okay? I'm going to go back to the party for a few more hours since it's only 10:26," he patted my back.
I smiled at the gesture and said, "Okay. I'm gonna get some rest."
"Good," We exchanged a quick hug, "See you later Lennon."
"Bye Niall," I said before he left the room.
Even though I can't stand the kid, something dragged me back to Harry's room. I removed the party clothing and without thinking, pulled one of his black shirts over my head. It covered my bum so I decided not to put pants on and just stick with underwear.
Before I knew it, the room went to black and all my thoughts turned into dreams.
---
I could hear a faint boasting in my dreams. Though, it wasn't a dream, it was reality. The voices were coming from the living room. I checked the time.
Three in the morning.
My feet dragged me outside the bedroom door and I peeked over the corner. On the couch sat Niall, Harry, and Zayn.
"You two need to get your shit together," Niall spoke, glaring at the two boys. I couldn't tell who was drunk and who was not.
"I didn't start the damn fight," Zayn huffed.
"Well, yeah I fucking did. So what? Zayn was asking for it," Harry shrugged it off like it was nothing.
"I wasn't asking for crap. All I did was hang with Lennon. Who cares? You're the one who isn't making a damn move. You practically put it all on yourself," Zayn rolled his eyes on annoyance.
Harry stayed silent so Niall spoke again, "He's right. You treat the poor girl like trash. If you like her so much, you would actually try to be humane."
"You know how I don't handle feelings well. Damn well you all know that's true," he growled.
"Then learn to control them," Niall pointed out the obvious.
So he does like me. That's new.
I backed up into the wall, hitting a painting on it way too hard. It fell on the floor making the loudest sound possible. Great.
"Lennon.." Harry gritted through his teeth and the other two guys stared at me in utter shock.
Shit..
Short chapter. I know. I'll make it longer next time. I promise. Sorryyy guysss!
