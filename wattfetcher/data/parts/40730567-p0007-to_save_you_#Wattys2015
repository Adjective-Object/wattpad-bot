He let out a soft chuckle despite himself. He felt okay today. He has felt okay since the mystery girl started sending him those messages. It wasn't as good as being happy. But how happy was happy? Maybe happy wasn't as happy as it looked? Maybe all the "happy" people in reality, were people who over time, became really good at hiding their sadness behind a smile. But Jake wasn't one of those people. Everyone thought that the cause of his sadness was the accident. But that wasn't the case at all. He was mad at the things that led up to it, and the consequences that followed. He noticed the girl beside him staring. When he turned to look, she smiled and went back to doing whatever she was, on her phone. Maybe... no. That couldn't be true, they didn't even talk. Ever. Just then, his phone buzzed.

He looked over at the girl sitting beside him again. Her name was Hannah, and she was very pretty and quiet. Was she the person who texted him every day? But he couldn't be too sure, because almost everyone in the class was on their phones. Mr. Victor was a pretty chill teacher, and when he told to work on the assignment, it was like free time in the class.

He noticed this every time, that whenever he asked her a question, she would dodge it. Like she didn't want him to find out who she was.
Well duh Jake, or why would she send you an anonymous message.
Jake nodded. To himself. But then as soon as he realized that he probably looked like a freaking retard nodding his head for no reason, he stopped. He looked at Hannah once again, and she had earbuds in. she was really into whatever she was doing on her phone.
