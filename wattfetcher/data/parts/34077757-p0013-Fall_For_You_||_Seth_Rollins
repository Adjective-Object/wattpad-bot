Dani's POV     Today I have a date with Colby. And let me just say that, I CANT FUCKING WAIT! We are going to the movies. The Bella's are helping me get ready.     \\\_||\\\-AN HOUR LATER///_||||     Colby just picked me up and now we are in his car going to the movie theater. It's kinda a weird silence. But I have no problem with it. Colby keeps looking at me and smiling. His smile is amazing. I could just watch him smile any day, all f*cking day.
Once we pulled up, he got out and ran to my side and open the door for me. Awwww he's so cute😍.
Seth's POV      We walked inside and got in line for our tickets. Once we got them we got our snack and went to find the seats. We picked the ones in the way back.     ¥¥••AFTER THE MOVIE BECAUSE I SUCK••¥¥
When I walked her back to her room in the hotel I told her how good she looked and all that. And then I kissed her....
