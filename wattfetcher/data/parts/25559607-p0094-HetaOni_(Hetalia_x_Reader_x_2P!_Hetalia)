"Heheh. Ragazza, do you really want to go through this, again? That cupcake-loving idiota told me about our 'own names' as as you say, 'Second Players'..."
"...L-Let me go....Luciano."
"Oooh. Luciano, hmm? It's got a nice ring to it."
"Yeah yeah...now...let me go already!"
"Well well, ragazza. England may have been all nice to you and let you off just like that before..."
He lifted my chin to my side and made me face him.
"But I'm not nice like him."
"N-No...Just--Just leave me alone...leave us alone...I don't want them to get hurt. I don't want you to kill them. So please...."
"Look at you, looking out for your dear 'Hetalia characters'..."
"H-How much..do you guys kn-know?"
"We know just enough. We also...have just enough."
"...have..?"
"Si~ We have just enough to get you to join us! Don't worry, we'll welcome you with open arms."
"I don't get what you're trying to say....but I know I'll never join you guys ever--"
"Are you sure about that? Huh. I can't believe what a horrible person you are."
"W-What?! I'm the horrible person?! You guys are th--"
"Oh sure. Go ahead. Make sure your new friends are safe and sound. I'm sure (Father's Name) and (Mother's Name) won't mind getting a few cuts in their throats or whatnot~"

"No...No....you're... kidding...."
"Am I, _____?"
I clenched my fists until I felt like my knuckles all turned white.
I'm sorry.
".....Alright....you win....what do you guys need from me...?"
"Well finally!~ We'll talk about that later. For now, let me tell you how irritated I am at you for being so stubborn. If you would've just agreed immediately, we could've gotten along sooner, ragazza."
"It's because you guys play dirty."
"Hmm? I don't like your tone. Why don't I teach you lesson number one?"
"Wha--"
Suddenly, I felt a sharp blade pierce my skin.
