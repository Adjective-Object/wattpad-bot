Finally, with only three minutes left, Luffy and Sakura turned Kid's face in a doodle canvas. Pictures of cake, pie, some graffiti, animals, a label saying 'red-ass-head' and some whiskers here and there. The prank was successful until Kid woke up.
When Kid woke up, he saw Sakura and Luffy hi-fiving each other, he looked around and saw the others trying to stifle a laugh even Killer was near breaking point. The most serious Crocodile was holding back a laugh.

"What the hell is going on?"
"~nya!"
Then the whole room burst into laughter. Kid just stood there, not geeting the joke that was, until Aya provided a mirror and Kid's expression was just gold at least to Sakura it was.
"Mugiwara! I'll kill you!"
"But Sakura helped too!" Luffy whined.
"Baka!" Sakura shouted choking Luffy again, "Keep your damn mouth shut." All words were lost when Luffy tackled Sakura to the ground.
"You idiot!" Sakura shouted noticing that was was a dagger, a very sharp dagger stuck in the wall.

Slowly, she turned to the door and began turning the doorknob.
"You're not allowed to leave the room, Sky Maiden." Crocodile stated, looking at the teen.
"But if I stay here, Kid will try to kill me!"
"That's not my problem."

That's not his problem?

"Oi Saki-chan, duck now!" Luffy shouted but the words went unheard by Sakura.  Ace looked at the way her fists tightened.
"Sir Croc, what time do they let off?"
"AT noon."
"It's noon now!"
"Ace-sama, is trying to rescue us from the horrible red-ass."
"What'd ya say?!"
"It is noon. Aya, Sakura and Haruka you're free to go." Crocodile said, after checking his watch.
"Don't worry, your secret is safe with me." Ace whispered into Sakura's ears.
"Thank you."

"Come on, let's go!" Aya exclaimed, pulling Sakura towards the door. Hara just calmly walked towards the door.
"So what are y'all doing?"
"Infirmary."
"Caferteria."
"Okay, I'm heading back to the dorms. I need sleep." Sakura stated. The three friends went their separate ways.

"That's right." Sakura thought, thinking of today's events."My secret is safe with him."
