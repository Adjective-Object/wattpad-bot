I don't want to sound like a whiny attention whore, but I apologize if I do. I feel so distant from everyone else, and I try to be as good a friend as I can be, but I don't think it's working. I don't have many friends. The friends that I had deleted, or just stopped talking to me. Some are just never on. And I know I don't talk to people, but that's because I don't want to be a bother, or be pushy. I'm pretty shy, so making friends was never easy. I just feel like I don't belong. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
Sorry if I sound like an attention whore.... I just needed to get this out.
