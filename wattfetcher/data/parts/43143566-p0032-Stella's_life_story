i got interupted by moher screaming,"KRIS,BRUSH!"i groaned,"KAY!"i yelled.
my eye twitched when she yelled out again,"KRIS!"my hand clenched in a fist,"O.KAY!i shook my head heading the bathroom and brushing my teeth.
coming back in the room i drapped the blanket over my body before drifting asleep listening to my music.
