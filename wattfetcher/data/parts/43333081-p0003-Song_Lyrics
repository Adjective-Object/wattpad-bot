Loving can hurtLoving can hurt sometimesBut it's the only thingThat I know
And when it gets hardYou know it can get hard sometimesIt is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photographWe make these memories for ourselvesWhere our eyes are never closingHearts are never brokenAnd time's forever frozen still
So you can keep meInside the pocketOf your ripped jeansHoldin' me closerTil our eyes meetYou won't ever be aloneWait for me to come home
Loving can healLoving can mend your soulAnd is the only thingThat I know (know)I swear it will get easierRemember that with every piece of yaAnd it's the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photographWe make these memories for ourselvesWhere our eyes are never closingOur hearts were never brokenAnd times forever frozen still
So you can keep meInside the pocketOf your ripped jeansHoldin' me closerTill our eyes meetYou won't ever be alone
And if you hurt meWell that's ok baby only words bleedInside these pages you just hold meAnd I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come homeWait for me to come homeWait for me to come homeWait for me to come home
Oh you can fit meInside the necklace you got when you were 16Next to your heartbeatWhere I should beKeep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt meWell that's ok baby only words bleedInside these pages you just hold meAnd I won't ever let you go
When I'm awayI will remember how you kissed meUnder the lamppostBack on 6th streetHearing you whisper through the phoneWait for me to come home.
