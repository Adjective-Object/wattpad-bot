Mandy's P.O.V.
I wake up to the bright morning sun on my face. I sit up and the blanket falls off of me. And I look down What the fuck! I'm completely naked and my downstairs hurts like hell. I lost my virginity.My mom is going to kill me. Which is not my biggest problem right now cause I still have no idea where I am or who I slept with. I literally remember nothing from last night. And have a monster headache. I get out of the bed and pick my cloths up from the ground and put them on. I open up the door and here some one talking down stairs. While looking over the railing I notice that the down stairs is a mess and the television is playing the film Titanic. Did I sleep with a guy that has a thing for romance films. Hopefully he is one of the few guys who aren't jerks in my school. That would be a miracle. I smell waffles. yum. I also here a lot of guys. While walking down the stairs not really paying attention. I walk into a chest and here a chuckle come from guy it belonged to. "Oh, hey Jaycee." Shit. It's Jc Caylen he's one of the biggest jerks in my school. Oh you may think. ' But Jc Caylen is one of the most famous YouTubers in the world it would be awesome to go to school with him everyday. No That's no true at all. "Hi JC" I reply not as angrily as I had hoped. please God don't let him be the one I slept with. "So, your the chick that Kian fucked last night." I stare at him with wide eyes. "Did you say Kian is the one I slept with..." This is just great note the sarcasm. I had slept with Kian Lawley the guy I've had a crush on since 5 grade. "Yeah that's what I said why is it such a bad thing haven't you liked him since like elementary or something. I figured you would be jumping with joy." no that's the exact opposite of what I feel this is not good at all. Cause he is a dick but I still like him." Um... well do you know where he is." I say. "I need to talk to him". "Yeah he's in the kitchen. it's just down the hall and to the right.." he said as he pointed to the hall to the left of the stair case. "Thanks I guess... see ya at school Monday." " K don't be getting it on, on the counters I just cleaned them." he said with a smirk making my face as red as a tomato. "Dick.." I muttered as he walked away. _________________________________Once I found the kitchen by the way the house is huge I went to talk to Kian. He turned around once he heard me open the kitchen door. " Hey, Jaycee did you sleep well, not that we got much anyway." he said with a smirk. which did not amuse me at all. "That's not funny and I need to ask a very serious question." I said nervously " Go right ahead " he replied "Did we um... you know use protection" his face got as pale as a sheet of paper." Shit um no not really ah.. fuck" he slammed his fists on the counter. "How could you forget, Kian. I could be pregnant." I scream tearing up.Ricky ran in. "what happened is everything alright" "Um not really me and this idiot had sex and he didn't use a fucking condom." I yelled. "Kian what the hell is wrong with you how could you forget to use a fucking condom." he looked really mad " you aren't able to support a kid we are only teens" he screamed " Look I was drunk and so was she. by the way we don't even know if Jaycees pregnant or not." I was already shaking and freaking out. "Kian..." I said shakily " can you go out and buy 4 pregnancy tests." he looked confused. " Why 4 don't you just need one." he said shakily. "No. one of them could be wrong we need more than two and which ever one has this highest amount + or - than I'm either pregnant or not." which I hope to God I'm not. "Okay" he said grabbing the car keys and slamming the door behind him. "It'll be okay." Ricky assured me, by grabbing me hand and squeezing it, once he noticed me crying. He is one of the few guys who aren't jerks.___________________________________ When Kian got back with the tests I went into the bathroom and came back out ten minutes later. with tears in my eyes. "SO." Kian, Ricky, and Jc all said at the same time I looked over at Kian and said " Congrats you get to be a fucking dad." his face went pale and I ran back into the bathroom. After ten minutes of Kian banging on the door and asking to come in I finally open it. "what." I say sniffling a bit. "What do you mean what I want to talk about you being pregnant with my kid and say I'm sorry I was so dumb." "It doesn't matter no there's no way out of it either your going to help raise this child with me or I'm putting it up for adoption." I say with tears in my eyes." I'm going to ride 'Ghost' to think about it I'll be back in an hour." "Okay..."___________________________________Yay 994 wordsüëçüèºThis is my first fanfic ever in my life.
