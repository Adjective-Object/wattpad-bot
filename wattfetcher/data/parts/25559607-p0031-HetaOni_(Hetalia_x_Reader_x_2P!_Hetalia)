He turned to us all.
"I'm going to have to ask you all to wait a little before we can talk."
"Japan! So you did come here!!" China realises.
"Everyone is all right, I suppose? Excuse me while I deal with this Thing, then." Japan said.
Canada warns Japan, "B-but it's awfully strong..."
"We'll help?" Russia asks.
Japan shook his head. "No need to worry.
... It really did a number on you, didn't it? Allow me to pay it back in kind for the injuries you sustained.
This is quite a convenient opponent for me to unleash my wrath on!!"
I waved my hand in front of me to monitor Japan's status for the battle.
I saw he had his special skill "Blade of Wrath". He used it and in one attack, he was able to defeat the monster.
The screen displays:
Japan was victorious!
25 EXP were received!
100HETA were obtained!
The Thing fades away like a ghost.
"Wow. He looks just like Canada now." Russia says, amused.
Canada pouts, offended. "Just say he disappeared, will you?"
"Can you get up, England?" Japan asks.
"Y-yeah. Anyway, Japan, have you fought that monster before? It wasn't the first time... was it?" England inquires.
Japan looked at his friend, confused. "What? What are you talking about? You have fought it before, too, haven't you? You got here first, after all."
China stepped forward. "We haven't been here for even an hour. And you... weren't even supposed to be here yet."
"That's true, when you put it that way. I mean, China sent Japan a message and Japan replied from the meeting place, right?" Russia said.
Japan nods. "Yes, and then Italy started saying that he wanted to come, too, so Germany, Prussia,and I came with him... but..."
Canada looked confused and spoke, "What? But it takes 3 hours to come here from the meeting place. We really have been here for only about an hour. Don't you think that's a little odd?"
"... There are many things we need to talk about. First of all, let's go to the second floor. I know of a safe room there." Japan said.
China then remembers the cloth he picked up. "W-wait a minute! What about this, then?! What's with these clothes of yours?! They're covered in blood!!"
"Oh. Those are the clothes that I threw into the fireplace. Why do you have them?" Japan asks.
"I found them when I went to that room! Aren't you... hurt...?" China said as he inspected Japan for any noticeable injuries.
"Um, that's... tomato." Japan said monotonously.
China became more confused. "..... Huh?"
"I'm fine; I'm not hurt at all. Now, let's join Germany and Italy and I'll explain the situation to you." Japan says.
All of us headed for the second floor. On our way up, Japan told me to call for Germany and Italy and tell them about the meeting.
Everyone else then went to the 2nd floor in the fireplace room, while I went to the room with the iron door to call Germany and Italy.
