I can spot a liar from 10 miles away.
I've had so many liars in my life.
What glamour hid your lies?
What spell hid them?
It has to be magic.
Otherwise I don't know how I can fall for your tricks.
How I fell for your trick.
How I soo stupidly fell for you.
Hard.
Problem is I love you even though you don't even like me.
You hate me.
Hate.
Loathe.
Despise.
Detest.
But I love you.
Love.
Adore.
Idolize.
Amour.
Cherish.
There is no word quite like love that explains how I feel about you.
Except for pain.
I feel physical pain.
How could I not when you ripped my heart from my chest?
