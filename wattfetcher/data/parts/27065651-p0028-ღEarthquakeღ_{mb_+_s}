I know no one really reads this, but I just wanna say thanks for being so accepting of me here in the fandom. I seriously joined the Marvel fandom/AoS Fandom a little less than a year ago, and I've loved every bit of it. And you guys are just the greatest interwebs friends I could ever ask for. Some of you are even better than my real life friends. And I feel included, and like I belong. I didn't feel that way with my HP RP group. I was Cho Chang, so nothing really happened that I was involved with. But, here, I feel important, like a needed character. Thank you all so much :)
