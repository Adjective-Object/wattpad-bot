"I-I gonna listen." She said and I nodded.
"Good. That's what you're supposed to do." I said and sat her on the counter top.
I finished preparing a salad, which just consisted of taking it out the refrigerator and taking the plastic off of the top and decided to go and put the stuff on the table.
"Daddy." Cara said and I turned towards her.
"Yes baby girl?" I asked.
"I-it's a dance at school." She said playing with her fingers.
"Okay." I said waiting for her to continue.
"Can-can we go?" She asked me and I smiled.
"It's a father daughter dance?" I asked and she nodded.
"Yes. I-I want to-to go bad." She said.
"Cara slow down baby." I told her and she nodded. "We are gonna go to that dance." I said.
I know she's asking me the way she is because I have been flooded with work. I have four big cases and they are all going to trial around the same time so that for me, means double, and triple the time I'm in the office.
"Really!" She asked.
"Oh yes. You, me and Melanie." I said and she smiled brightly.
"I can no wait!" She said and I smiled at her.
Cara has come a far way in class. She's went from a few C's to an A and B student in the past year due to her uprising confidence. She still forgets things from time to time but overall she's doing great.
"I'm glad you're excited. I know daddy hasn't been around a lot in the past few weeks but I promise I'm making time for you and Melanie and we are gonna go dress shopping for you two and we gonna get your hair done and everything." I said
"Thank you Thank you Thank you!" She said which made me smile.
After I got dinner all set and the kids ate Lauren finally came down stairs.
"Hey sleepy head." I said kissing her forehead.
"Hey." She said and yawned.
"Your food is in the microwave pooh." I said and she nodded going for little Devin.
"Thank you." She said and went to feeding him.
"What did he eat?" She asked me.
"He ate some pur√©e apples, bananas and strawberries." I said.
She nodded. "Him still so hungry."
"Yeah he greedy." I said and she smiled.
"He get it from his daddy." She said and I nodded.
"Did he crawl any today?" She asked and I nodded.
"Yeah. I pulled out a blanket and let him crawl. He was in his walker too." I said and she nodded.
"Perfect. He is doing great." She said.
" yeah he is babes." I nodded.
"Thank you for cleaning up the house." She said and I nodded.
"The girls helped." I told her.
"Aw in the morning I'll tell them thank you." She said.
After she ate, we went upstairs. I had already but Devin Junior down.
"Thank you baby." She said.
