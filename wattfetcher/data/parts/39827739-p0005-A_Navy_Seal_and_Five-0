"Hi Uncle Steve" she said without turning around from her computer.
"I still don't know how you do it" I told her.
"It called skill and I don't like being snuck up on" she told me, closing her computer and turning around.
"Really skill, that's the reason you're going with?" I asked her.
"Yep" she replied with a smile. I smiled back and headed into the kitchen to make dinner. I smiled thinking back to the time when she was little and she told me that. Kylie was only five and her dad and her were visiting for the summer; I was playing hide and seek with her and I had searched my entire house for an hour and still couldn't find her. I yelled her name and she still didn't come out of her hiding spot. Before I could yell her name again, she jumped off the stairs and onto my back. If only she was little again, then maybe her dad's death wouldn't be so hard on her.
