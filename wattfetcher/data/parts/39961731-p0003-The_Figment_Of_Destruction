"I find that hard to believe." I admitted.
"Bro. You're even out of his leauge." Alex implied.
Out of his league? He has soft, brown hair with crystal-like eyes. He has a perfect face that all the girls die for. He's 6 foot and is on the basketball team. He's like the perfect guy you dream of. So ic anything, he's out of my league.
"Yeah. Sure." I replied. The bell rang for the beginning of school.
"Ok, people. See ya soon." I called out and started to walk to my class.
"Bye." Alex and Max called back and left.
In this school, there are 8 periods in the day. Homeroom doesn't count as a period since it's only 7 minutes. Everyone has different classes of different subjects. Because high school life is hard, some teachers rarely give out homework.
I entered my homeroom and found a seat to sit at. Homeroom is where you could do whatever you want for 7 minutes. Unfortunately, the teacher always watches you like a hawk.
I watched the more teens enter the the room and start talking to each other. I was bored and was about to doze off until I saw Jesse sit right next to me.
"Hey, Charlotte." Jesse started.
"I told you to call me Charlie." I told him.
"Alright, Charlie." He said.
"Thank you." I replied.
"Nice outfit." Jesse acknowledged. He put his arm around me again.
"Thanks." I said as I pushed his arm off again.
"What's wrong?" He asked.
"Nothing. Just tired."
"Ok. Good. I can't have you upset."
"Why do you care?"
"A guy can have his ways."
"Sure."
"Hello, guys." A voice called out behind us. We turned around and found Lily waving at us.
"Hey, Lily." I called back. She's one of those popular girly girls that attracts every guy. The only difference is she actually nice to everyone.
"Hey, Charlie. Can I talk to Jesse quickly?" Lily asked.
"Sure." I allowed. Jesse looked at me with pleading eyes. He then got up and sat next to Lily.
Jesse and Lily were talking until the bell rang for 1st period. Everyone got out the door and went to their lockers. I went to mine and got out my biology book. I started walking to class when Jesse popped up right next to me.
"Charlie." Jesse called after me.
"Jesse. Where's Lily?" I asked.
"We finished talking just now. We're going to bio, right?"
"Of course. That's our first class. I hear that we're dissecting something today."
"Oh. I bet all the girls in our class are going to be like, 'Ew!' "
"Yeah, but not me. I find that awesome."
"Wow. You're quite different."
"Obviously. Try to keep up." I said. I slapped Jesse in the stomach and walked faster. Jesse ran after me as we entered our class.
"So what did you and Lily talk about?" I asked before we went to our separate seats.
