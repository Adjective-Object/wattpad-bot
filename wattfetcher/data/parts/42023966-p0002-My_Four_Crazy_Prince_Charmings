No one asked anymore questions, so I sat down at a table where Tori was in. She said not to sit to the left chair, she said someone's already sitting there. So I just sat at the right chair. Everyone started talking. Ms BC did the roll.
"Ace?" Wait Ace is in this class? Oh wait maybe it's another Ace.
"Yes, Ms BC! I'm right here! Sorry I had to talk to Mr Stokes."
I turned to where the voice came from and it came from him, Ace.
"Ace!" I exclaimed.
"Oh it's you! Diane!" he said calmly. He sat at the table where Henry was.
"Oh and also Declan is still talking to Mr Stokes." Ace said while facing Ms. BC.
Minutes later "Declan" came in, I couldn't believe it! It's really him! Declan Jasper Stephen! My very first best friend! He's the guy Tori was talking about sitting next to her! Oohh! I can see a bit of chemistry between those two!

1:30 Lunch Time | Ace's POV
Diane, Diane, Diane. Ok I've got to stop thinking about her! But I can't! That's the problem! I asked for Riley's help.
"Riley, can I talk to you for a bit?" I asked him. He walked away from what he was doing-playing soccer.
"You, went to the same primary school with Diane right?" Wait, did they? Are did they just met when Diane was here?
"Yeah, why?" He asked with a cheshire cat smile.
"Just asking if she ever had any boyfriends or crushes... Just curious." I asked nervously.
He looked at me suspiciously.
"Well, if you put it that way, no she's never had a boyfriend." Ohhh! Party party people!! Time to make Ace's moves.
"But she had a lot of admirers and crushes. I've been a victim by that girl, it drove me nuts! Well it stopped when I met Alix. Since then I only looked at one girl." He explained.
Wow! I wonder what's her type though.
"Thanks Riles! That helps heaps!" I said while running away.
"No problem, I guess?" He said.
I've asked Riley, time for Henry's opinion. I looked for Henry and he's with his girl friend-Kristyn Nadine Sugg, the sportiest girl I've ever met. Kristen often hangs out with Tori, Neelu and Faith. Since Tori and Diane are best friends that got separated they decided to catch up. So that means Henry's with Kristyn and Kristyn's with Tori and the other girls that includes Diane. I'm pretty sure she just finished the initiation. I wonder who she's gonna be hand cuffed with. Yeah those are all my ideas.
"Henry do you have a minute?" I tapped his shoulder.
"Yeah, sure. I'll be right back babe." He said to Kristyn and I.
"So what's this about?" He asked me while raising his eyebrow.
"I like this girl, well I'm pretty sure she's close with you and-" I got cut off by him saying my crush's name.
"I'm sorry what?" I innocently asked him.
I looked where he was looking and he was looking at Diane. What is she doing here?
"Not you Henry, you dumpling! I'm calling Ace!" she yelled.
Just her saying my name, I feel blessed already! So happy right now!
