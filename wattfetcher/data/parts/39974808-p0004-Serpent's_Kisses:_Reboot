"They don't matter." Karma said softly, ruffling the hair just a bit. "It's only you that matters here. What do you think of yourself?"
Nagisa stared at his red headed friend, confused. He thought for a moment. 'What did I think of myself? I...."
"I'm stronger.... Faster.... Better..."
Karma's smile widened a bit and he leaned down to be eye level with him.
"Exactly."
Nagisa looked him in the eyes, those amber orbs that seemed to glow with their own mischief behind it.
Yeah, he was stronger, he was faster, he was a better person..... But....
Was he braver?
Was he brave to do what he did or was he just being used like the suicide bombing? Was he actually improved or just a puppet doing what he was told. Taking a deep breath, Nagisa took that step forward.Yes, yes he was. There was no denying that he was braver than he was a few years back. And this was the time to show it.
This was the test.
Putting his arms around Karma's neck he leaned up and kissed Karma on the lips. Karma's reaction was to stop dead and stiffen, but Nagisa didn't care. He pulled away slowly and closed his eyes, not wanting to see the disgust that would be in those sunrise eyes.
"We better head back to class..." Nagisa sidestepped around him, not wanting to see his face, as he headed back to class, leaving the empty bento box behind. He forced that big safe smile on his face. "Koro Sensie is probably worried sick."
And he turned and started walking.
Karma looked after him, his eyes wide with surprise. He touched his lips slowly, smiling a little bit, then looked down at his now giggling pocket. He took out his phone and rolled his eyes.
"You were here the whole time, Ritsu?" He asked, looking at the purple haired AI on the screen. She giggled more and smiled brightly.
"Looks like he likes you, Karma. Think you are going to make that move soon?" She asked, her sea blue digital eyes gleaming with fan girl anticipation. He sighed, shaking his head.
"We'll see, Ritsu. We'll see."
