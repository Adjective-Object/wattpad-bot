"I'm here for you."                   "You're not alone.""You will always have me."
Fucking bullshit. When it's 2:30 A.M. And my self loathing claws it's wayUp my throatAnd rips itself from my mouthIn a silent scream          I am alone. When the blade parts my skin, When the cuts get deeper,           There is no one.           I am alone. When the only real thing isThe blood running down my arms   I am alone. You say you are there...but you are not.
I am alone.
-A.M.
