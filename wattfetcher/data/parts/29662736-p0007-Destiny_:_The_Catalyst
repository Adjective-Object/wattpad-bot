Sorry ash, I was tired after I went to the doctor.
Ok. So how are you holding up?
Well good, I lied
Okay so ill see at school
Bye.
I groaned because the place I want to be is school. I hate t there people stare at me like imp a freak. Well imp kind of weird, don't talks much but I people should mind their own shit.
I got dressed mad headed down stairs and the smell of French toast hit nose.
Hay sweaty, you ready for school
Yes mom. I grabbed a toast and kissed my mom on the cheeks and went out the door
While walking she zoned out again about her night mares. She just thinks she's gong crazy and hearing voices in her head but it's so real. I was snapped from my thoughts when I bumped into something or someone.
Oh my god, imp so sorry.
Oh hey, Dylan right.
Anna right, hey
Yeah, I'm sorry I was zoned out there. It's kind of awkward that I'm bumping into you so much, I chuckle I bit awkwardly.
Ha-ha, it's actually my fault to be looking up and not faced ahead.
Yeah that makes the two of us.
So umm you're going to school around her, Dylan asked
Yeah just ahead.
Oh cool, me too Dylan said. So you want to walk together Dylan asked casually.
Yeah sure as long as you're not a killer
We both burst out laughing, even though I didn't find my own joke funny, but for the sake of it.
So whets your age Dylan asked. I'm 17 and you.
Same.
We walked silently to school with just a few awkward talks along the way.
Okay I'll see you around, Dylan said and walked away
As usual I walked to my locker to get my book.
And then it happened but this time it was different.
