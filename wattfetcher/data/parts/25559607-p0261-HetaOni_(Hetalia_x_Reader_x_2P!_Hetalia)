The blue-eyed Frenchman noticed the Italian's uneasiness and asked, "Italy, are you all right?"





"France..." Italy said as he turned to his big brother figure.





France shook his head and gave a look of concern. "This isn't like you. That expression doesn't suit your face! Even if it's just for a moment, can't you smile-"



"...Listen, France." Italy cut him off, looking directly at the Frenchman's orbs.





France furrowed his brows. "Hm, what?"





"You didn't tell me back then...All this time...even now...I've been waiting for him." Italy said slowly, his eyes seeming to well up as he spoke.






France was taken aback by what he heard, as he felt empathy for him. "...Italy..."





"Hahah...Well, now would be impossible. sorry, I wasn't thinking." Italy apologised, scratching his cheek.





France shook his head and smiled. "No...it's all right."
