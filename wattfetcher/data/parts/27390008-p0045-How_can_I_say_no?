"Wait, you're Samantha Hoffman." He said. I nodded and shook his hand. "You are amazing in this movie. I've seen it a ton." I blushed.

"Thanks. But I wouldn't have a part of it wasn't for johnny." I said. The conversation continued and I could tell Johnny was getting more and more agitated by something. Finally he said we had to go and we left. I waved over my shoulder at them and smiled as I held my phone tightly. I couldn't wait to talk to them again. Especially Dan and Tyler. I had promised them I'd make some videos with them. I saw Johnny look over his shoulder and I swore I heard him growl. "What's wrong Johnny?" I asked and I pulled him with me to an empty hall.

"Nothing." He said. He wouldn't look me in the eye and I knew something was wrong.

"Johnny, don't lie. I know something is wrong. Tell me please." I said. Johnny finally met my eyes and I noticed they softened.

"You'll laugh." He whispered. I leaned up and gently kissed him.

"No I won't. Please tell me." I whispered back. Johnny leaned his head against mine and i put my hands on his cheeks. "Please."

"Alright. I didn't like how they were looking at you. Like you were the only girl they'd seen in their whole lives. Only I can look at you like that." He said. I smiled and kissed him again.

"Oh Johnny, that's so cute." I said. Johnny looked at me confused. "You got jealous. It's cute. Listen to me when I say this and believe me. I may be their fans, I may adore them, I may fangirl over them but I'm your fan first, I adore you first and so much more than I adore them, and I will always fangirl the most over you. I love you and only you. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay with you." I said. Johnny nodded and I stroked his hair. "They don't compare to you at all." I added.

"They don't?" He asked. I nodded.

"Not one bit. I understand if you remain jealous at Lee, Tom and Dan but give Tyler a break." I said. Johnny looked at me skeptically.

"Why?" He asked. I giggled.

"Because he's not into me. Trust me." I said. Johnny nodded slowly.

"Okay but I'm still confused." He said. I giggled and pulled him out of the hall. We made our way to the conference room.

"I'll show you one of his videos later. That will explain everything." I said. Johnny nodded and stopped me. "What?" I asked. Johnny leaned down and kissed me.


"I love you." He said. I smiled and kissed him.

"I love you too." I said.
