Take me somewhere far away,
We can dance to the hypnotic beat of the music,
I'll watch you lose it.
Yeah we can do it.
Lately, I've been feeling kinda starry eyed,
Come with me to see the light
Of a thousand suns
You have begun
The accretion of our galactic hearts as one.
When you leave, there's an unbearable apastron between us.
We're sipping on star dust,
Feeling so elevated tonight.
Tonight,
I'll take you there.
If you feelin high,
If you feelin alright,
Scream it out loud
Go all out.
We on fire
On fire
Fire
