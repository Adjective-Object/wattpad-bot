As I arrive to my garage I open the door to see. Oh shit."why the fuck are you here?" He replies making it up for my baby!" I was angry. I walk upstairs and slam the door. I hear him yell "I'm making pasta!" He continues "be down here for dinner!" He then knocks on my door and leaves a package at the foot of it. It was not wrapped it was my damn I phone I screamed "fuck yea!" As he had a brand new MacBook underneath it. I pick up my phone but leave the MacBook as I restore my iPhone from I cloud and talked to Katlyn
Me- hey slutasaurus Rex how are you my bitch!
Katlyn- Good what's up???
Me- I need a damn drink 😩😭🍺🍻
Kaitlyn- Meet me at Smolders Bar.
As it was time for dinner I wore a sexy red pencil skirt dress and black high heels and I took my purse and right next to it was my gold I phone 6 plus
#fiercebitch
While I walk downstairs I hand him the MacBook and I leave he says "so sexy!" I remark " yes but not for you" as I hand him the MacBook and I walk outside and he says "wait not staying for dinner?" I say nothing while taking the jeep and going to Smolders
And I knew he tagged along
