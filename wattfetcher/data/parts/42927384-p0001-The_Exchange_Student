Amy's POV
When I look out the window I see dark blue skies with little crystal shimmering lights twinkling through the night. When I look below I see pearl blue water with the moon's light reflecting off of it. It looks so calming and elegant, but at the same time dark and mysterious. Maybe that's just my fear of the dark talking. Well not fear but anxiety. This is the only sight I've been seeing for approximately 9 hours now. You'd think that plane rides are fun and exciting for the first time but it's not as fun as you think it is. Especially when you are high up in the sky, locked in this place with no freedom whatsoever. I need air. I need to breathe.
Why am I moving from Russia? What's in America? Those 2 questions I've been asking for a while now but I already knew the answer. My mom had fallen in love with this photographer in Texas named Bruce I think. She was determined to make this work because he couldn't move to Russia. Why? I have no clue. Next thing I know my mother and I have been on this plane and I'm pretty much ready to get off (or jump off at this point in time). When you take the time to look over on some things I realize that maybe this is a good thing for me. Back at home in Russia I was this teenage model and my mother was a wedding dress designer. (Ever heard of the show Say Yes To The Dress? Well you could thank her for some of those elegant and wonderful dresses that had been created.)
