Hello, Annalise (arosequartz) here!
Warning, if any of this story seems familiar to you, it's because I posted this from fanfiction to here. Yes the story is still on the original fanfiction site.
Gordie/OC
Note: This is not a story where the boys all fight over the girl, and I promise she doesn't steal any of the characters' lines or is added in awkwardly. Seriously I've gotten long reviews on fanfiction saying how wonderful the story is.

The young aged woman stepped out the back door, wrapped up in only a white bathrobe that hit her mid thigh. Bare feet pressed against the dark wooden deck, a cup of coffee in hand. The sky was clear, revealing tiny bright stars to contrast against the black night. A half moon shone, illuminating the tops of trees and lampposts. The time was 1:05, way early to be awake on a Saturday morning. But she couldn't sleep, and had slipped out from her husband's arms to breath in the warm air of summer. A light breeze blew through her straight black shoulder length hair, causing a few pieces to tickle her face.
Unable to help herself, her mind wandered back to that summer where her whole life changed. The year was 1959, and it all began, with a tree house, and a card game.
