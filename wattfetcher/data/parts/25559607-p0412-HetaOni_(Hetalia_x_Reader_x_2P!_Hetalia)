"Who....did this to you...?" Past Luciano asked, gritting his teeth.
Clutching his bleeding stomach, he spoke slowly and tried to move, "...The Thing...that monster...it attacked us. It was after us...all of us..."
"Wait, Gil, don't-don't move... We'll get you bandaged right up! I-I have a med kit in here in my bag somewhere!" Past (Name) said frantically, searching through her bag.
Past Gil shook his head weakly. "Nein...you don't need to do that anymore... It's too late...I'm meeting my inevitable end already..."
"No no no... You won't! That's...that's just your depression talking, Gilen! I'll take care of your...wounds...and then we'll get out of here....and everything will work out fine! So...so...just..." Past (Name) rambled, denying what was happening before her.
Placing a hand on top of hers, Gil looked at her, making her stop speaking. "I appreciate it, frau...but, I'd rather have you getting out of this place as soon as possible. Back then, I thought that this world was as sad and dark as the day we were created...but then, we met you. You were like our light. I don't want that light to be taken away from this world, so...please, go..."
"Gil..." the girl whispered, not knowing what to say or do.
Turning to the Italian, Past Gil spoke, "Luciano....take her away from here..and...if you see my brother, tell him...I'm sorry."
"Si...I will." Past Luciano nodded.
Past (Name) shook her head. "This can't be...Why...Gil..."
Hesitantly, Luciano pulled the girl's arm and led her towards the door. Leaving the albino all by himself.
"Don't...be sad, frau...that's my thing...heh." Past Gil chuckled to himself lightly. Giving her the rarest of smiles, the Prussian spoke, "....Maybe...I'll see you again someday."
Closing his eyes, Past Gil gave his last breath.

The memory suddenly changed to a new scene. It was still on the first floor, but this time, it was the hallway near the two bathrooms.

"Well, our stay here wasn't that bad of a time...but it looks like this is our end." Past Nikolai said, wincing in pain. He couldn't move anymore, since his legs were bitten deeply by the creature.
The Chinese man beside him faced the girl who stood in front of them. "We fought against that monster as... honourably as we could, but it might still... lurk around this place. It's best for you two... to leave us be." he said weakly, coughing out blood.
"Nikolai...Zao...I'm sorry...if only we got here sooner..." Past (Name) said softly.
The Russian shook his head. "I'm actually glad. If you got here sooner, you could've been in serious danger." he told her. Chuckling a little, he continued, "(Second Name), at first I thought you were some pain-in-the-ass brat we just had to pick up....but I realised that you were actually like vodka."
