Since Nadeshiko here is running out of ideas here. I decided to make a request box!
Comment here or other one shots that I will post.
Strictly no lemons please. Fluff is good but please. No. Lemons.
Comment which character you want me to make and a give me a prompt (Ex: Pocky Game and etc.) And I will dedicate that One shot to you!
So it would be like this:Ex:Character Name: Cecil AijimaPrompt: Cat And I'll be the one to make the adjustments. Easy right? :3
Well, If you like the idea, comment down which character you want me to do next! :3 (If you want an angsty one then I'll give it to you! Just add it though.)
Have a nice day everyone!
