Sqaishey's POV:
I cant believe this is happening right now. My heart skipped a beat. "Hello?" He said. I didn't know what to say. "Um... um... um...." Were the only words that were able to escape my mouth. ''Hello?'' He said once again. I could tell he was confused. ''Hi!'' I finally managed to say. ''Hi!'' He said back to me. "I can't believe this.'' I said in shock. "Can't believe what?" He asked me. "I cant believe that you, Stampylongnose, are actually talking to me." Well 'ya better believe it!" Stampy said. I giggled. "So what is your name?" He asked me. ''My real name is Beth, and my YouTube name is Sqaishey Quack. Most people call me Sqaishey." I said. ''Well nice to meet you Sqaishey!" He said back to me. I giggled.
Stampy's pov:
I think I have seen one of her videos before. I think it was called A Game For Stampy. She told me a little bit about her. She seems really nice. I kind of want to see what she looks like. I asked her for her Skype and we called each other at around 5:00. Her hair started to shine in the sunset at it was going down. Her pretty eyes were staring into my heart. She was beautiful. "Hi Stampy!" She said. "Umm.. Stampy? Are you ok? Stampy?'' ''Oh sorry!" I said. I guess I was daydreaming. ''So.. why did you want to switch to skype?'' She asked. ''No reason.'' I said. I think i'm in love.
