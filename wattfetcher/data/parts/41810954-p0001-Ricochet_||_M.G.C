"Good luck today kiddo." My older brother Ashton, said to me as I stumbled out of his car.
I smiled slightly and heaved my bag over my right shoulder, "You say that everyday."
"I only want my little sister to have a good day at school." Ashton chuckled, nudging me out of the car.
I rolled my eyes and slammed the door shut, waving at him while he drove away in the piece of tin he called a car. It was old and red, the headlights didn't work so he couldn't legally drive at night unless he stuck torches to it, which looked incredibly stupid. He tried and failed miserably.
But being a seventeen year old that works at KFC doesn't earn you much, especially when you drum constantly on the counter and annoy the customers with your annoying singing. That's Ashton wrapped up in one, even he couldn't deny it.
I turned around and started walking up the path to the school gates when my name was called out by none other than Michael, "Tiegan!"
I smiled to myself and spun on my heels to face him, Luke and Calum. "Hey," I smiled, "You need a hair cut."
Michael shrugged and slung his arm over my shoulder, leading me into the school gates and pressing a kiss to my temple, "That's not going to happen, Shortie."
"You're not exactly the tallest, Mr Clifford." I answered, looking at him with a sly smile.
"I'm five foot nine, leave me alone." He chuckled, skipping past the impatient teachers stood at the gate who gave us a glare from clearly being late. "You're the one who's five, one."
"Oh shut up." I fake huffed, looking at Luke and turning to him since we had first class together.
"Mr Wilson's class will be fun." Luke sighed. Mr Wilson was one of the most annoying teachers you could ask for and I always tried to not be a judgmental bitch, but he made it too hard.
Okay, that's a lie. I'm a judgemental hoe and everyone knows it.

Not even ten minutes into Mr Wilson's class and we were all bored shitless. Although we tried to be as late as possible, it didn't work. We'd only missed the first few minutes of the boredom we had an hour of.
Luke was slouched next to me, his head resting on the palm of his hand, looking down at his phone he had under the desk, "You don't make it obvious, do you?" I laughed quietly.
He shrugged his broad shoulders and went back to scrolling through Twitter to pass the time that was no doubtably going to drag on and on.
I sighed and rested my chin on the desk, desperately searching the room for something more entertaining to watch other than the tiny man in front of me. Mr Wilson was around five foot six, still taller than me but almost everyone is.
"Tiegan, are you listening?" Mr Wilson asked, folding his arms across his chest.
I gave him a slight glare before nodding my head, heat rising in my cheeks when everyone turned to face me. I felt Luke panic and slip his phone away and also give Mr Wilson a glare.

Hola
Yes, I deleted all my other fan fictions because I hated them and they weren't going anywhere but I've had the idea for this one for a while.
Sorry I guess?
