"You're not trash, trust me. You're actually really beautiful, Jennifer," Andrea said, picking her spoon up again. "I usually hate seafood, but I'm glad you forced me to get clam chowder."
Jenn smiled. "Yeah, you're welcome, I guess. I've always loved seafood, you know?" She took a bite out of her fish.
"I've always loved you, you know?" Andrea spilled, partially mocking Jenn's overuse of "you know?"
Jenn choked on her food for a brief moment. "You what?"
At this point, Andrea was hysterically laughing. "I compared everyone to you, and I didn't even know you. You were so sweet."
"I was an annoying kid."
"You told me you loved me, too."
"Yes, I know," Jenn said, "and I was an annoying kid who loved you." Andrea smiled, although Jenn was too focused on her food to see.
The two glanced at each other every so often, but wanted to finish their food so they could have time for other things later. Andrea would hum, taking small spoonfuls of her soup. Jenn would simply cut her fish, stick the cut part in her mouth, and chew. The two focused on these things about each other.

After the two headed to Andrea's apartment, they flopped down on Andrea's bed. Jenn nearly fell asleep, being tired for whatever random reason, while Andrea was wide awake. It was just as normal as it had always been.
"Let's read our old conversations. C'mon, it'll be fun," Andrea pleaded, handing Jenn her laptop.
Jenn obeyed, turning it on and heading to the website they'd been on together. She logged in, looking at Andrea, then at the screen. "Oh, here it is." Jenn pulled it up.
Andrea scooted closer to Jenn and kissed her cheek. "Your last message was..."
"... Did I really say this?"
