"It's alright. You'll meet some new people." Courtney said as we walked down the stairs. We were greeted by about five friends outside. Courtney's boyfriend Shaun, her best friend Hannah, Sarah and Luke's best friend Jacob.
I put the box in Bronte's car. I wish I decided to go with dad but he would never let us stop at Macca's on a road trip. I guess I'm using Bronte because she would stop to get to like me. At least I've got Courtney with me.
"Aw Emma." Sarah said with tear rimmed eyes. I hugged her and quickly got a selfie. I said goodbye to Jacob, Hannah and Shaun. My biggest one was going to Sarah of course.
"Now Emma. Promise me if you see Cam you have to say hey." She whispered. "Goodbye girly. I might try visit you in LA to stalk some celebs." She winked. We went in for another hug.
"See you Sar. I'll Skype and call as much as I can." I hopped in the car and plugged my headphones in. We waved as our house went out of sight.
In Bronte's Honda we didn't talk that much. I guess it was the sadness for me and Courtney or the nerves. Luke and dad were travelling behind us with the removals truck behind them.
"Well girls this will be exciting eh?" Bronte said. Boy... this is going to be a long 13 hours.-----So everyone I had a writers block with the other book and I was writing this at the time as well. I guess I've found this one more interesting for writing. Also credits to ALDCXWIFI for inspiration!!! ily! - Maya xxx
