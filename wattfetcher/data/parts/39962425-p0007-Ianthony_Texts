I: What, what, what, what?
A: There is a spider on my laptop crawling towards me.
I: Then kill it.
A: Nooooooooo!!!!

A: It's a furry bug thing with 8 legs that can kill you.
I: Technically, it's not a bug...
A: WHATEVER IT IS IT IS ON MY FUCKING LAPTOP PLEASE SAVE ME!
I: Fine. I'll be there in a second.
A: You know I love you right?
I: Yeah. I love you too, even if you're scared by a tiny arachnid.
A: Shut up and save me you dick.
I: Not until you say I love you.
A: I love you
I: Why do you love me?
A: Because you save me from scary bugs.
I: Fair enough.
I: Anthony, the spider was dead already.
A: Pip attacked it 5 minuets ago.
