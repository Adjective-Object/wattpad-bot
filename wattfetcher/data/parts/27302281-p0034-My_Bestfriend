I woke up and looked over to notice a sleeping kylie in my arms so I smiled at her and  moved some hair out her face  to behind her ear then got up and tried not to wake her up
Then i ran my finger through my hair  and then threw shoes on then climbed out the window to my car and drove to selenas when I turned down her road I knew it to well to miss and drove down the road then turned in her drive way  and left my car on then walked up to the door and knocked  then selena came to the door
" coming back for more I see "  she smirked
" no I came to talk " I said crossing my arms waiting for her response
" come in " she sighed
" listen selena what was going on between us has to end I can't do that to kylie   "  I said scratching the back of my neck
" no promises" she said
" listen up you lay one finger on kylie you will have to deal with me we are done I'm in love with someone else  "  I threated  pushing her against the wall
"  like I said no promises " she said bravely
"Leave her alone  cause if you hurt her  I don't care if I get arrested I will do anything  to protect her ok " I yelled gripping her arm
"  fine " she hissed  pushing me away
" don't you " I said but she cut me off
" I'm not gonna hurt her now get out "she yelled
" ok " I said leaving
I walked straight out the door and didnt look back  got back in my car and drove off
I have to drive into town and pick a few things up for Kylie's surprise then when I got everything I set it up
Hope she likes it
Kylie
I woke expecting to see a sleeping justin beside me so  I looked around and saw  box beside me  so I sat up and opened   the box then removed the white paper and pulled out a card that said
