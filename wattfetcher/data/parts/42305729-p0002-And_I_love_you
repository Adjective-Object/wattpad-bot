And when you come back I start living, there is something between us and I think I am the only one that can notice it.
I mean yeah this love is stupid but what the hell, is my fuc**** problem, I love you and anybody can change that.

I can't hold this anymore. I was afraid of reconize what I feel but a friend told me that I need to be brave and shout everybody my feelings.
I don't have to be embarrased, its normal, anybody decide the person to fall in love for.
So here I am again trying in a different way to tell the world what I feel for you, I mean this is an advance, two weeks ago I'll never think even to write.
You aren't special, you aren't handsome. But there is something...
