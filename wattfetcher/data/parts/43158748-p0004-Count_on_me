"Thanks Pit." I smiled up to him."Say...would you like to help me finish it? It'll be even better if an angel were to lend a hand."
"Aw, you really want me to help? Well sure! Why not?" He smiled.
I repeated the song again,"You can count on me like, one, two, three..."
"I'll be there."Pit sung after a second. "And I know when I need it I can count on you like, four, three, two you'll be there."
I looked at him and smiled, quickly writing it down,  "Yep, that'll work! Thanks Pit!"
"Wait you really think it will work?"Pit asked and I nodded.
"It will, it sounds good."I said smiling up to him.
"Well, it's getting dark. I need to go back to skyworld, and you need to go home." Pit stood up and grabbed my hand, pulling me up.
I closed my book and nodded,"Alright." A frown found it's way to my face. I i was a little sad to be honest.
"Hey, don't get all sad on me, alright Debra? I'll come back and when I do get back, I wanna hear about what you've done to the song, okay? " Pit smiled down to me.
"You promise?"I asked and he nodded
"I promise! Angels can't brake promises either!"
