I am a broken soul, Shattered and empty bottles clutter my mind, Forgetting to allow the blossoming of my creativity To grow anymore. Ghosts live in my head, Haunting me with every silhouette. Let me go, Stop holding on to whatever it is you want to call me. I'm not human, Nor am I animal, I am too much of a mess for you to try to fix me. Distance yourself from me Before the demons lying within, go after You, too, - (m.m)
