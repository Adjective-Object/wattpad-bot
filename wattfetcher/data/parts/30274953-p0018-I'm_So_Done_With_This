I think my boy cat is in love with my girl cat. Because my girl cat was a stray and we think she had an abusive owner before my cousin found her and gave her to us-She's very skittish- and my boy cat has to go threw her hissing and growling and I think he understands she needs her space. So he will distance himself from her but close enough to where he can still see her. I ship it but there is one problem. It's Romeo and Juliet all over again. The boy cat is my brothers' and the girl cat is mine. So they stay in opposite rooms and my second oldest brother-the middle child-refuses to let the boy cat stay in my room for more than ten minutes at a time. I ship it.
I also think I could write a story out of this.
Let's think of some ship names shall we: I know a lot of us are fangirls.
So the girl cat is named Jazzi (she looks like a little jaguar) and the boy cat is Smoky. Let us begin.
