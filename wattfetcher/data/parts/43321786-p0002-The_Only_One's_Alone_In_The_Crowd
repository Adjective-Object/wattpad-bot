"What about you? I'm sure your life isn't so depressing as mine." I joked lightly and she smiled, seeing that I was relaxing around her and that was the truth.
"Well for me, my parents are always working, I have a lot of foster brothers and a loving grandma, I'm the only child that isn't adopted." She sums up her lifestyle pretty quickly.
"Hey, since we're talking about our lives and stuff and we don't even know each other names." She laughs making me laugh as well.
"My name's Laura, Laura Marano." I introduce myself.
"Vanessa Angels." She smiles and we shake hands like we're just now introducing ourselves even though we've been talking for a long time.
"Hey, you have a suitcase right? That means your moving away from home by yourself." She says surprisingly.
"No." I smile lightly. "I'm not moving away, I'm running away."
"Oh" Is all what her responds with and then I can see a smile tracing on her lips.
"What?" I ask. What's funny about running away from home when your stepmother treats like you don't want to be treated?
"Your running away and you have nowhere to go so..follow me!" She says, getting up, I stay in my seat, looking at her surprised.
"Cmon or do you want me to leave you here?" I shake my head and she grabs my hand running of and I just have enough time to get my suitcase, soon we are running to....wherever we are going.
But where are we going?
And where is Vanessa taking me?
