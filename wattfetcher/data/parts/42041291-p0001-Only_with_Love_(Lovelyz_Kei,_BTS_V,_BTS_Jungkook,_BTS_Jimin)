*Beep Beep Beep*
Once the alarms rang, I directly woke up with a fresh smile.
I stood up from my bed and opened my blinds. "What a nice day today."I muttered to myself.
I immidiatly went to the bathroom for me to shower. When I was done taking a bath I got out of my room and went downstairs.
"Eomma! Good morning!"I happily said.
"Kei, Good morning to you too."She said.
"Good morning, V!"I said as I took the seat in front of him.
He sighed and gave a irritated look. "Morning."he said, then looked away.
I'll just have to work harder for him to accept me in the family.
"What's for breakfast, Eomma?"I asked.
"Bacon for today."Eomma said while cooking the Bacon's.
I was kinda feeling thirsty, so I drank the cup of water near me.
"Yah! That's mine!"V said.
"Oh! Sorry."I said as I lowered my head.
I stood up to get a glass of water for V since I drank his but before I could get it he held my wrist.
I looked down at him and made a questioning face.
"Uh.....What's wrong?"I asked.
"I'll get my own glass."He said, then stood up.
"No..I'll ge ---"
"Just listen to me, Pabo."He said then moved to get the glass of water.
I smiled at him. "Gomawo, V."I said.
He just ignored me and got his glass of water.
"Here's your bacon's!"Eomma said.
"Oh....they look yummy!"I said with a smile.
"Really? Thanks kei! Your the best daughter I can ever have!"She said.
I smiled at her then I noticed V eating my bacon.
"Yah! V, You got my bacon!"I pouted.
I saw his cheeks big like a chickmuk.
Then he swallowed it. "Y-You took my water too, you know!"he defended he's self.
"Haha.....I still have a lot more, so don't worry."Eomma smiled.
"Oh, look at the time you're going to be late."I smirked at V.
"Late? I know--"he stopped because he saw it was already 9:30am.
His eyes widen and he directly ran back to his room.
"Yah, finish your food!"Eomma said.
"I'll finish it for tomorrow, just place it at a the refrigerator."he said as he hurriedly went to his room.
"Haha...."I laughed at him.
