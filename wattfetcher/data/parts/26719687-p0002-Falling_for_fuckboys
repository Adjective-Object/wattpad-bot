"Will you get the fuck up already". the words I wake up almost every morning, like yeah thanks mum. Your great. But I didn't have time for her shit today I was already late. I took a shower and then I got out and was brushing my teeth when my brother started banging on the door, "God dammit you take like 80 years" he yelled. I ignored him and finished and even took extra time to straighten my hair. "God you don't have to take so fucking long" he said as he shoulder shoved me, "yeah and you don't have to be so rude either" I said ignoring him and walking to my room. I got dressed, literally a crop top that said "fuck off" and ripped jeans that I wear like everyday. Then my sister yelled upstairs "destiny your stupid boyfriends here", and a few seconds later my door opened. "Hey babe" Nathan said sitting down, now I don't mean to brag but god damn I did good picking him, tall, tanned, and athletic, Damn I was lucky he's probably the only thing that makes this hell bearable, except my best friends.  "Nathan you are aware it's 8:45, and you missed your first class right" I said as I was putting on my shoes, "I know. When you didn't show up I left to come get you" he said smiling. "Awe babe. How cheesy and chich√© of you" I said grabbing my bag, "oh you love it" he said grabbing my hand and leading me out of the room. "Later mum" I said walking out the door.
