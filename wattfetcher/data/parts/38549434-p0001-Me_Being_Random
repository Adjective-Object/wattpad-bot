I have instagram basically you take a picture and you share it with all your followers and people you follow? I dunnoI mean when I got instagram I was likeYES!!!.................................wait what do I do now?I mean seriously I had to follow a RANDOM person just to get started then I had to search up BILLIONS of names and when I FINALLY found someone I knew they were on private and that's great but how do I find other people's accounts I always find people's accounts by seeing who they are following but this guy was on private and when I sent a request to be their follower it took MILLIONS of hours for them to accept.
But now I'm fine.ðŸ˜‹
