"Hey make sure everybody gets everything sorted I'll be back in like ten minutes." He walked out to me, "Let's go."
"Okay."
"So what's up?" He asked as we started to walk around.
"Nothing much. Just haven't hung out with you in a while." I said.
"Dude I know this tour is crazy I don't know how they do it." He said, "I think this is the longest we've gone without hanging out."
"Yeah I know."
"Wanna go get something to eat real quick?" He asked.
"Sure, I'm starving."
"Perfect. So what's life like on Of Mice's bus?"
"Its crazy and loud but it's fun."
"Cool." He said, "You're being really... Short with me. Usually I can't get you to shut up."
I shrugged, "Roy's being a dick and Austin is just being distant with me."
"Well when is the asshole not being a dick?" Kellin said and I laughed.
"True, but I don't know what's going on with Austin but it's starting to worry me. What if he wants to break up or something?"
"He's just worried about Roy. He knows you have a long, horrible history with the prick."
"Well he shouldn't be worried. I'm not going back to him I just have this stupid project to work on with him."
"I know but he's just scared he'll get into your head again. I'm worried he's gonna get into your head again."
I shook my head, "I'm not going to let him. I don't want to go back to him ever."
"Alan you said that to me once and you were nearly killed by him when you tried leaving. I'm surprised he didn't come after you."
"Well it's different this time."
"How is it different?"
"Because now I'm dating a guy who treats me right and hasn't done a thing to hurt me, that's how it's different. Why would I ever leave a guy who's a perfect gentleman -most of the time- to go back to someone who hits me?"
"Well I'm glad you finally see that because I could never get to you. Ever."
"Well I guess I just found that guy."
"I'm glad, I didn't like seeing you hurt."
"Come on it wasn't that bad Kellin."
"Alan he used to beat you, not to mention pretty much control every aspect of your life."
"He didn't beat me. He just... What did he call it? Put me in check or something. I wasn't beaten."
"He hit you. That's beating you."
I rolled my eyes, "It didn't bother me... I didn't listen anyway."
"I don't believe that for a second" He said, "We all know that it bothered you. But it doesn't matter anymore. You're with someone who's ten times the man Roy is."
"I am with someone ten times better. He's absolutely perfect."
"Well I wouldn't say perfect but he's pretty good." Kellin said.
"He's perfect for me and to me and just amazing." I said smiling.
"That's good. I don't wanna have to call my hitman. Or have to worry about you."
