"I-I, um, i.."
Lena smiles. "Come on, spit it out."
"I," I squeeze her hand tighter and smile. "I fucking love you." I waste no time to press my lips against hers and wrap my arms around her waist. She kisses me back and hangs her arms off shoulders. It hurts like hell and I'm pretty sure most of my body is bruising and broken bones but I couldn't care less right now. Lena is the most interesting girl I've ever met and I want nothing more than to spend all my time trying to figure her out.
Lena's POV
Holy cannoli,
He said he loves me.
I can't put into words how amazing it feel right now to be so close to Jeff.
I don't know if I love him, but what else could this be?
"We should... probably get out... of the street before... the police come," I say, taking heavy breaths after every few words."
Jeff chuckles a bit then nods. "Lets go."

"Wyatt!" I call to him as I enter the cellar with Jeff on my arm.
"Yes!" He smiles and runs to the door to greet us. His face falls as he sees how beat up Jeff is. "Are you okay?"
Jeff shakes his head and leans in on my shoulder. "I'm going to take Jeff to his room, you need to get me ice, water, the first aid kit, and a couple blankets. Can you do that for me?" I ask Wyatt.
"Okay." Wyatt takes off to get me my supplies and I walk Jeff to his room.
I lay him down on his bed, he groans and grunts on the way down but I can't complain.
He's in a lot of pain.
"Come lay with me?" He asks.
"I thought there was no one on the bed?" I ask, jokingly.
He rolls his eyes. "Shut the fuck up and come here."
I crawl onto the bed and lay beside Jeff. I gently wrap my arms around him and kiss his cheek.
He chuckles a bit. "Thanks for saving me back there."
I look at him and give him a small smile. "Well, thanks for saving me, too."
