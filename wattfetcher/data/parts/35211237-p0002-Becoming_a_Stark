It was only until Pepper turned round away from the counter to pour the cup of flour into a bowl behind her on the island did she get noticed.
"JARVIS! Did you get the." Pepper started turning around just mid sentence. The glass measuring cup full of baking flour she was holding slipped out of her hand and shattered on the floor sending flour along with chips of glass everywhere. This is what captured everyone's attention.
The thumb wrestling stopped. The Mario Cart game paused. And The newspaper was put down. No one dared to speak. They just all stood frozen. Not daring to speck or move as soon as they saw what Pepper had dropped the measuring cup at.
Tony was the first one to get up and see if it really was her.
He stood up from his place on the couch and the thumb wrestling match and walked over to her. He looked her in the eye and couldn't believe the sight in front of him. It was her, and she was awake.
"Taylor..." he stuttered still not believing this.
"Hey dad..." Taylor chuckled back.
