She approached the  door quietly before it creaked opened. Then, part of the gun was seen  out of the door. She then opened the door and both her and the sniper  were confused.

Down  the ground below, Aya was lurking in shadows but her eyes landed on a  fluffy man. Her eyes narrowed until she realized that he saw her. He  flashed her a grin before putting up his middle finger.

"That mean Flamingo!" Aya silently exclaimed with puffed cheeks. A loud blast was heard before Sakura crashed into the alley.

"Damn."

There  panic everywhere.

"That useless lizard bitch can't do anything can she?" Haruka asked himself ,twichting.

"I heard that." Sakura whispered before looking at the sniper above.

"Everyone, don't worry. It's gonna be alright." Aya said trying calm the crowds down.

Sakura: Sky Barrier.

Suddenly,  a large dome of cool air surrounded the royal families and the almost  newly coronated Queen. The bullet which was supposed the hit the  Princess, got caught on one of the winds and flew out the window in the  opposite direction.

"How did this happen?" Aya asked.
"Well..."

Going back to few minutes earlier...

Both Sakura looked at each other.

"Who are you?"
"I'm a sniper. Who are you?"
"A student from the Grandline."

"What are you doing?"
"Trying to snipe the princess. You?"
"Trying to protect the Princess."

"So that means we're enemies."
"Yeah, that's about right."

The sniper aimed for her head and fired but Sakura calmly dodged it.
"You're disturbing the atmosphere." Sakura calmly stated.
"Huh?"

Sakura: Roar of the Sky Dragon.

With that, a tornado of air rushed towards the sniper. He was lucky that even manage to dodge that.

"Ah,  that was my best one." Sakura panted. This one was still quite new.   The sniper, taking this opportunity threw a grenade at Sakura. She  guarded herself but the force still sent her crashing into the alley.
