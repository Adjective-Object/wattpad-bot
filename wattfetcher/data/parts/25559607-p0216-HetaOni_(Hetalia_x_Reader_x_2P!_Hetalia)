"Gack!" Italy let out, surprised at the sudden jerk of his arm.

"Wow, a haunted house? Sounds interesting! Let's go! I'll ask the others if they want to come along!" America beamed, whilst munching on a burger.


Italy nodded and smiled. "Uh-huh! I'll do the same!"


America cupped his chin and spoke, Â "I don't think Japan will want to, though...Anyway, there are many others we can ask!"


"If he doesn't come, I'll try asking him! Er...There is a city nearby, you see, and from there you have to go... er... er..." Italy paused, trying to recall what he heard earlier.

Suddenly, they felt a breeze. It wasn't like it was from a window, though... it was more of something dashing past them.

Italy caught on to something at that split-second, though. A word. He heard a word.
"East"

Italy snapped his fingers and exclaimed, "East! You go east, and you'll find a big western-style house. I'm pretty sure that's it! I heard that you'll know it's it right away!"

"OK! East, right? It probably won't be in a very good condition. At least we'll have fun together!" the energetic American gave a thumbs up.

Italy smiled and spoke excitedly, "Yeah~ I think they're still in the meeting room. Let's go back, quickly!"

"Oh... A haunted house, is it?" Japan mused.

America nodded and pat the Japanese man's shoulder enthusiastically. "Don't you think it's interesting?! The meeting is finally over and we have nothing better to do, so I thought we could all go together!"


"What are you going to do, Japan?" asked Italy.


Japan looked at the two hesitantly and spoke, "Well... I'll see what I can--"


"Aww, c'mon, let's have fun! I'm telling you, everyone is coming!"America said, trying to convince his friend to join them.


Germany placed his hands on his hips. "If so many people drop by there,it won't be a test of courage. Why don't you go first to take a look?"
