I don't think that I'm the only person that have been in confusion with there sexuality. Now that I start thinking maybe the half teenage population (maybe more) have this confusion. Only if you start experimenting or looking for information you will see what you are. I know that this phase of confusion for me started in the 9th grade. I was this little shy thing until this girl stud up from any other girl. I thought she was something else, maybe her eyes, her skin or her voluptuous curly hair. She had something different. We started talking like friends until I came to this point that I didn't know what I liked. I cried for days even months because of it, but like a really good bestie she was; she told me to look for information. I look until I found the term BISEXUAL. That's when I found out what I liked. I knew that I like boys... A lot, but I look at the girls with the same eyes. That's when I knew. I know that it may be a little hard but when you come to terms with who you are, you will be happy. Take it from me
