"So how did it go," Sarah said as she picked me up from jazz band, I was really beginning to like her, she's like the mom I never had. Eli waved to me as he got into his car, I waved back. "I see you made a friend," she said. "Yeah," I replied, "to bad he's not Russian." "It's unfortunate I know," Sarah said and the car lunged forward away from the school. "So did you set up the circular things," "Yes, and I saw the most weirdest thing, I saw another circular thing that I didn't put down, it wasn't mine but it was there, I don't know who put it there, and it had the Russian logo, it's hard to explain," "Hmmmm, well maybe your not alone after all, some of the other people in Russia set out kids on missions in America too. So maybe you could get some help if you figure out exactly who put it there." Sarah said with a smile. I thought this over"Your right, I will try to find out who's putting them there sarah," I said eagerly, I glanced over at sarah who smiled back at me. She looked like a mom to me, she treated me like one too. "Or should I say mom," this startled her and a tear rolled down her cheek and onto her big smile just as we pulled into our drive way. "Me and your... Father will go and look at the circular things data you set up," she head inside real quick. I knew this was all new to her, after all she hasn't been called mom in a long time ever since her only kid died in a training "accident," I began to head inside to eat, rest, refill on circular things, look over data I may need to know, and do my home work. I could tell that tomorrow was going to be a long day.
