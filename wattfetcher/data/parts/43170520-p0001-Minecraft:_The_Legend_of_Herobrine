It is said that a legendary brother of the great Notch, ruled all 3 realms - The Overworld, The Nether and The End. But when Notch came into power by releading the world of Minecraftia to the public, his brother was overthrown and exiled to the Nether.
But he gained power there as well, and he soon became king, ruling all monsters of the Nether. His monsters brought word of this promising master to the Overworld and The End, and the monsters there, too, bowed down to him.
Seeking power and revenge, he sent forces to the Overworld to kill Notch, in hope of once again ruling Minecraftia. The monsters destroyed many villages, bombed numerous cities, and killed many people, but Notch proved to be too powerful an enemy. As he watched his army of monsters perish, he decided he would go kill Notch himself, for his monsters were too weak compared to himself.
However, as he fought in hand-to-hand combat with Notch, he was delivered a fatal blow while he tried to fight off Notch's army...
His name is Herobrine. Though he is now dead, he is destined to rise again. But this time, he will be more powerful than anyone can ever imagine...
