"How's Lucy? Is Cameron still bugging her about college?" I'm trying to talk about anything other than our problems, but that's more difficult than it seems.
Matt nods. "Yeah, ever since she dropped out of community college, Cam has been telling her that she either needs to go to back to college, or leave and get a job. He just wants her to leave." He shakes his head, probably thinking about how his life would change if Lucy wasn't there to help him.
He looks up at me, looking happy for a change. "But, Jacob is fine. He loves kindergarten, and he actually made friends. It's good. I wish I was like him when I was younger." He loves his little brother, and he is proud of everything the kid does. At least he has something that he can hold onto.
"What about Emma? Has she found a friend?" Emma is only nine, and she is already turning out like the two of us. Matt furrows his eyebrows, and shakes his head. He doesn't need to explain any further.
Matt's parents died in a car crash around three years ago, before I moved here. His older brother, Cameron, was twenty at the time, so he just took over the household, and attempted to be a parent role. Apparently, he used to be a nice guy, but the stress of dealing with four children can make anyone turn into a downer.
We trudge through the woods, making our own path. We might get lost, but we are both smart enough to find our way out. We'll be fine.
I notice a clearing up ahead, in between the many clusters of trees. I turn to ask Matt if we should head that way, but he is already gazing at it dreamily and walking towards it.
We push past the tightly packed trees that surround the small meadow, and gasp at the beauty of this place. The grass is a lush green, and there are dozens of species of wild flowers scattered around us.
A small, oval-shaped pond sits in the middle of this hidden place. We approach it, and peer into the still water. Our reflections stare back at us as we gaze into the pool.
