Caspers POV

I was on the airplane heading for London, when I realized what was about to happen, I was moving in with Joe Sugg! I of course knew that already but I didn't hit me untill now. What if he changes his mind once I get there so then I wouldn't have anywhere to go, what if I'm the one chickening out about living with him and because of that I offended him, what if... '' Casper just shut up'' Then a fight attendant comes up, ''sir, is every thing ok?'' Shit, was I talking out loud??? Did I just say everything out loud?!?! Before I even know what I'm doing I tweeted,  ''what the hell I just say? #Annoyed.''  '' Sir...'' ughhhh, forgot. '' Sorry, yes I'm ok''  She just nodded and left, thank God.  My phone went off, yay something to get '' him'' off my mind, (a tweet) @Casper wanna tell me?? Gotta do something to get Oil (Oil White, British youtuber)  to stop trying to tickle me, it's just embarrassing  :) - Joe Sugg. Who's that??? That his boyfriend?? Hope not... Wait, why do I care?? This is gonna be a long flight.

I'm getting off the plane, I'm at some airport,  Joe is supposed to be picking me up around... now, I guess. There's a tap on my shoulder,  '' Jo- '' Not Joe, some girls, I'm guessing fans, '' HI WERE YOUR BIGGEST FANS!!'' they all say at once. After about 15 minutes of picture taking were done. Just as they leaving I turn around  expecting to be done, I hear them all shout the same thing at me,  '' Jasper 4 eva!!!'' What's that mean?  Random. Whatever . I'll go and wait by the doors, hopefully he's here soon. I haven't eaten I like, three days, I just now realized I'm starving... After about 30 minutes of waiting I fall asleep.
