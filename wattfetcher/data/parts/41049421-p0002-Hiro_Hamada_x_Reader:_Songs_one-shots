"Hi GoGo, what's going on?" Honey Lemon asked.
"she walked away from me" GoGo frowned then people are eyes on her "Hiro, explanation. now"
"uhm, she told me that she liked me but..." his words cut off then he continued "I reject... her, I should've not appear on the date, this is all my fault" he facepalmed "I think I realize that I'm in love with (y/n)."
So I drive home alone.As I turn out the lightI'll put your picture downAnd maybe get some sleep tonight.
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitarThe only one who's got enough of me to break my heartHe's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
"Hiro, I will borrow this you, go talk to her" Tadashi put his phone on Hiro's hand and smiled. Hiro starts to run away from SFIT and went to your backyard, dialing your number.
"Tadashi?" you answered.
"(y/n), its me Hiro" you said as you're thinking about climbing to her bedroom "I just I want to tell you I'm sorry, I guess I'm overreacted"
"oh ok" you said. He start climbing on the tree until he reached the back terrace, which happens to be your bedroom "Saying those words to you was the biggest mistake in my whole life, and you know that"
He continued "(y/n), I broke up with her, I realize that you're always there for me since I met you but i still blame myself for this" he said as he tried to hold back the tears.
"that's the reason why you hold my hand?"
"Maybe...uhm because... I just want to tell you that... I love you, (y/n)" he confessed.
"huh?" you said as you stood up from your bed "i thought you-" he cut you off "I should've I confess my feelings for you in the first place, I'm still thinking about you while I'm dating her"
"Don't tell me you..." you realize that your bestfriend was in love with you "yeah, this is the reason why i broke up with her"
"wait, where in San Fransokyo are you?" you asked.
"turn around" you turn around as Hiro was in the outside of the back terrace, he hanged up as he open the door and walks over fast, grabbing your face and kissed you deeply. You gasp until you started to kissed back. Your arms around on his neck while his are around your waist tightly. You two did this in 5-10 minutes until you pulled it away, pressing each other's forehead.
"Honey Lemon wants you to come over" He informed.
"oh, it's her birthday, i'm sorry I forgot" he interwhined his hand with yours "I love you, (y/n)"
"I love you too, Hiro" you both smiled "can we tell them?" he asked and you nodded. His hand interwhined with yours again as you both went down and go out for Honey Lemon's birthday.
