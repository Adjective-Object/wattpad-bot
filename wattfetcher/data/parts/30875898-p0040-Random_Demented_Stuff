I stabbed myself with the pen that helped me for my last words
And now that I have them I can leave this world
I'm sorry to you that I just couldn't cope
I'm sorry that out of everything I gave you, you held on to the false hope
And I'm sorry that there's blood all over the floor
And I'm sorry that I had to lock all the doors
I was terrified that you would see it before I was done
I was terrified that you would walk in while I was loading the gun
But I realized something, this something is but a quote
We all deserve to leave on a final note
Mine just happens to be a suicide note
