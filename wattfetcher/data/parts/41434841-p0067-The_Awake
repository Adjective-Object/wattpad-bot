Lol ok I'm not healthy. We all get that. And I guess it doesn't look like I'm doing much to help myself out or get healthier or anything. But I am. I just can't do it all at once. And it's frustrating to me. I hate when things move slowly. And it's just ugh. I hate it. But at least I'm making an effort.
