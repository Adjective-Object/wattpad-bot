Jordan's POV
Erin and I... got a little... side tracked while editing the video.
"We - I uhh." She said with her eyes locked into mine. Trying to hold herself back and away from me, she put her arms out in front of her and shushed me? How does -- What? Just what? I don't understand her sometimes.
"Don't even try." I said as I rolled my chair up to her, hugging her and kissing the top of her head.
"Ooh, you smell good." I laughed.
"Hmm." She grunted.
"What?" I asked.
"Hmm." She grunted again.
"What are you doing?" I asked
"Hhmmm." She grunted for the third time.
"What the hell?" I asked
"No no no no, no no." She said
"Erin, what?" I chuckled.
She laughed and then stood up, turned and walked away from me.
"I -- " She started before laughing again.
"You what? What is wrong with you right now?" I asked with a smile.
"Oh, you are so wrong with me right now." She answered.
"I am so confused." I said.
"Oh yeah, you are." She said making me even more confused.
"Huh?" I asked before she walked over to me (finally). She grabbed my face and kissed me. "Oh, ok." I said while looking at her lips. "Just shut up already!" She screamed just before she kissed me again. "Oh, I get it now." I responded. "Shut up, Jordan!"
After we "edited the video", Erin and I sat at the desk and she said to leave the video how it was for now because she changed her mind.
"You changed your mind?" I asked.
"Yeah, yup." She responded.
"We're not telling them?"
"Not anymore." She said.
I can't believe that she wanted to one second and not the other.
"Sorry, I know you don't want this to be a secret." She said.
"Well it's kind of hard to keep it a secret, can't we at least post it on social media or something?" I asked.
"No, Jordan. Definitely not on social media because not everyone will see it." She answered.
"Well it's really difficult not to say something when we're filming, I slipped up once or twice already and I had to edit an entire minute or two out of the minecraft high stakes video and I'm sure everyone else did too." I said.
"Oh yeah, I edited that out before anything else." She answered.
