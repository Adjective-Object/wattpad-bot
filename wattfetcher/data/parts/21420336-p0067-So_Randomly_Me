Now every book has it's flaws.
Some have bigger flaws,Others have smaller flaws
Let's list some:
1) The main character always falls in love with either
- a person who she hated and they felt the same
- a person who is popular and she loved since the beginning
This just annoys me because I'm reading and it's like"And she looked at Brandon, who glared at her in return. How dare he look at her like that?!"
Me: ah fudge nuggets they're gonna date aren't they...
2) obvious story plots
- they meet a new person and someone suspects themTheir suspects are correctPerson betrays themComes back
- person lives horrible sucky lives that magically get fixed with love
That's just... Cruel
It's teaching people that anything can be fixed with love
Last time I checked, love hurts
3) When every character lives
gosh I feel bad for adding this as a flaw but if a book doesn't make me full of feels I do not like it.
It is like," OH CRABBY CAKES I JUST GOT RAN OVER BY A CAR BUT DO NOT WORRY BECAUSE I HAVE THE POWERS OF A GOD AND CAN MAGICALLY GET UP LIKE NOTHING!"
Ive done this in my books
but I do it on purpose to see who notices because its fucking hilarious
anyways thats enough
Im too tired XD
