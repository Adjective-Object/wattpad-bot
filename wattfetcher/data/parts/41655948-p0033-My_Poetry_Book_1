There's a side of me that listens to bubblegum pop while throwing glitter everywhere,
But there's a side of me that listens to all the undiscovered music and everything in between, who wears black and writes poetry, who is full of love to hate everything.
And only when I'm not having a glitter party do I realize how fake that is. In all honesty, I'd rather be the girl who writes her poetry.
