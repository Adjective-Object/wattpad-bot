There are some things in life that are just inevitable. The sun is going to come up. You are eventually going to die. Some people are going to hate you.
You know what else is inevitable? The freaking common cold.
As I write this, it feels like there are elephants in my nose, and it feels like I ate metal. My sleep was also extremely terrible last night.
Now, why I hate the Common Cold.
Seriously, who on earth would like suffering and feeling like they're gonna die? I sure as hell don't! Sure, it gets you out of school. Sure, you get to sleep all day. But that's if you fall asleep. Otherwise, you're bored for until your fever breaks/your nose magically unplugs itself/your throat heals. It sucks.
I realize this entry is short, and I apologize. Now I must go out and curl myself into a little ball of warmth.
