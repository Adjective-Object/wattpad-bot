" I Woke Up To The Sound Of Faint Knocking. They Werent Coming From My Room's Double Doors But Rather From My Window. At first, I Contemplated On Whether I Should Check Out What Was That Or Just Sleep Again Anyway. However, Just As I Was About To Place My Head On My Pillow, Small And Urgent Taps Sliced Through The Room From The Concealed Glass.
I Snapped My Neck To Which The Knocks Were Coming As My Eyes Tried To Whiz Through The Window's Blinds Helplessly.
Gripping Onto My Sheets, My Feet Slowly Touched The Floor, The Cold, Hard Material Creaking Lowly Beneath My Tiny Feet.
Slowly Approaching My Window, My Mind Went Into A Rush. Part Of Me Was Telling Me To Figure Out What This Was, Urging Me To Walk Faster. However, The Larger Part Of Me Told Me To Stay Away, Saying Things About It Being Unreal And Dangerous.
Knowing It Must Be Late At Midnight From The Lack Of Sunlight And My Darkened Room, I Couldnt Help The Negative Thoughts That Posessed My Head.
I Knew For a Fact That No One..No Creature Could Climb My Window Without A Ladder.
With Trembling Fingers And Thumping Heart, I Yanked The Blinds Up.
I Blinked Furiously, a Frown Curved Its Way On My Face. I felt My Heart Thumping Loudly, Missing A Beat Before A Loud Yelp Escaped My Lips.
A Hazy Smudge Of Condensation Layed There On My Window.
I Stumbled A Few Steps Backwards, Releasing The Blinds From My Hand As I Choked On A Sob.
Someone...Something..A Creature Out There Was Breathing On My Window, Watching Me Sleep.
Shaking My Head Vogiourously, I Rushed Into My Bathroom, Slamming The Door And Locking It Behind Me As I Tried To Control My Hysteria.
I Slid Down My Bathroom Door, My Hands Clutching At My Own Nightgown As The Knocks Outside Never Seemed To Cease.
I Was Quite Sure The Knockings Had Now Turned To Loud 'Thuds' And 'Crash's As They Could No Longer Be Heard From The Window.
Someone Is In My Room. Destroying it.
I Heard Shelves Collapsing, Glass Shattering And Loud Footsteps Stomping All Over My Room.
Tears Streamed Down My Cheeks As I Struggled To Control My Sobs.
