"Ash, You looked like you walked in on someone naked. What's wrong?" Cody asked laughing "Awkward eye contact with the new kid" I whispered.
Cody gasped dramatically "oh no!"
I rolled my eyes "Drama queen" "But i am the queen of this group" He said grinning. Tyler shook his head "More like bitch of this group" I laughed while Cody flicked him off.
Brice glance over again cracking a smile at what happened.
What the hell, stalker
I just ignored him and continued to talk with Tyler and Cody until the bell rang telling us to go to our next class.

This next class was my best class because i get to eat! Yay lunch!
Tyle, Cody, And I sat at our table, it was usually only us until Brice walked over shyly then asked "Could i possibly sit with you? There are no other spots.." His romanian accent went down and his voice sounded more confident now. I nodded saying "Sure" while Cody and Tyler looked around the room to prove his point wrong of no other seats.
What jerks..
Brice grinned a bit then sat down. I smiled slightly then said "I'm Ashton, this is Cody and that's Tyler." I gustured to the two and they waved like five year olds. "I'm Brice" He said waving back, "It's nice to meet you" He said politly. We nodde with smiles then looked at each other going "The fuck stop copying!" Brice chuckled a bit.
I think he likes us I thought with a smile.

Brice was a pretty fun guy really
