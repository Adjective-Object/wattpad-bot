"I know it's not the perfect time to say this, but we sent your papers to the school two weeks ago and they agreed, so you'll start school tomorrow" Mrs.Carter said
"UGGHHH CAN IT GET ANY WORSE" I screamed then everyone left
mind: you're stupid, I told you not to leave your family but you wanted to try something new, now enjoy being flirted by that stupid Damon
me: just shut up please shut up
I walked to the bathroom and did Wadou' then prayed Ishaa'
......
next morning
"AAAAAHHHHH" someone screamed in my ear and I fell off the bed
"BESMELLAAH"
"HAHAHA Y-Your face is is is priceless HAHHHA" Elina laughed
"shut up ! who wakes people up like that" I pushed her
"Blah blah blaaahhh .. now Get dressed school starts in 55 minutes" she said
"WHAAATTTTT" I accidently slipped and fell on the ground
"HAHAHAHA aaah I've never laughed like that before , now take a shower and get ready HAHAHHA" Elina continued laughing then walked out.
I took a quick shower then opened my make up bag ... which only contained sun blocks ... so I guess it's not a make up bag after all
knock knock .. "Who is it"
"Come on we're gonna be late"
"okay wait"
I pulled my blue maxi skirt and a peach blouse then I covered my head with a blue hijaab then took a look at the mirror
"as hot as always" I joked
mind: No
me: shut up
"STOP TALKING TO YOUR STUPID SELF WE NEED TO GO NOW" Elina screamd behind the door
"Okay Okay" I walked out
"woah! you look good" Elina's eyes got widened
" thank you , now we need to go"
.
.
.
We walked to the school which was only 20 minutes away
"Ready to get in" Elina asked me enthusiastically and I nodded.
"Besmellaah"
We walked hand in hand in the long corridors.
Everyone stared at me ... EVERYONE ..
But after two minutes I heard whistles ...
"What's Up chick? new ha, Need someone to show you around ?" a guy said but I ignored him
"Astaghferolah" I whsipered
"wohhooowwww, kiss me or kill me please" another one said
"Wanna hang out after school" the third one said
"Oh god I wanna go home" I whispered to Elina
"It's Okay they always do that when a new girl comes " she whispered back.
"Shut Up guys, She might shoot you" a girl said, she successfully caught my attention
"shut Up Miley" Elina said
