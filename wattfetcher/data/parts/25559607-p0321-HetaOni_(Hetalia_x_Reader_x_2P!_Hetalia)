Hmm...and what would that be?

Minutes later, Luciano still hasn't replied. I placed my phone beside my pillow. My hands were sweaty, so I wiped them off on my shirt. That's when I realised that I haven't really taken a bath in a while. Omg.


Well, since Luciano's taking his sweet time to reply, I might as well take a bath. Lifting the blanket off me and getting up from the bed, I brushed my disheveled hair a bit. Putting on my shoes and swinging my bag behind my shoulder, I made me way towards the 1Ps who were gathered around a long wooden table.


As soon as they saw me approaching them, they sort of...quieted down, or actually, stopped their whole discussion. I kinda felt a bit bad for disturbing them.


"Oh, uhm, don't mind me... I was just going to say that I was going to take a bath for a while. Just letting you know, just in case you look for me or something. Are all of the showers/tubs occupied?" I asked them shyly.


They were a bit silent for a while, when Japan looked at me and spoke, "No, I believe there's one or two available. Germany, Italy, and America are in there, but don't worry, there's a lock for each cubicle."


"Ah, thanks!" I smiled, heading for the bathroom.

As I was about to turn the knob of the bathroom door, it suddenly swung open from the other side.


"Ciao, bella!~" Italy said, greeting me with a hug.


I smiled. Well, at least he's in a good mood. "Hello, Italy. Just finished taking a bath?"


"Si! Germany, America and I are already done. You've got the whole place to yourself..." Italy told me. ".....That is, if you want me to accompany you~" he winked.


Giggling, I shook my head. He is definitely Italian. "No, thanks for the offer, though."



Behind him, Germany and America appeared. "Oh. Hallo, frau." Germany said.
