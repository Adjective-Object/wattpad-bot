Hi guys it's Claire!
I started an account on Instagram for making covers for wattpad users a little while ago.
Then I thought, "well why don't I put the covers I make on wattpad? That's where they're going!"
So here we are!
So if you would like me to make a cover for your story, you can comment on any part of this story or you can direct message me on Instagram (_coverswattpad).
I will be posting all the covers I have made and will be making here as well.
So comment er up if you would like one.
I've made all of my covers except Ups or Downs just in case you want to see my experience. But I have to say... those were not my best work. The cover of this book is a collage of some covers I've made that aren't posted yet. And in my opinion they are better.
So... you know what to do.
Talk to you later,
ClaireAKA cthanrahan
