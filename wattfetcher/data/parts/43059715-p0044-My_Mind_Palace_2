How did you come up with the username Tardiscat?
I'm ocd when it comes to usernames. They have to be capitalized and without underscores. Or numbers, if possible.
So I sit there for a long time, trying to think of something creative. I thought of my old Instagram user, SherlocksFez. I almost did that, but it didn't really... Click.
I wanted something with 'cat' in it because I love Warriors. So I started thinking of Doctor Who, then the Tardis. Then bam.
