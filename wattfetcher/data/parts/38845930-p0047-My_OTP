"Oh, Jordan. Really, you said it then?" She asked.
"Yeah, I did." I said shaking my head slightly.
"Do you remember when we first both said it?" She asked.
"Oh yeah, of course."
~~~Flashback to when they actually said it~~~
"Erin?" I said as I grabbed her and put my hands in the back pockets of her jeans.
"What?" She asked as she held her hands over mine.
"I love you." I said with fear in my eyes as she tried to kiss me, she paused and just looked at me and then she kissed the side of my mouth awkwardly when I turned away because she didn't respond as fast as I thought she would.
"Damn." She whispered under her breath.
"You missed." I said after looking in her beautiful green eyes.
"I wont miss this time." She said just before we leaned in to kiss each other. "I love you." She whispered.
~~~Flash forward to real time... again~~~
"That was the cutest thing ever." She said.
"I know, of course I know." I said.
We stood up out of our seats and kissed each other.
"You are amazing." She said.
"What?" I asked.
"What?" She asked recreating the time I said "I love you" without her hearing.
"What what, I'm amazing?" I asked.
"I didn't mean it, I mean I meant it, just not out loud."
"That was my favorite moment of that week." I said.
"It was pretty rude, you making fun of me... but I really loved it." She said while taking my hand.
"I wish you had your cast off." I said as I scratched her cast.
"Yeah, me too. It gets really sweaty and gross and I have to cover it with plastic whenever I take shower, its really inconvenient... thank you brain and lack of sleep." She said.
"I love you, Erin."
"I love you."
