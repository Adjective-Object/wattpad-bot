Nico and his little 12 year old sister were told by there faster parents that they were heading up to a place near the beach with their grandmother. Nico hates the idea of leaving his room and place where he was comfortable with to a place he has hardly been too. The only things he has to entertain himself with are books and his iPad. Not that he was going to use it anyways, maybe just sit somewhere quiet for 6 days or more of loneliness. His sister? She's got their half cousin to play with who is at the age of 6. But one day when they head off to the beach, Nico meets a boy who is somehow close to his grandmother. Then the bound forms there till the last day when Nico was told he was going back home. Was he going to break the guy's heart he just met and was the best friend he ever had?
