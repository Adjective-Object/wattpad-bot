"YA" they all yelled. I couldnt sleep. I had Bella on my mind.
How am I a 21 year old boy supposed to raise a 13 year old little girl.
Everyone else was a sleep.
"Cam why arent you sleeping" Nash asked sitting up.
"Im just thinking" I replied. "How am I supposed to raise a 13 year old little girl all by myself. I have to work, go to magcon, She has to go to dance 5 days a week, go to school, I have to cook for her, Clean" How am I going to do this Nash" I asked.
"Listen your not raising her alone, me and the guys are going to help you every day. I know how hard this must be on both of you, I couldnt imagine rasing Hayes or Skylynne all on my own, I promise that I will never leave you two alone, I love you both so so much, Raising a 13 year old girl is going to be REALLY tough and especially for her, Being raised by all us boys is going to be tough for her. But I promise that we will help you" Nash said to me hugging me.
"Nash this is why your my best friend, Thank you so much" I said.
"Now look at this, Who would have thought that my best friends little sister and my little brother would be a thing" Nash said.
"I know their cute" I said looking at them all cuddled up together.
