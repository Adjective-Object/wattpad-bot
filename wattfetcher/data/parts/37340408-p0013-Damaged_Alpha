"Why?"
He kisses me softly. "Because, I reject you as my mate."
The tears come, and I fall to the ground in pain.
"Why aren't you accepting my rejection? It'll hurt you."
I glare at him. Bastard. "Why..."
"Why aren't you..."
I'm sick of it. "Leave."
"Not until you accept-"
"Leave. Now," I say with finality on my tone.	He leaves and I feel the pain. I remember my father's words. My tough, tough father.	"Don't ever let your feelings show. If you show them you are the loser, and I didn't raise a loser like you."
I hear wolves howling as I black out.
Bastard didn't even say sorry.
