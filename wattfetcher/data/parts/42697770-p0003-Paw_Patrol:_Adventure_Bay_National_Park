"Ah found it, oh sorry Zuma" Rocky said as he jumped out his truck with a old piece of what looked like a metal plating of some kind
"Finally, we can fix this sign" Chase said wagging his tail
After the sign was fixed the three pups cheered at how good job they did, Ryder then arrived
"Wow! nice job on the sign pups, you are such good pups" Ryder said while throwing them each a treat
"Thanks Wyder" said Zuma as he finished his pup treat
"Yeah thanks" Both Chase and Rocky said at the same time
"Ok pups lets go see how the others are doing" Ryder smiled
At the rock-slide Rubble has almost completely removed all the rocks off the road, all that was left to fix was the safety railing.
Skye had gone to get some new railing. When the other pups and Ryder arrived
"Last one!" Rubble said as he removed the last rock from the road then he cheered
"Awesome job there mate!"
Rubble jumped to see Ranger Silvera standing there with some pup treats
"Oh hi Silvera, are those for me?" he asked
She giggled and said "Ryder told me how much you pups like them, so had my cook make some for you"
"Has anyone seen Marshall?" Ryder asked looking a bit concerned
"He's the black and white one right" another Ranger named Anna asked
"Yes have you seen him?" Ryder asked turning to Anna
"No sorry Ryder" Anna Replied
"Come to think of it, i haven't seen him" either Silvera added
"Same here" Chase Zuma, and Rocky said at the same time while looking around.
Marshall was missing, his fire truck was still parked near the cliff with its ladder up but Marshall was nowhere to be seen
