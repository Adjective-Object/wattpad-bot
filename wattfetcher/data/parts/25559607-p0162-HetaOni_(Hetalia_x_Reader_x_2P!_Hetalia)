She paused for a while and tried to recall the next numbers and continued,


"11...

....Uhmm....

....I think...I think I can still count some more!

Uh...26!!! Yeah, that's it. That's enough~"


The little girl uncovered her eyes and looked around. "Hmm? Where to start?~" She suddenly began running across the other hall. I was able to move now, so I followed her.


Room by room she checked, but to no avail. She couldn't find the person she was playing 'hide and seek' with. She almost gave up, when her eyes suddenly brightened, "AH! I know! I know! There's only one place left!!" She dashed into another corridor again. I was getting tired of running with her, but then I remembered--this was only a dream, anyway.



We ran up several flights of stairs. Man, even though I don't really get fatigued because this is just a dream, I still feel like I'm getting dizzy from all the running and stair climbing. While I was thinking to myself, the girl in front of me suddenly stopped.
