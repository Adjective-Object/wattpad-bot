The first kiss ... our first kiss, then her taking off her hijab, us going to clubs, her coming back to America, us staying at her house alone ... That's when we reached the worst.
The night ... the night that changed everything, I had to leave, it was so wrong but yet the best I could do, I hoped that she'd wake up, get back the way she was, but she got worse, she wanted revenge.
My blood boiled every time I saw her with Jake, every time out eyes met, she would kiss Jake or hug him to get me jealous, and she succeeded in it.
When she announced that I'd be a father, I left her again, I didn't know what to do, I also hoped that this news would pull her away from Jake and drinking, but it didn't.
The last card I had was Molly, my sister, the one that changed because of Leena, because of what Leena said a day before leaving to Jordan, I heard what she told Tom and Molly but acted like I did not. I begged Molly to talk to Leena but never told her why, "Just go see her and you'll know everything" I said to Molly.
And now, she's probably at that filthy boy's, Jake. I heard him talking to his friends, "I bet you that I'd get her tonight" Jake told Connor and two others, "We bet you to invite us so we can enjoy ourselves too" Connor said. I tried to prevent Leena from going but she didn't listen.
And now, I don't know if I should go save her from the shark's teeth or let her face the consequences of her latest actions.
......
Now what? What do you think?
