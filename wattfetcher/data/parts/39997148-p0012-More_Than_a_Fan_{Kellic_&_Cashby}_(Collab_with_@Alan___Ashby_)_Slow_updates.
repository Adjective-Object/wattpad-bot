"No, that's not me." I said, "I'm a relationship kind of guy."
"They're so time consuming though. I mean they don't last and they're so pointless." He ranted.
"Yeah but I don't know I like just being with that one person, they make me feel important and I like the company." I said and Austin looked around the bus.
"Didn't you and Johnny Craig used to have a thing together?"
"Uh yeah but it wasn't really serious."
"I thought you were a relationship kind of guy." He mocked and I rolled my eyes.
"That was a long time ago, and it was just a fling."
"Well I heard that he want's to get with you again." He said elbowing my side.
I shook my head, "It's too soon."
"But you could always fuck screw around or something."
"I don't know, he's not my type anymore." I said, "But who knows."
"Exactly, now I have a ginger to scope out, I'll talk to you later?"
"Totally." I said wanting to go get more to drink anyways.
"Oh and don't drink too much. I don't need throw up all over the bus like that other time."
I waved my hand at him in a dismal way, "I do what I want Carlile."
He rolled his eyes at me before walking off to find Alan again. I sighed and headed back to the bar and poured myself another cup of whiskey.
"Vic, Vic!" I looked over and saw Tony walking over, "You know you're great right?"
"Yeah I do," I laughed. "Why?"
"I just thought I'd tell you." He said, "Do you want to go smoke in the back?"
"Yeah, let's go." I said. He smiled at me and grabbed my arm pulling me out of the swarm of people and to the back lounge. "Who's all in here?"
"Tino, Phil, Mike, me, you and some kid."
"Oh." I said nodding, "The kid's name is Alan by the way." I said and took a seat next to my brother.
"Here." Mike said handing me a joint. I took it and smiled at him.
"Thanks bro."
"Anytime." He said and turned to Phil and Tino starting some conversation about only god knows what.   I sat back on the couch and took a deep inhale. I really needed this. A few minutes later someone else walked in the lounge and it was none other than Johnny who took a seat next to me smiling.
"Hey," He said smiling.
I sighed, I did not want to talk to him, "Hi."
"So, Austin told me you were talking about us." He said and put an arm around my shoulder but I shrugged it off.
"Yeah and?"
"I was just wondering if you wanted to start that back up?" He asked scooting closer to me.
"No, I don't." I told him.
"Why not?"
"Because I'm not interested in you or anyone so just screw off."
"Oh come on Vic! I heard what happened between you and Cara, maybe we could have some fun on tour." He said suggestively. "Remember how much fun we had making Isles and Glaciers together?"
