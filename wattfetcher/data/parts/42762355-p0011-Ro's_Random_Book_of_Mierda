And I am 180â‚¬ richer! I have enough money to survive a year... Next year I'll get a job anyways, so I'll get some money from that as well. Money is important...
//I finally have to admit that I'm a lot like the Netherlands... Don't fuck with my money or flowers or siblings or drugs, okay? Or my fucking fish.//
There wasn't as many visitors as usually, since people are traveling. There was two grandmothers, four uncles, two aunts, four cousins and four other relatives. My other godmother will come over next week with her four kids and husband.
And I ate so much fucking carrot cake!
Tomorrow I'm leaving to Johanna's and will be there for most of the week. On Sunday we leave to Latvia.
