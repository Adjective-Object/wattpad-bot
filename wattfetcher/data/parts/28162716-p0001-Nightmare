Life sucks a Hell lot
even if there are ups the downs almost always the way out is good.You know that already,Now lets get to the things you don't know like my name is Star short for Starglass yeah I know not a normal name but I am not your average normal kid.
I live with a lady named Abby and I am 14 almost 15  in 2 months even though I don't feel like it anyway.I just got given up by both my parents and now I have to move all the way to New York. Life dosen't feel real, only like a empty never ending void with a sole survivor.I have red hair cut down to my ears and am 5ft tall with skinnky body and a long scar on my right arm that is almost invisable with my olivly skin, I also have dark brown eyes.
Then a voice I recognize all to well wakes me from myself.
''Miss Storm'' said Mr White ''I am in your home?
''No sir'' I say
''Then no sleeping in my class'' says Mr White, is a man with white hair, short height but looks young besides his hair and his white glasses.
Every one laughs and gives me those served you right looks.I wish I could make their looks disappear and then we will see who is laughing then. I smile at that thought.
''I wasn't sleeping'' I mumble
''Then maybe you want to take it up with the Principal Miss Storm'' He taunts back
Any thing but this boring class room I thought.
Mr White is still waiting for an answer.
''I will try not to sleep through such an important lesson'' I say with coldness in my voice
He turns around like that was enough for him, only if I could tell him how I really felt.I seek out my phone and see a text:
''Come on already operation ''Escape'' or not'' says Henry, my best and only friend
''Operation ''Escape'' a go'' I text back
A few minutes later the fire alarm goes off. I smile, Henry succeeded as always.I grab my bag and jump out the window before some one could see me.
Henry is leaning against an old oak his short light brown hair blowning in the wind, he is about the same height as me and the same age but he has beautiful light brown eyes.He is wearing a blue shirt with the Broncos on it with black jeans that make the muscles in his legs show.
''Come on lets go.....Any thing you want to say before we leave for good'' Asks Henry
''Yeah sorry but I had no choose''
''Lets go'' I say
'' YES'' shouts Hen
I bump him in the ribs.
''Wat don't tell me your not excited to be rid of this place''
''I am I just don't want them to know where we are''
''Now move it'' I finish
