Hello Readers, Thank you so much for trying out my book I'm open for any ideas or suggestions--Mads:)

"Beep...Beep...Beep" I turn my head and glance at the clock, it reads 8:00 am.
"Maya" I hear a yell from downstairs
Maybe if we ignore him, he will let us sleep longer. My wolf, Pearl grumbles in my head.
Come on lets at least see if it is important, I say back to her.
I hopped out of bed and walked towards my bathroom connected to my bedroom. I wash my face and brush my teeth then skip over to my closet. Right now was fall, my favorite, so I slip on some old jeans and a grey sweater that matched my eyes a little. I then headed to my door but first glanced myself over in the mirror by my door way. I was tall, athletically built thanks to my father being third in command and the head trainer at our pack. My eyes were mainly blue with hints of green that I got from my mother . My long blonde hair was braided to keep it out of my face as I left my room to go downstairs.
I walk to the kitchen when I hear evidence of a person, " Hey Dad" I say as I enter the room and see my dad making some scrambled eggs.
"Good morning Princess, Eggs?"
"Yes please." I grab a stool near by and sit across from the stove. "Dad I know you said you would think about it but-"
"Your right I did say that and I also said that I needed to speak to Alpha Will before you can come to a pack meeting." he said cutting me off.
"Fine" I say dismissing the subject
" I'm sorry to snap at you sweetie its just that pack is dangerous and I don't know if I want your first pack meeting to be with that pack."
Its hard to stay mad at my father because I know he is right, the Dark storm pack may not be the best pack for me to meet first because of how dangerous they are. I heard that the old alpha was challenged by his son and the son ripped his throat out without even flinching. Every pack out there fears him, but if I don't start somewhere how will I ever get out and see the world.
"Please at least ask Alpha will for me" I plead
my father sighs knowing I will not let this go anytime soon "Ok I will try, but no promises"
"Thanks dad" I smile and give him a hug knowing that was a difficult choice for him to make. We then spent the rest of the morning eating our eggs and getting ready to head out to the training grounds where I spent most of my time growing up.

Around 3:30pm at the training fields
"I almost had you, you have got to teach me that move sometime" my best friend Lilly, and Alpha Will's daughter, says to me as I help her up off the arena floor.
"If I did teach it too you I would never beat you" I laugh. Lilly and I are very similar skill wise, her dad always wants her training so she can be prepared for anything.
"Rematch?" I question her with a smirk appearing on my face knowing she would not turn me down. Lilly has been my best friend since we were born around the same time. She was the most kind hearted person I know and she would make a great leader one day.
" Your on, but this time you will not win" she smiles right before she makes the first move.
