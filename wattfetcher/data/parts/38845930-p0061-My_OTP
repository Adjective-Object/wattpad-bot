"Then why do you keep saying it?" She asked.
"Because it's true and if I don't keep reminding you, you might forget." I said.
"I love you, and I will never forget you love me too." She said.
"That is quite true, isn't it?" Lisa said looking at her hubby smiling.
"Very." He said.
"Oh, sorry. Jordan, this is Greg." Erin said.
"Hi, very nice to meet you." He said shaking my hand.
"Nice to meet you too." I said nodding my head.
We had a very long conversation about accountant's and stuff, super boring stuff... luckily it got interupted by the end of the party.
"Thank you mommy." Boo said rubbing her eyes and walking over.
"You're welcome." Erin said picking her up.
"Are you tired?" I asked.
"Yeah." She said reaching for me.
"You're getting heavy... and you're seven now?" I asked.
"Yeah."
"You are not seven, I don't believe you." Erin said.
"I am... seven years old already?" She asked.
"Wow yeah. Happy birthday, kid." I said.
"Am I really that old?" Erin asked.
"I am old too." Boo said.
"I'm am thirty?" Erin asked.
"Almost... you are almost thirty." I said.
"I'm so old, Jordan." She said pretending to stumble into me.
"You are not old." Boo said.
"You are seven. My child is a seven year old, that means I will be thirty -- I'm not thirty." She said.
"You're close to it." I said.
"I really am... so old." She said.
We drove home and I went straight the the fridge.
"Are you really that hungry?" Erin asked.
"I ate once today... at breakfast. It is five o'clock, I am starving." I said.
"I'm pretty hungry myself." She said.
"I have some pizza left over from last night we can have." I said.
"Sounds delicious."
