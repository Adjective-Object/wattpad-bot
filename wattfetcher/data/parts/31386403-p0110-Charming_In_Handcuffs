Jack did show me this video I didn't believe existed. And I couldn't stop laughing through out the whole fifteen minutes of it. He had to be at least three or four and that made it even funnier. It did make me forget about how complicated everything was for a few minutes.

Hilarious.
I did want to read the letter. I was nervous about it. I didn't know what he had to say. Hopefully nothing bad, but I don't think I had to worry about that. I wanted to wait until tomorrow when I'll be able to read it alone. I didn't tell Jack about the letter yet. I wanted to wait and read it before I spoke about it to anyone, including my grandparents. I don't know how my grandma is going to feel about it. I already know how my grandpa will.
After spending hours watching Jack's home videos, we went up to his room again. I actually appeared in maybe two of the videos from Jack's fifth birthday party. That was when we were kind of friends. Not great friends, but still friends nonetheless.
Jack lent me another shirt, seeing as though he can trust me not to run off with another one. But no promises about that.
We curled under his blankets and huddled together like we have before, "Don't leave without waking me up."He mumbled against the side of my head.
"I don't plan on getting up before you." I replied.
He snuggled closer and exhaled, "Good."
And we fell asleep.

I didn't know what time it was when I heard Jack gasping for air beside me.

Finally an update! I said they're going to be slowly now sadly because I have summer classes. I don't know why I thought it was a good idea, lol.

The next chapter will be a surprise!!! And I'm sure you can guess why, haha.
Let me know what you guys think? :)
You're all so great and I love you to pieces!
