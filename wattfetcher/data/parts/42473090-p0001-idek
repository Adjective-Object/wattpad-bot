Mirror , mirror on my wall .. I just want to be thin , pretty nd tall
Mirror , mirror .. If I change my hair , maybe someone will start to care ?
Mirror , mirror .. If I starve myself , at least I'll be beautiful , forget my health
Mirror , mirror .. If I cut my wrist , will I feel like I exist ?
Mirror , mirror .. Don't you see , what you show is ruining meh ..
