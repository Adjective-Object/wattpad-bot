An Huge Pain Stabbed My Heart And Lungs Ruthlessly As I Struggled To Breath In.
I Was Having One Of My Anxiety Attacks Again.
My Eyes Stinged Painfully Befpre Rivers Of Tears Flowed Down My Cheeks As The Unbearable Pain Over-whelmed My Senses.
My Eyes Blurred And My Chest Felt Like It's Going To Blow Up Any Second Now. My Lungs Burned Aching For Oxygen As My Hands Were nearly Clawing At My Throat.
Suddenly, Three Urgent Taps Sounded at My bathroom Door, Before Dad's Concerned Sound Slipped Through.
"Bree ? You In there ?"
"Y-yes" I Replied But My Voice Barely Reached Above a Whisper.
"Bree, Open The Door ! LET ME IN." Dad Yelled, Pounding On The Door And Fiddling With The Door Knob.
Damn it, I Forgot I Have Locked The Door.
Struggling To Stand On My Feet, My Hands Still Clutching Onto My Heart, My Feet Shuffled On The Cold, Hard Tiles As I Used One Of My hands To Hold Me up Against The Wall.
"Bree, If You Aint Opening That Door Right Now, Im Going To Have To Break It Down.."
I Shuffled Closer.
"Do You Hear Me ?"
"I Think She Blacked Out." A Small Voice Whispered Outside. It Was Familiar But My Mind Was Too Worked Up To Recognise The Voice Anyway.
Reaching For The Knob, I Turned It Around Slowly. Among Hearing The Click Sound, I Pulled The Door Open, Before Collapsing On The Floor.
I Think I Blacked Out For A Minuite Or Something Because When I Opened My Eyes, Dad's Arms Were Wrapped Around Me Protectively As He Craddled My Head Onto His Shoulders.
"I-im S-so S-scared, H-he Almost G-got T-to Me-e." I Cried, Sobs Racking My Body.
His Arms Wrapped Around Me Tighter, Whispering Soothing Words Into My Ears As Our Bodies Racked Back And Forth.
His Hands Hands Travelled up and Down My Spine In A Soothing Manner And Soon My Anxiety Attack Was Long Forgotten.
Tears Were No Longer Streaming Down My Cheeks And My Heart Was Beating Evely Again. My Body May Have Calmed Down and Stopped Trembling but The Fear Inside Of My Soul And Mind could Not Be Forgotten.
"Did You Catch Him ?" I asked, The words Slipping From My Mouth Involountary.
Suddenly, Dad Stopped Moving. Silence Enveloped The Atmosphere As He Seemed To Refuse To Answer My Question.
I Pulled Away From His Shoulders, Staring At His Occean Blue Eyes, A Frown Making its Way On My Eyebrows.
And Then His Lips Moved Muttering The Words I Never Wanted To Hear The Most.
"But There Was No One From The Start." "
...
"So, Is It True ? No One Was Really There ?" He Asked Skeptically, Adjusting The Glasses On His Nose.
"Yes." Brianna Replied In A Monotone Voice.
"What Made You Believe So ?" He Asked Again, Staring At Her Through The Thin Glass Of His Glasses.
"You Said, He Destroyed Your Room, there Must've Been Some Damage Still Evident, Right ?" He Continued.
"Yes, But Surprisingly, It Was The Same..Meaning No One Was there From The Start." She Replied Back, Quoting Her Dad's Words.
