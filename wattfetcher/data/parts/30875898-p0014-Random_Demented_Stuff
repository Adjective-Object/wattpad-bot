Dear Valentine's Day,
I hate you with ever fiber of my being. You have caused me pain, tears, screams, arguments, losses of loved ones, and a shattered fucking heart. Thank you, because I need that in my life right now.
My girlfriend, and my best friend committed suicide on this day. My other best friend relapsed and is going back the mental hospital, where we met, on this day. In that same day, I relapsed after being four month clean of self harm. Now I'm fucking contemplating taking my own life just to end this god damn pain.
It makes sense that all of this happened on Valentine's day, it was the day after Friday the 13th. Funny I was born the day after Friday the 13th. Guess my entire life revolves around Freddy Krueger, apparently.
So, yeah, done ranting about how much I hate Valentine's day. Fuck everything that has to do with that holiday!!! I hate it I'm never celebrating it again, ever. Um... Yeah, so, thanks for reading I guess. Fuck you Valentine's day.
Sincerely,
Shy Valentine
P.S- Of course my last is Valentine. Life has to taunt me with stuff like this.
