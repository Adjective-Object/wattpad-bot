"Have some manners!" Aya shouted.
"Well its quite a simple job." The Princess started." By the way, my name is Princess Twilight and I ate the Inu Inu no mi. (Dog Dog Fruit) Model: Yorkshire Terrier."
"Nice to meet ya." Sakura greeted bowing, still eating candy canes.
"I see. That's why you're so cute." Aya awed patting the Princess' head causing her tail to wag.
In a comforable palace room, the trio was surrounded by banana guards and being served by maids with a lollipop head.
"The job is quite simple. I fear that something bad may happen at the ceremony." Twilight expressed worriedly.
"Then why not contact the World Government?" Aya asked not noticing the face her friend was making.
"I don't want to bother them and besides its just a suspicion." Twilight stated.
"So what's the reward?"
"Har-"
"200 million beli."
"Really?" Sakura and Haruka exclaimed sparkling.
"Get yourselves together."
"Nee-chan, are you in here?" Another female voice asked.
"Yes, come in." Twilight answered in her sweet soft voice. From the door emerged tow figures. One was an average-height boy with messy blue hair and the other was a girl with orange-yellowish hair.
"Ah, Gemi-nii, Sayo-nee. These are our guests. That's Haruka, Sakura and Aya."
"Hi."
"Yo."
"What's up?"
"What are these low-lives doing here?" The blue sibling, Gemi, hissed.
"Low-lives?" Sakura repeated.
"Who the hell you calling a low-life?" Haruka yelled standing up ready to attack.
"Haruka, stop it." Aya stated firmly holding Haruka down.
"See, Twilight. These low-lives doesn't know what it means to be in the presence of royalty and they must be thrown out. Guards!" Sayo, the orange-yellowish sibling ordered.
"Stop it!" Twilight barked and a very powerful soundwave bounced against the walls and reaching poor Sakura's ears.
"My ears." Sakura hissed covering them.
"All of you stop it. I hired them. They are my personal bodyguards." Twilight answered pointing to them.
"You hired your own bodyguards!" Gemi said.
"Something is up." Aya noted and the rest nodded
After a few minutes of convincing the two siblings left and Twilight returned to her clients.
"I'm so sorry. We haven't had guests for a while."
"I see."
"Okay, I bet that you all are tired. I'll show you to the guest rooms."
In the Guest Room....
The guest room was spacious room with three beds and two bathrooms. There is also a large window which gives a view of the city and the famous Fudge Mountains.
"The view is amazing!" Sakura awed as she saw the flickering lights of the city.
