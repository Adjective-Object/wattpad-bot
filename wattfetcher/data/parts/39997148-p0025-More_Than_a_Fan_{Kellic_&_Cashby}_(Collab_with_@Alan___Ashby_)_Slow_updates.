The three in the bunks all got out sluggishly and I had to hold back an aw when I saw Alan come out with his hair all messed up and he was rubbing his eyes tiredly.
"I thought you were working on a paper?"
He yawned, "I was but I fell asleep halfway through it." He mumbled, "Come with me, I'm buying a coffee."
"Okay then."
He smiled and reached into his bunk grabbing his wallet out and his phone.
"Ready?" I asked waiting for him to get to the door.
"I think so." He said opening up the door and walking out.
"Alright then, let's go get you some disgusting gas station coffee." I said following him out the door. He nodded and we walked inside to where the coffee was.
"You want one or?"
"Nope, I think I'm just going to get me a monster or something." I told him.
"Okay sounds good to me." He said and started to pour himself a cup of the gross looking coffee that sorta came out like mud almost. I made a face and went to the refrigerator thing where they kept the monsters and grabbed two. One for now and one for the road.
"Ready to go?" Alan asked finding me again.
"Yeah, let's go." I said.
We walked up to the counter and I set my things down as did Alan.
"Are these together or separate?" The clerk asked.
"Together." I told her.
"Austin I ca-"
"No, its fine." I said and handed the clerk the money after she rang everything up.
"I could have paid for my own." Alan mumbled as we walked back to the bus.
"No, no its fine. Really."
"Are you sure? I can pay you back if you want." He offered pulling his wallet out.
"Nope, stop it." I said and opened the door to the bus for him. He gave me a grateful smile and walked inside.
"Thanks again. I'll be in my bunk if anyone needs me or something."
"Alright, have fun finishing your paper."
He smiled and walked off back to his bunk. I looked around at all the other guys and sat next to Phil elbowing him in the ribs.
"So how was your beauty sleep?"
"Disrupted by you." He muttered glaring at me.
"You needed to get up, besides too much sleep will fuck up your sleep schedule." I told him giving him a cheeky smile.
"Touring alone fucks up my sleeping schedule."
"Aw poor you, isn't the life of a rock star a terrible one?" Aaron said and gave him a pout.
He rolled his eyes, "I'm going back to bed now." He got up and walked back to the bunks.
"You need to be out here young man!" I called after him, "Come spend some quality time with your band."
"Fuck you Austin!"
"No I'm good you're not my type!" I called after him.
"Whatever asshole!"
I just laughed.
Eventually Tino came back on the bus and the bus began moving again. Thankfully this hour went by quickly and we were showing up at the venue.
