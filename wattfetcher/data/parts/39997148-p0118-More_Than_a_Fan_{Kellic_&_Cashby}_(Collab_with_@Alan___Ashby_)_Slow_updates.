"Hey are you okay?" Someone asked and I looked up to find Kellin staring down at me curiously.
"No. Alan broke up with me."
"What happened?" He asked me sitting down next to me.
"H-He told me we never had time for each other a-and his feelings were confused. He thought i-it was for the b-best but I don't think s-so. I really liked him."
"I know you did and he's just being an idiot right now. Hopefully he'll figure things out before he fucks it all up even more."
"Is there s-someone else? Was I-I not enough for h-him? I don't get it."
Kellin bit his lip and stayed quiet for a couple of seconds, "Before I say anything none of this is your fault from what he's told me and what I've seen you've been the best boyfriend he has ever had."
"Really?" I asked getting teary eyed.
"Yeah really, but he just got out of a three year relationship with an abusive asshole who he got stuck having to work with on an assignment and now he's questioning everything because who knows what that dick has been telling him."
"H-He likes Roy a-again?"
"I don't think so, more like he thinks he loves him. Roy is manipulating him just like he did before."
"I c-can't let him do that to h-himself." I said getting up, "I gotta talk to him."
"Just give him some space and he'll figure it out." Kellin said grabbing my arm, "You can't reason with him right now. He won't listen to anything you say."
"But I can try."
"Look, I've been friends with Alan for a while now just let him cool off and figure some things out before you say anything."
I sighed, "Okay. I'll give him some space."
"Good, now look at me," He said and when I did he grabbed my face and smashed it. "Just stay chill and I'm gonna talk to Alan."
"But you said to-"
"I said you shouldn't talk to him. I'm his best friend I can do whatever the fuck I want." He said and let go of my face.
"Kel-"
"Shut it. I'm gonna go talk to him." He said and left me against the wall.
I sighed and hit my head against the wall, I really hope Alan listens to whatever Kellin tells him. He can't go back to Roy, he just can't.  I sat there until the end of Pierce's sound check which is when I ended up leaving the venue.
The concert didn't start for another hour so I had some time before I had to go back.  So I ended just going on a walk to clear my head.  I walked around the city for that whole hour before going back.  I went into the back entrance and ended up running into Kellin who had a couple of  boxes in his hands which were now on the floor.
"Oh shit. I'm sorry." I said helping him pick up the shirts that fell from the box.
He sighed, "It's fine don't worry about it."
"Is h-he here?"
"Yeah but he doesn't really want to talk to you right now."
"Okay. How did it go earlier?"
"Fine."
"D-did he call Roy or anything?"
"No, he was just crying and apologizing but he needs space right now Austin."
