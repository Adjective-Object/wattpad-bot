This, thing took so long to make, but it came out nice.  Here you go Aura, make you some fanart, because, why not? The eyes are beautiful, but they were a pain. XD This is a sample to show you guys how well I can draw digitally, so maybe you would want some of your own. Remember, request are open!
Time: Like, 5 FREAKIN' HOURS. (So worth it for a talented writer and a good interweb friend :>)
