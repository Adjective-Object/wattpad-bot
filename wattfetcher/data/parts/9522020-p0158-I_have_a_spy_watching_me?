She turned towards my direction and became very angry. I smiled apologetically.
"Oh look at the time! Justin we have to leave! NOW!" I yelled as I started to run inside.
"I don't think so! You get your ass over here you..." That's when she spat insult after insult as I ran out to my car. I ran and ran, round and round. Justin eventually came out as Kiera did and her eyes fell on the girl chasing after me. She just laughed.
"Justin! Use your charm! Do something!" I yelled as I hid behind my sister using her as a human sheild.
"Okay, wait, who are you and what did Morse do to you?" Justin asked holding onto her shoulders to make sure she doesn't do anything to me.
"He spilt water all over me and it revealed everything! I was wearing white that day and he spilt water all over me! I was so embarrassed!" She said.
"Hey! I tried to offer you my coat and some money! It was all an accident!" I said.
"YOU ALSO SPILT FOOD ON ME RIGHT AFTER THAT!" She yelled as Jaycie came over and whacked my head.
"OWE!"
"I'm sorry that, that happened Olivia, but Morse is a nice guy when you get to know him. How about he makes you your favorite food?" She offered.
"What! No! I'm not cooking for this..." That's when Jaycie covered my mouth.
"He will do it unless he wants a certain day to get out to his mother." She said.
My eyes widened at that threat.
'You said you wouldn't!' I thought to her. She just grinned.
'I said I wouldn't, but you can't boss Tania or Link around, now can ya?' She linked back.
I grumbled at that and started to cross my arms.
"He can cook?" Olivia asked.
"He actually is a great cook." Justin said.
She seemed uncertain, but she nodded.
"At my house tonight. My parents are out of town. Come by my house at 6:00. We can check if I have the right ingrediants at my house." She said with her arms crossed.
"What am I making?" I asked a bit reluctantly.
"You will be making..." She paused to think about it.
"Why don't you make him make you Baked Potatoes and steak. He can do that. He can also make you brownies." Jaycie said and I glared at her.
"Fine." She said.
"Did you just set my sister on a reluctant date?" Jake ased.
"NO!" Olivia and I yelled with a disgusted face.
"I will not date him." She said. Making me agree.
The only thing that was weird was that Gold eyes was down here and said something to me.
"I wouldn't let her say that if I were you and you knew what I knew." He said and put his arm around Jaycie. "Lets go inside and eat. Now shall we?"
