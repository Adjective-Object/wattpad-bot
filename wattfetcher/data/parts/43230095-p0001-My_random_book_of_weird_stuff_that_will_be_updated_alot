Randomness comes from the heart. It's the air we breath, the stuff we eat and the noodles we cheese.
Me myself like randomness. It is better for the soul. I don't like order so you can probably tell I'm not a school kid.
But back to randomness.
Ok so how many of you randomly record one of your parents snoring like really load.
Well I have. We were fishing one night and Mom and me went bak to the car. And soon she was asleep and snoring like no tomorrow.
I turned on the radio trying to ground her out but it didn't work so I kept turning it up and she kept getting loader.
So I got out my phone and tur ed off the music and started to recored her.
And when I got about a minute and twenty seconds I stopped it and then put the phone to her ear and sent it back her way.
She jumped up super fast and was swatting at me.
I was dying laughing in the passengers seat.
After she was done having a heart attck she gave me this big long speech which I don't remember most of it.
And so Random acts of waking parents can be fun!
