"Yeah we are actually." I said, "We're going to need a new merch manager too now."
"Oh damn." Â Austin muttered.
"Yeah, you guys can sit down if you want." I offered gesturing to the now empty couch.
Austin sat down and gestured for Alan to sit next to him.
"I have a friend that could be your merch guy if you want." Alan offered.
"Really?" Jaime said, "That's great."
"Yeah, I could give him a call right now."
"Is he good with numbers and stuff? Because they have a lot of adding and shit to do." He said.
"Yeah the kids a math genius."
"Great! Vic what do you think?"
I shrugged, "Give him a call dude."
"I will." He said getting up and leaving to call.
"So what exactly happened?" Austin asked leaning back in his seat.
"She's a cheating bitch." I muttered.
"And?"
"And apparently it's been going on for a while now and Ross isn't the only one she's cheated on me with."
"Are you serious? I told she was a bitch."
I rolled my eyes, "Yeah everyone told me. I just thought she was better than that."
"Well obviously she's not."
"Yeah obviously." I said chuckling a little.
"I'm just glad she's gone, she was annoying as hell." Jaime said just as Alan came back in the room, "So can he do it?"
"Yeah, he said he'd meet up with us at the first stop."
"Awesome." I said feeling a little better. "What's his name by the way?"
"Kellin." He said, "Kellin Quinn and I'm just warning you he's a little... eccentric."
"As long as he can do that job right. I don't care what he's like."
"Yeah he'll be able to do it. It's right up his alley." He told us.
"Good."
"So Austin, ready to see how awesome it is being on tour with Pierce?" Jaime asked and poured him a glass of wine.
"Yeah, its gonna be fucking amazing. I just know it."
I scoffed, "Of course it's going to be amazing, you're touring with the coolest band around."
"Don't get ahead of yourself. Touring with Bring me was pretty great."
"We're better, no one parties like us." Jaime said.
"I know that. Partying with you guys is always fun."
"Of course it is." I told them, "Anyways I've gotta go tell the guys about the new merch manager." I said and headed to the door.
"We should get back to the guys anyway." He said getting up with Alan, "See you later for the kick off party right?"
"Yeah totally." I said letting them out of the room and looked back at Jaime who was finishing his wine. "No trashing the room Hime.
"I'll do my best." He called as I started to leave, "No promises though."
