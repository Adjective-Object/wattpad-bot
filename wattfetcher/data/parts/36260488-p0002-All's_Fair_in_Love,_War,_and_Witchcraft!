Finally everyone finished without any more accidents. I began to walk out when someone gently grabbed my hand. I turned surprised to see it was Geo. He pulled me to a corner far from the door. "Thanks I don't know what you did but thanks." He said. I blushed avoiding eye contact. "I....um.. I don't know what your talking about." I stuttered. "You know what I'm talking about my 'quick recovery'. Its okay you have your secrets we all do. Anyways I have to go. See ya at school. Alice right?" He said. I nodded still avoiding his eyes. With that he ran off. As soon as I thought he was out of sight I breathed a sigh of relief.
I strided beside Adreana. "So what was that about?" She said not looking at me. "What do you mean?" I asked nervous. "You and 'that boy' what's was that about?"
"Nothing"
"Are hiding something from me?"
"No"
"Than what was that about?"
"He was just thanking me for the paper towels."
"Whatever." She said turning towards her street. I kept walking straight. Well this year should be exciting.
