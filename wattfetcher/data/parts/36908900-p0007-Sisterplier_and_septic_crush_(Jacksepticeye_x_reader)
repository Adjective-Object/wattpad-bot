Mark's POV
Jack turns to his sister Victoria and asks if she can help with a bit of cash as he and I sell the recording equipment. "Really you both are selling the equipment?" Jack nods "Whatever will get back Y/n right" She nods "True i will help by going to the bank!" she grabs her jacket and keys, then runs out the door. Jack and I head to my place to grab my equipment we both post on twitter saying we wont be able to post videos we just sold our recording equipment most Subscribers were upset others told us to come back once we bought new ones. Me and Jack both made at least $2,500 (Yah i know wouldn't really be that much go with it!!) We met up with Victoria and she brought at least 2,000 "All we need is $500!!" Jack yells being excited we ran outside to see my friend Genevieve "Hey!" i said as i grab her hand, i hear Victoria mumble something like 'Bitch...' i brush it off Genevieve hugs me "I heard what happened" she looks at me with sympathy "Need any help Babe?!" she smiles her cute smile "Yah actually we need $500 do you have any cash on you" she pulls her wallet out and hands me $500 "You owe me!" She winks at me and laughs "Stop being lovey dovey and lets go!" Victoria says and grabs my hand dragging me away.
