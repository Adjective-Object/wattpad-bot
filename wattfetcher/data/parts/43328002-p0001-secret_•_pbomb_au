Parker sat on his computer, his eyes focused on the screen. He was playing Survival Games with Liam, his friend.
He sighed as he heard a knock on his door, he paused the recording and took of his headset.
His mother walked in, a sad expression held on her face. Parker stood up and walked over to her.
"What's wrong, mom?" Parker asked, watching his mother breakdown in front of him.
"Your father, he got hit by a bus, and he has passed away." She explained. Parker felt tears dribble down his cheeks as he listened.
"But that's not all, Parks. I lost my job, and I don't have enough money to pay off every month." She cries to her son, letting all her emotions out.
"I'm not going to Vidcon, then. I refuse to leave you here alone with nothing, what if something terrible happens?"
"No, Parker. I've got enough food and water for one week. I'm not going to spoil your fun."
Parker sighed as his mother exited, leaving him broken in tears.
"Parker, Parker! What's up bud?" He heard Liam's faint echoes from his headset fill the room.
Parker sat back down in his chair and put the headset back on.
"Liam, my family is dying." Parker said, tears still escaping from his eyes.
He saw Liam's pixelated face change colour from the Skype call.
"I'm so sorry, Parker." Liam said, tearing up. Liam hated seeing his best friend cry.
Parker sighed as he stared at his phone, Twitter notifications popped up, about how excited they were to meet him at Vidcon.
He just turned off his phone entirely, annoyed, then ended the Skype call to Liam.
Liam didn't bother calling him back, he knew Parker wanted to be alone.
Parker collapsed onto his bed, crying his eyes out. He grabbed a pillow, squeezing it tight to his chest.
"Why me?" Parker told himself.
"Why me?"
