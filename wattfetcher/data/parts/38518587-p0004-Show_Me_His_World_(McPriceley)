"So we were thinking, you could spend a week shadowing a Broadway actor. Do what they do, go where they go, that kind of thing. You could attend rehearsals and shows and public events then write about them from an insider's perspective." Arnold said.
"Who would I shadow?" Kevin asked.
"We're working on it." Thomas replied.
Kevin thought back to the actors he read about last night and made a suggestion. "How about that Sierra Boggess girl? A feisty redhead. Or Julia Udine, yeah she'll do."
"Kevin we were thinking-" Arnold started to speak but Kevin interrupted him.
"I got it, I've got it! That girl from those singing high school movies, what's her name?"
"Vanessa Hudgens!" Thomas exclaimed.
Kevin pointed at Thomas and snapped his fingers. "That's the one! Naba give Thomas a raise!" He exclaimed. Sitting on a couch in the corner of Kevin's office, taking notes, Naba rolled her eyes.
"No actresses want to help you!" Arnold cried, tired of being ignored. Kevin's smile faded and he glared at Arnold challengingly.
"Run that by me again?" He said icily.
"I made calls already, no actress wants to let you follow them around; they all think you're a playboy douchebag." Arnold said.
In her corner, Naba scoffed. "Well they aren't wrong." She muttered.
Thomas decided to jump in and relieve his anxious partner. "To be perfectly honest, Mr. Price, nobody wants to help you. We offered money an hour or two ago so we'll let you know if anyone takes the sweetened offer." He said.
"Keep me posted then." Kevin said, dismissing everyone from his office.
When he was alone, Kevin opened up his laptop and began typing furiously. What better way to start his article then by showing everyone how unwelcoming Broadway was to him?
