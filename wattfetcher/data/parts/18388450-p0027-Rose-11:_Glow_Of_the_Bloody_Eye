The door to the basement opened but I could only focus on the smell of the person that entered. Blood.
I couldn't control my body anymore, I was captivated by the smell, how strong it was and how thirsty I felt. It was like it was calling for me with seduction in its voice. I wanted it so badly.
So I attacked.
"Rose! Come to your senses!" I heard a faint voice at the depth of my mind. It was Dr.Ali.
I tried to stop my body from moving forward, tried to control that monstrous beast inside of me. But it just doesn't want to be tamed at the moment.
It felt hard to breath with the smell around. My hearting is almost going to burst from my chest. Excited. Wanting to just have all the blood rush and pump through it.
I was growling, shouting for it to stop moving forward. But it was simply pulling me towards the darkest depth of my mind, where I won't be able to control it anymore. The pain was crushing my insides and it was pleading me to just give in.
Until I felt my teeth dip into something.
It was enchanting, very desirable. I kept letting it go through me, refresh me just like how water refreshes a thirsty human after his long day of work. I couldn't stop wanting more of that liquid. It didn't feel like that in the first time. But right now, I feel like I am flying away with delight.
And then all the supply stopped and it became dark. Really dark. And I knew that just before I shut my eyes.
That this lust for crimson....
Is controlling my life.
