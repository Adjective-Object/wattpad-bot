So today i decide to write about Justin Bieber...
I am a Fan of this guy call Justin hes a pretty nice guy. I remember when I first started liking Justin music it was back when I was in primary school in grade 6 I had a friend who loved him and so I gave him a try and I loved his music and so I just started listeing everything for him!!!. I never liked justin in a way where I wanted to be his girlfriend I don't know why but anyways justin is freaking hottt!!! But he's taken by ( 34Angilee). The hardest year for Justin fans were when he was acting up pissing in buckets going to jail etc etc I really didn't think he should have put his fans through that but at the same time we have to understand that he was under pressure and he was losing his self . He has apologize and explain it all to us which I greatly and admire and respect about Justin some other celebrities wouldn't care less about there fans and wouldn't explain they would just leave them confuse but Justin made a video for us did an interview explaining etc. Some fans have left Justin when he was acting up which I understand I mean no one wants a cocky ass idol but to those who stayed through thick and thin you guys are amazing!!!! And deserve to meet and hug the hell out of Justin because you guys earned it!!! It takes a great deal of strength and love to stay with someone through there storms you guys can proudly say you have been with justin for better or worst.~Jeneilia X
