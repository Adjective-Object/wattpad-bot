I got to my room,after a hour of Q&A with Logan,made me very tired. I opened the door and heard Ren yelling at my hellhound pup,Pip,which really got annoying."Sarah,thank god you're back,the furry ball,isn't looking so good." Ren said,which I dropped my bag and hurried over to the white puffy pup,scoping him up and running. I almost ran into Logan,which I really didn't want to do with Pip in my hands."Hey,Sarah you forgot your notebook in.." Logan didn't get to finish because I was running again.I got to the infirmary,where Dr.Knight looked at me,seeing my worried expression, looked very considerate."What's wrong Sarah?"Dr.Knight asked."My hellhound,Pip is sick," Dr. Knight raised his eyebrows," can you help him?" I asked handing Pip to him."Yes,it seems I can." Dr. Knight says."Thank you." I say as Dr. Knight takes him behind on of those white things,that look like racks with cloth over them."That's why you couldn't talk to me,and let me return your notebook." I heard Logan say from behind me.I turned abruptly to face him,"What?""Your little hellhound,which I can say isn't allowed in these walls,is sick." Logan says smiling."Yeah,well it was alone and cold,it would've died without me." I say,hoping my eyes weren't watering to bad.,because I was close to tears."I'm sorry." Logan said it as a meaningful apology.I smiled,and Dr. Knight came out with Pip all yippy and new."Thank you, Dr. Knight." I said taking Pip from him."No problem,just so you know I'll keep this between us." Dr. Knight said,and I smiled."That means you too,Logan." Dr. Knight said, turning around and heading toward his office. "You have to promise." I said looking into his eyes(more like staring.)"I promise not to tell another living soul." Logan said,smiling at me."Good." I said turning and taking Pip back to my room.
