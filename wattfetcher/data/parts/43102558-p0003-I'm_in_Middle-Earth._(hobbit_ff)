We walked on. Thorin wanted to tell his friends about the meeting. I had to make a few suggestions. We stopped at the Iron Hills. Thorin led the way to the bar. I noticed three dwarves having a drinking contest. I chuckled at how funny they looked drinking. The eldest was chugging down gallons. The second oldest was drinking quarts while the youngest was drinking pints. The eldest walked over to us with a drink in each hand.
"Would you like a drink lass?" The dwarf asked.
"Sure." I smiled and took a drink.
I drank it slowly. Thorin chuckled at his friend. I finished the drink. Music started playing. The two youngest took my hands and danced with me. I was busy laughing. They were doing the dancing and forcing me to dance. The blonde dwarf released my hand while the youngest spun me around quickly. I felt dizzy. The youngest released my hand too. I fell to the ground. I waited for the dizzy effects to go away. I stood up.
"Dwalin, Fili, Kili, let me introduce the girl you had drink and dance. Her name is Michelle. We need to talk." Thorin added.
"All right lad. Fili, Kili, give the lass a tour. I will tell you later about our discussion." Dwalin said.
Dwalin and Thorin walked away. Fili and Kili took my hands again. They led the way. They showed me everywhere but their rooms and their mom's room. They were leading me to Thorin's room. They opened the doors. I walked in the room. It was huge and beautiful. I went to his desk. There was a book with Thorin printed on the cover. I took it and hid it in my bag to read later. I continued to look around. He had his weapons on a weapon's rack. I took his bow. There was an archery range in his room.
I equipped the quiver. I latched an arrow on the bow and aimed at the bullseye. I took a deep breath then exhaled slowly releasing the arrow at the last breath. It hit the direct center. I copied what I did before but quicker. It broke the first arrow in half. I jumped in excitement. I put the bow on my back. I grabbed a few throwing knives and threw them at the three targets in the center.
I took a sword. I swung it around. It was a little heavy but I could still swing it. I continued to practice until the sword hit another. I saw Thorin holding the other sword. I quickly released the weapon then ran out to the dwarf brothers. I punched both of them in their arms. "You were supposed to be keeping watch." I growled.
"You were great with weapons. How long have you trained in using them?" Fili asked.
"Never."
"You were great though as if you have been using weapons for a while." Kili added.
"It just felt natural to me."
"Where is your bag and why do you still have the bow and quiver on still?" Kili wondered.
"Crap. I forgot. I will be back in a second."
I snuck back to Thorin's room. He was talking to someone. "She used my weapons and tried to take my journal! She took my bow and quiver! What am I supposed to think Dwalin?! She is a thief!" Thorin yelled. My heart ached a little. I put the bow and quiver down gently. I ran away ignoring Fili's and Kili's calls. I ran to the secret garden Fili and Kili showed me. Only they and myself knew about it. I climbed the huge tree and allowed the tears to flow.
Thorin's POV....
"She used my weapons and tried to take my journal! She took my bow and quiver! What am I supposed to think Dwalin?! She is a thief!" I yelled.
"She must have been curious. Maybe you should at least talk to her and get her side of the story. I don't believe she meant to take your bow and quiver. She probably wanted to read your journal thinking it was a book." Dwalin suggested.
"Uncle, it's our fault. We brought her here to show her your room. When she saw your weapons, her eyes filled with curiosity. She forgot that she still had your bow and quiver. We found them outside your door. She wanted to return them. We saw her coming back with tears in her eyes. She is not a thief. We showed her the treasure room. She didn't care for it." Fili and Kili explained.
"Where did she go?" I asked.
"The secret garden of ours. I'll show you." Kili added.
"Good."
