Chapter 20 Shea's P.O.V
My eyes flutter open and my small naked body is pressed against Seths. His warmth making my body relax.
I look at him and blush.
God I love him..
God I love us.
Hes so damn handsome..
I gently rest my small hand on his cheek and my thumb gently caresses his soft skin.
"S-Shea..?" Seth whispers softly. His voice raspy from being so tired. I instantly smile and look into his eyes.
"Well hello there sleeping beauty" I say with a chuckle. He smirks and pushes me slightly and that makes me just cuddle into him.
He pulls me close to him and kisses my forehead. I smile up at him. "I love you" I whisper to him and he softly pecks my lips.
"I love you to-"
"SHAY!!! IM HO-" Lisa walks in and stops dead in her tracks. Her mouth drops open and then turns into a huge smirk. "OH MY GOD!"
"Lisa shush!" Seth says as he sits up, I just cover myself more and blush.
"Haha you guys did the nastehhhh" She says with a smirk.
"Lisa! What the hell get out! You better be here alone!"
"God I am! Chill Seth!" Lisa says with a huff, her hands laying on her hips. I softly chuckle and look up at Seth. He looks so angry and I gently grab his hand. I watch as his expression softens and he looks over at me, looking in my eyes. He slowly leans down and softly kisses me and we stop as we hear Lisa jumping and clapping in the back ground. "THIS IS SO AMAZING I CANT! I honestly ship you guys so hard" She laughs. I honestly swear this 10 year old has the brain and heart of a 16 year old teen!
"Lisa, can you give us a moment?" I ask softly, sitting up and still covering myself.
"Sure thing" She smirks with a wink at us.
As she leaves and closes the door, Seth pulls my lips back to his softly, my face flushing with a deep blush. He slowly pulls away and smiles at me as his hand rounds my neck, his thumb caressing the hickey.
"Shes so slick" He exclaims with a chuckle.
"Oh I know" I laugh as I pull away and slowly get up. My legs wobble and then I balance myself. I walk to my closet and search for some clothes.
"This is a great view" Seth whispers in my ear. I jump not realizing he was there and I relax as I feel his arms slowly wrap around my bare waist.
"Hehe baby, you can have more later, I need to get dressed! And plus Lisa will walk in on us!" I say with a giggle as I pry his arms off of me. He chuckles with a nod and winks at me. He walks away and puts on his boxers. I just blush and admire his sexy body.
I throw on a thong and bra and I pull a tee over my head. I put on Seths sweat pants and he smiles at me. He drops what hes doing and walks over to me and wraps his arms around my waist. "You look amazing in my clothes" He whispers. I blush and softly look away. His finger lays under my chin and pulls my face towards his, looking in my eyes. He gently places his lips against mine and my eyes flutter closed at the amazing feeling.
