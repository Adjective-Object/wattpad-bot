You are a fascinating work of art
Yet you're as secretive as the dark
That sets us apart.
I don't want to be just another star,
I want to be your moon, your sun, and all of your stars.
I want to kiss every scar
That lives on your wrist.
I wanna need the taste of your lips.
Maybe it's fate or maybe it's clover that we sip.
I'm getting kind of dizzy and I feel insane
But I think that's how I play this game.
And although I'm far from okay,
You numb the pain.
I am not a very good poet
And all my readers know it.
;P
