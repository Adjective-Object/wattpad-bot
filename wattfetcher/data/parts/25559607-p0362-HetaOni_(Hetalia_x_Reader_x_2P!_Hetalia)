Japan nodded. "Hai... You're right. It even seemed like...they've been with her longer than we have. But it's still confusing, though. At first, I thought they were just using her to hold something against us...but now, I'm starting to think that that's not the case anymore..."


"It's possible. That's why I think that she's safe for now. But, of course, we're going to bring her back to us to be sure." Italy said.


Turning back to his cooking, Japan smiled. "Right. Well then, looks like I'll prepare more food in case we finally get (Name)-chan back."


"That's the spirit, Japan~" Italy grinned.



Italy walked up to England who was standing by the magic circleâ€”which was still emanating a warm glow of light.


Italy slowly approached him and tapped the Brit's shoulder. "Um... listen are you feeling all right?"


"Huh? What the hell, since when do you worry about my well-being? There's nothing wrong with me, though" England replied with a puzzled expression.



"I see..." Italy nodded, rubbing his elbow.


England's gaze suddenly fell upon the American who was standing a few feet from them. "Anyway, can't you do something about America? He ignores me when I talk to him. What happened?"


"Well, I'll try talking to him." Italy said, glancing over at America. Turning back to England, he spoke, "And you, England, try not to use too much magic. Especially if it has a certain range or has anything to do with turning back time-"


"Huh, where did that come from? Well, I don't know what you're talking about but I'll keep that in mind." England told him.


Italy gave a faint smile and nodded. "Okay."


America was standing by the beds in the bottom right corner of the room. Italy walked over to him and spoke, "America, it's time to go."


"Hm? Oh, yeah! You can count on me! I'm all ready, so we can go any time!" America said, a smile forced on his face.
