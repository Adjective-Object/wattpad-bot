---CHAPTER IX: Phone Calls (Part 2)---
//Third Person PoV//
An Italian man wearing a blue military uniform searched around the remains of the burnt rope ladder in the tunnel within the basement.
"No...
It isn't here, after all. Where did I hide it,again...? Was it on the 3rd floor, maybe?
Maybe not. Ugh, I'm really anxious now. But if I calm down, I'll remember...
There was another one that I hid with America. And then... um..."
Suddenly, he heard someone shout, "I found you, Venezianooo!!!"
"... What?"
Italy looks up to see Romano and Spain, above him at the supposed-to-be exit.
"Ro--Wh-why?!" Italy asked, shocked that his brother and his friend are there.
"Good thing the front door wasn't opening, so I was just loitering around here. I finally found you! What the hell have you been up to?" the older brother asked.
Spain looked below and gave a sigh of relief. "Ita! Thank God! You can't stay there all alone. Where are the other guys?"
"What--what are you doing here?! We didn't ask you to come here!" Italy told them, exasperated.
"What did you do with the clocks? Did you break all of them?!" Romano asked.
"---!!
How--how did you know about that?" Italy answered his question with another question, obviously confused as to why Romano knew.
"Answer me! Did you break the last clock?!"
Italy was taken aback. "It can't be... You weren't supposed to know about that... What are you even doing here in the first place?"
"Romano, I know you're happy to see him, but don't get too excited..." Spain tried to hold back the younger man.
"Veneziano! I'm coming there right now, so don't move!!" Romano said.
Italy waved his arms, motioning them to leave, a frustrated expression on his face. "N-no!! Don't come here, no matter what!! Go home!! What are you doing here?! How--how did you know?!"
Romano was silent for a while, but then spoke softly, "......Try saying my name."
Italy furrowed his brows, but answered, "R-Romano..."
"No! Say my full name!!" the Southern Italian ordered him.
"......Italy.
Italy Roma...no...", he replied slowly.
Romano gave a warm smile. "Yeah, that's right. I'm Italy, too!
I don't know everything you remember, but I do plan on carrying at least a little of that burden on my shoulders!
You haven't been alone all this time! You've...broken quite a few clocks, haven't you?"
"Y-yes... but..."
"The flow of time got fixed. That's why we were finally able to get here. Not just us, you know? The others are also coming to help you guys." Spain added.
Romano took a deep breath. "I fiiiiiinally found you. I've been trying to find you for ages--couldn't find you--the phone wouldn't work, and sometimes I felt these shocks, like half of me had disappeared, every single time--You--IDIOT!!!", he shouted.
"(I wasn't able to bear it... That's why several of my memories flowed to Romano and hecame looking for us...)
