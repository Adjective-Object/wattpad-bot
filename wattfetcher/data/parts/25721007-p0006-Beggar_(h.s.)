The rest of the day was pretty fun. Louis took me shopping for more clothes. Liam and I played Mario Kart, which I won. We argued how he wanted a rematch and how I supposably cheated. And then we all watched a few movies. I ate two full bags of popcorn while the rest of the boys shared a bowl. Harry didn't join us though. He went to some kind of college frat party or something.
"What movie should we watch next?" Liam asked the four of us.
"Actually, I'm kind of tired," I yawned. It's been a long day.
"Yeah me too," Louis agreed. And everyone else nodded.
We all wished each other good night and went to bed. Niall told me to sleep in Harry's room that he never uses. I refused at first, but he said to me that he probably won't be back tonight. So I gave in and drifted off to sleep.

I woke up to someone fiddling with the door handle of the bedroom. I checked the time, 2am. Who could possibly be trying to get in this early in the morning?
The door finally opened and there stood Harry's silhouette. Shouldn't he be partying? He didn't even manage to turn on the light.
Harry threw off his shirt and pants leaving him in his boxers. I guess he doesn't know I'm in here.
"Harry?" I called his name.
"Shh.." He chuckled and hopped into bed with me.
"You'll regret this in the morning," I warned him. He's drunk anyway so it wouldn't matter how hard I tried.
"I don't care. Good night," he smiled and closed his eyes. It was nice to have a pleasant Harry lying next to me.
Sadly, it won't last for long..
Okay so no cliffhanger. Lol. I tried to make it longer. (: By the way, Lennon is played by Liana Liberato.
