A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boatOn the oceanSending big wavesInto motionLike how a single wordCan make a heart openI might only have one matchBut I can make an explosion
This is my fight song (Hey!)Take back my life song (Hey!)Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)My power's turned onStarting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)I'll play my fight songAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Now I've still got a lot of fight left in me
~End Of Song~
The boys had walked in without us noticing. They were clapping and cheering. Colton gave me a big smile. This was gonna be the best band ever.
