Unknown POV
I look down at the paper in my hands. I wonder if she will ever find out who I am, if she does will she love me back? I shook my head as I put the letter in the envelope.
Pocketing the letter I grabbed my keys off the kitchen counter as I walked out of my apartment and get into my car, I drove to mail the letter. Once I gave the letter to the mail office I smiled as I remember Wattpad, I got put my phone as it buzzed.
Robin4Life: Hey.
I replied with,Black_Raven192: What's up?
"I love you. I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours."
