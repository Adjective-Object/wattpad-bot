Mallory:Get up, get ready, sneak out the window to school. That's my routine to avoid Corey.
I woke up to the sunshine in my eyes. I got up and stretched before making my bed. I then chose a white sweater and black skinny jeans to cover my cuts. Yes, this 14 year old girl cuts.
I stripped of my clothing and turned on the shower. Washing my body, I got a text. After I stepped out, I checked my phone.
From ðŸ˜”ðŸ”«: slut...hurry up...don't make me go up there!
I put my phone down and put on my outfit. I put on mascara and lipgloss, grabbed my bag, and walked downstairs. I grabbed a banana and ate it walking to school...with Corey.
After a couple blocks, I saw the rest of the boys. I kept my head down as they all ran up to Corey. They bro hugged and looked at me walking away. "Hey Mallory! Where do you think you're going?" Wil shouted. I could picture their smirks in my head.
I ran and heard, "You're not getting away, Mallory!" My hair was pulled back and I saw River. He pushed me to the ground and kicked my side...hard.
He then picked me up and punched me in the stomach. I cried in pain but then River slapped me. "Shut up whore!" He shouted and dropped me back onto the ground.
As they walked off, I slowly got up and limped to school. Only 1 block away. I reached it and opened my locker to get my stuff for math. Great, River and Wil are in that class. Well, actually they're in the same exact classes as me.
This is gonna be fun.
