So, I did as Chase asked and slowly made my way to Chase's motorhome. Chase's mom caught up to me real quick, "Sweetie, I really like you and hope my son can see how unique and special you are. But please be careful.""Don't worry - I have no intentions of breaking his heart." I smiled at her. "I meant," she paused for a second, "Be careful." "Oh?" I was super confused, "Oh," I said...I think she means..."Oh! Ohhh" I said as his mom just shook her head in a 'yes' movement - seeing that u finally get what she meant. And now I couldn't be blushing harder. "Um, Mrs. Elliott -""No need to say anything. I'm not stupid Hun, you're very pretty, my son obviously likes you a lot and you two are teenagers. What else would teenagers, left alone in their own little home do?" I watched her cock an eyebrow through her sunglasses. Thank goodness my sunglasses were super dark because my eyes were wide was embarrassment. "I'd love to be a grandmother to Chase's children one day, but not yet." She then patted my shoulder, smiled and walked away.
