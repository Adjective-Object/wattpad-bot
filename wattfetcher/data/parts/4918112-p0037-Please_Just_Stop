My BBFL and I are going to a One Direction concert! OMG OMG OMGGGGGGGG!!!!!
Oh wow... they look so hot on stage...
AAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! I've been kidnapped/raped by One Direction!! This may be illegal, but it's okay because they're One Direction!
*Kill me. Kill me NOW.*
Way #2
Oh hi there! Guess what? I'm a One Direction sex slave!!
*No. No, no no no no no no no nonononononoooooooooooooooo*
And finally, Vampire stories.
What irks me to no god damn end is that Pre-Twilight sparkle bullshit, Vampires were mean and terrifying and couldn't procreate because their junk was rotten and they would kill you WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.
Now, however, Post-Twilight sparkle bullshit, Vampires MUST be hot. Vampires MUST be able to procreate. Vampires MUST be SPARKLING FAIRIES WHICH ARE TOTAL PANSIES AND MAKE SHITTY VAMPIRE/HUMAN/WEREWOLF/FAIRY OFFSPRING!!!!
This is what the plot always looks like, stolen directly from the pages of Stephanie Meyer:
Hi. I'm the depressing little vampire prick. I'm sad all the time and wear black and I'm SOOOOO RIPPED *Rips off shirt*
Oh my god.. that is one hot human mortal, who is misunderstood like me. I must spare her life and carry her off into the sunset.
Oh crap. I got her pregnant, which shouldn't be possible cause my body is rotten and I stopped making sperm a century ago, but oh well.
And now I MUST TURN HER INTO A VAMPIRE TO SAVE OUR ILLEGITIMATE CHILD AND RAISE IT TO BE A FREAK LIKE US!!!
Please, Wattpad. Grow some imagination, and some balls, and make a story that's not like any of the above.
Thank you.
