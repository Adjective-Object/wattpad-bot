It's truly alarming When the youth is dying The elderly are trying All hope is fading anyway
While schools are crowded The dreams are all drowningAny potential floating away
There's kids that are trying While others are flying Getting high Going miles astray
There is the answerDrugs will romance herMaybe then she will be obligated To stay.
