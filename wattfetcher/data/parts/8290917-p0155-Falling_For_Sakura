A few moments later when he was sure she was gone, he got out of the pool and headed back out. Before he reached the door, the room flooded with bright lights. He turned to see Darcy at the door. He walked to his brother, wondering if he was here practicing his diving at this bloody hour. But then again, it was Darcy. He could very well practice his diving at three in the morning if he wanted to.
Darcy didn't miss the bite marks on Sebastian's chest. "Looks like you had an accident."
Sebastian stiffened. "Yeah. Dog bite."
"Must be a very angry dog," Darcy commented.
Sebastian didn't say anything and headed out. Alone, Darcy sighed, his heart hammering in his chest uncomfortably. He knew, oh yes, he knew Sebastian had fallen in love with Sakura too. He knew that she too felt something toward him. But the realization only pained him even more. How could he let Sakura go when he had loved her all his life?
Shit! His head hurt. His heart ached. His whole body trembled with confusion.
"Snow what am I going to do? He's my brother," he whispered softly.
