Mia's POV
we arrived to the mall , zoe kissed ethan , when the kiss started to heat i  cleared my throat so they would STOP but they didn't so i grabed her arm and dragged her out of the car.
"why can't you stand seeing me happy" she said dramatically , i laughed
we got two dresses one black and the other is red , mine is the red one.
i was about to call ethan to pick us up, "what are you doing?"
"calling ethan , we're finished"
"no we are not" zoe pointed to victoria's secret
"what?! no , what the hell zoe it's just a party not my wedding"
"oh c'mon , maybe you'll get lucky and meet a nice guy"
"even if i meet a nice guy it's not like i'm sleeping with him"
"so you're not coming?!" zoe asked
"what you wanna buy something?!"
"yes, for ethan , it's just to change the mood like recently he's not that wild and i want to-"
"okay , too much info , too much" i interrupt her. i really do not want to know about her sex like , thank you
we entered and she headed to lingerie duh , she bought some things then we called ethan to drive us.
