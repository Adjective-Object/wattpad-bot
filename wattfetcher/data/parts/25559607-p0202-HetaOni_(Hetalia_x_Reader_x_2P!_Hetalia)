Prussia faced me and nodded. "Ja....we deeply apologise...for saying those things we said earlier. If we only knew that they had your....well....they told you...er.....If we only knew they were doing something to hold you against your will.....we could have acted differently..."



"...Yeah...that's right... It's all 'If onlys' and 'I could haves'....but it's already over. Let's not dwell on those. Besides, I understand how it feels to have been deceived, too. So I have to be sorry as well." I told them.

"A-Ack...America...let go hahaha." I chuckled a bit.

"Let us head back to the saferoom, shall we? We all have to take a good night's rest. A day of long explanations are ahead of us, after all." Japan said, looking at me.
