I don't think outsider realizes just how much it takes.
How much you have to hate yourself.
How much you have to feel unloved.
How much you have to feel unwanted.
How worthless you have to feel.
How much pain you have to be in.
To starve.
To shove fingers down your throat.
To never let your eyes rest.
To hold a flame to your flesh.
To drag a blade across your skin.
