I: Dan hasn't left his room all day.
A: He never really leaves his room, well, since we bought him his laptop and that camera.
I: He's 13 now.
A: Yeah. I want to talk to him, but i'm scared at Â what I might walk in on.
I: You think you're just going to walk in on him jacking off, don't you?
A: Yeeeaaah...
I: Well, there's a thing called 'knocking' that is really useful in these situations.
A: I know...
I: Well, then go knock on the door, wait till he says you can come in, then ask him about his day. Also, if you find anything extremely disturbing or odd, pretend you don't see it and tell me all about it!
A: Okay. <3
I: Just... Just make sure that if he is skyping with someone to say 'Sorry. You seem busy. I'll ask later.'
A: I will <3
