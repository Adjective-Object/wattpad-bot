I saw my target come int my view and sped up my pace, when I reached the car I pulled back the bat and let it swing. I kept swinging and swinging until someone grabbed me by the waist and pulled me away.
Before I could do anymore damage someone else took away the baseball bat, I struggled against the holder until they started whispering to me.
"Shhhh calm down, it's okay. We just need you to relax and calm down." The voice sounded like silk and I instantly relaxed at a speed that i'm pretty sure isn't humanly possible, before I knew what was happening I was being turned around and being pulled into a chest in a hug.
The hug was so warm and full of love and compassion, a type of hug that I haven't ha since my parents died. I was sure it was Liz until I heard some shocking words "Hey Amanda thanks for pulling Sam away from that car."
