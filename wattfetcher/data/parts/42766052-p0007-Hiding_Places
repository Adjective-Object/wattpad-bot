My hand was millimeters from pressing the doorbell.
Your doorbell.
My hand was frozen though
If I pressed it would I fall into your spell again?
If I pressed it would I fall for you again?
If I pressed it was I a coward if I didn't say a word?
I pondered it all.
The outcomes.
The world hates me though.
So the door slid open.
You filled the doorway with your frame.
Your black hair shorter.
Your blue eyes bright.
Your cheeks more defined.
I wanted to reach out and touch you.
I wanted to pull you to me and hug you.
I wanted to inhale the scent of your hair.
"What do you need?"
That was what you said to me?
"I don't know."
I didn't.
"I could see you through the security cameras standing here."
I am such a creep.
"OK."
What else was I to say?
"You come crawling back each time.Every damned time."
"I know."
"Do you think I will take you back?"
"No."
"Then why come back after I broke your heart?"
"I don't know."
"I never loved you you know it was an act."
"I know."
I sulked away.
I was attracted to her in a simple way.
She was an electro magnet.
I was small bits of metal.
She drew me to her.
Every small piece.
For a while I'm kind of whole.
Then they take away the electricity source.
Stripping it of its magnetic abilities.
Making me broken once again.
Fuck I'm whipped.
I am so stupid.
Im not broken.
I'm shattered.
