(Luna Knight and Tadashi Hamada)When she turned around, she blushed darker. Tadashi sat next to her. "Hey. No need to be embarrassed. It was only one thing and... wow... I don't know what to say but. Merry Christmas." Tadashi said softly. "Merry Christmas." Luna said. Then Tadashi planted his lips to hers on another kiss. It was the best present that they had on Christmas Eve.
Hiro and Rosa enjoyed the little party and they exchanged their gifts. Rosa received a silver heart locket that says: "H.H. + R.R." (Hiro Hamada + Rosa Ramos)Rosa loved her gift and she gave Hiro a gift. Hiro opened it and it was a photo frame of Tadashi, him, Rosa, and Luna when it was their first day at school. But Rosa, Harry, Luna, Ron, and Hermione were only third year students and Tadashi and Hiro was only first year students. Hiro loved the gift too and gave a kiss on Rosa's cheek. Everyone had an enjoyable time the next morning. Best Christmas ever., Hiro and Tadashi thought.
