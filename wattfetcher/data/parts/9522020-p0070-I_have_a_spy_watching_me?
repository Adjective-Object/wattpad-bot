"Stay right in the hall."  I told her.
She nodded and did as I said.  I turned back to Greg.  He had gotten the book and put it back.  Then he asked me, "What's with that weird question of Jaycie being Paul's girlfriend?"
"Paul didn't tell you?"  I asked with a raise of an eyebrow.
"Nah.  Paul likes to surprise me out of no where.  He said he'd explain, but he never did."  He said.
"Well then I guess I should tell you Tessa found her mate."
He looked up surprised.
"Wait, they're mates?  Woah. Good for them."  He replied with a smile.  "I'm glade my Beta found his mate."
"Have you met your mate?"  I asked him.
"No, I haven't.  My sister has met hers though."  He replied with a slight groan at the end.  "My own sister who is 16 met hers.  Watch Morse find his mate before I do."
He rolled his eyes and I chuckled.
"Hey, you don't know.  Mates come when you least expect them to."  I said with a shrug.  "You'll meet your mate soon Greg.  Come on my land and we'll look all over for your mate."  I said.
"Really?  You'd do that with me?"  He asked hopeful and surprised.
I gave him a grin.
"Of course.  Chelsea and I would help you with that.  Just get Paul to help Lakyn find his here."  I replied.
"You got a deal.  How about we take Lakyn around at the mall all day tomorrow."  He asked.
"You know he said that he smelt her scent at the school at Jaycie's table."  I replied.
"Really?  What stopped him?"  He asked.
"He wasn't paying attention and he thought it was nothing.  Until later when he felt down in the dumps.  He was asking his wolf about it and was shocked he found his mate.  He just doesn't know which one of them is his mate.
"Well, I hope it isn't Jaycie, Thalia, or Tania."  He replied.
"I understand Jaycie, but why not Thalia and Tania?"  I asked.
"Tania is dating Skull and Tania will threaten the shit out of Lakyn if it is Thalia.  Thalia and Tania are sisters and stick together no matter what."  Greg says.  "No one wants to face Tania at all.  She knows how to throw a right and left hook."
I nod slowly.
"Hey be open to the option that he may be gay.  He might be mates with your brother, Justin..."
"Don't continue.  I'll be open to it, but don't continue."  I just nod again.
"I think Justin and Lakyn would of known last year though so it isn't them.  Who else sat at her table?"  I asked him.
"No one else just my brother, sister, Eric, Skull, Chase, Thalia, Tania, Jaycie, Justin, and that's it."
"So we better be prepared if it is the person who I think it is.  Lakyn is in a world of pain."  I said and Greg burst out laughing.
"Well, let's go check on the others."  He said and we did.

He chuckled at me.
