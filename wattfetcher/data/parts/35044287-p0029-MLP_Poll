Now I will say that out of all the songs that are left this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it's a good song. But it's one of the songs that get annoying real quick. But anyway if you voted it out you get to vote again! So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
TRUE TRUE FRIEND
WHAT MY CUTIE MARK IS TELLING ME
LET THE RAINBOW REMIND YOU
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
SHINE LIKE RAINBOWS
Good luck to the nominees!
