"Where did you get the money from" He knocked the door.
"I told you I'm not broke"
"So why are you living with us if you are not broke and apparently can afford a flat" He asked.
"Good question, my parents said that it will be safer if I live with a family ... they said"
Only if they knew ...
"Thanks for the food sis" He left.
He has a good side.
*2 weeks later*
"I'm going, okay ?" I went to school before Elina because I needed to ask the English teacher some questions. Like I said : I'm not that good in English. I can speak and write it well, but I'm not as good as the other students because their original language is English.
*At school*
I headed to Mr.Roberts' classroom.
"Good morning Mr.Roberts, may I come in ?" I asked politely.
"Good morning Ms.???"
"Just call me Leena"
"Come in Leena"
"I came here to ask you about yesterday's lesson, the shakespeare thing"
"Oh yeah sure"
"Mr.Roberts ?" I saw the one person I hated to see, can't I take a rest ?
"Hello Jake"
"Hey Leena" He extended his hand.
"I Don't shake" I ignored looking at him.
"May I know the reason behind your visit ?" Mr.Roberts asked.
"Just came to say hi" I felt the smirk in his tone, don't ask me how but I really felt it.
"See you in class, Leena" He put his stupid big head in front of me and winked at me.
"Oh please, I really hope not" I gave him a fake smile then he got out.
"Pink looks great on you by the way" He came back, said that sentence, then ran away fast.
"If any other girl was in your place, She'd faint. Believe me, every girl in the school admires him, even the female teachers" Mr.Roberts chuckled.
"You can say ... I'm different. Now back to the Shakespeare thing"
Mr.Roberts answered all my questions.
"You're really good for a foreign girl whose main language isn't English" Mr.Roberts said.
"Thank you. Now I have to go before the classes begin"
"Yeah it's Okay, I'm here if you need anything" He smiled and extended his hand.
"Sorry Mr.Rogers but like I said, I don't shake"
"Why" He asked.
"In my religion we are not allowed to do any physical contact with men other than father, father's brothers, mother's brothers, grandpa, grand dad, Look for it in the Internet, now excuse me I'm sorry but I need to go" I walked out.
"Bye" He said.
I walked to my locker to get the book of the subject I hate the most in school
Chemistry = A taste of hell
I entered my class.
"Leena, late as usual, detention as usual" The teacher said. Â I think she hates me.
