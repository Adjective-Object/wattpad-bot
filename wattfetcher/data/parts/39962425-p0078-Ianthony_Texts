A: Ian, do you remember the day we met?
I: of course i do, you idiot! just because it was around 30 years ago, doesn't mean i don't remember it! (did i do the maths right? probably not!)
A: ah, that day was amazing.
I: it was.
A: it was a normal day and we were in our science class.
I: our teacher paired us up for a random project that we ended up flunking because we were too busy hanging out to care about it.
A: our teacher got so pissed that we didn't have anything done!
I: His face was so red that he looked like a tomato!
A: it was one of the most amazingly hilarious things i have seen ever!
I: yeah... but it still doesn't beat Joshua crying at our wedding!
A: nothing will every beat that, Ian.
I: Anthony, do you remember the time i confessed my love for you?
A: how can i forget? it was the day after we shot our video Pokemon In Real Life 4. you were almost in tears. i asked you what was wrong then you confessed to me. at the time, i had never been so happy when you told me about your feelings because i felt the same.
I: what's the happiest you have been now?
A: our wedding day, obviously <3
I: mine too <3
A: oh, remember when we came out to our fans?
I: yeah. they were a fuckload more supportive than i thought they would be.
A: it was very rare to see a homophobic comment, especially since gay marriage is now legal everywhere. being gay, bi, trans, demi, polyromantic, and any other sexuality is now normal. yes, there are some ignorant people, but there always will be at least one person that is a dick.
I: well said, Ant.
I: while we are going down memory lane, do you remember when i proposed?
A: how could i forget? you texted me and proposed in the cutest way possible!
I: <3
A: <3
I: i enjoy our memories.
A: i enjoy them too <3
