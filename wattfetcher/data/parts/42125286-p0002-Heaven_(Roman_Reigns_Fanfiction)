"Do you think he'd react differently if you saw him today?" She questions.
"To be honest? I don't want to see him at all. I know I have to tonight, and it make some want to vomit." I tell her.
She frowns at me, then rubs my arm.
"You'll do great tonight. You're a rockstar." She smiles. "He's not going to know what hit him. I've got to go get ready. I'll see you out in the ring."
*In ring segment*
I stood beside Nikki as Hunter spoke about The Shield.
" The three of you want to run around like you own this place. You want to run around like you can get anything you and quite frankly, I'm sick of it. You three have been a thorn in my side for months and if no one wants to deal with the three of you, I will. Get your asses out here, now!" He hollers in the mic.
Nikki winked at me.
"Sierra, Hotel, India, Echo, Lisa, Delta. Shield."
My heart dropped as the three of them made their way down to the ring slowly. Roman didn't seem to recognize me at first which was good, I suppose.
"You wanted us? Here we are." Dean grins.
"You know exactly what I want, Ambrose. Get your asses in here. Now." Hunter replies.
They climb into the ring, looking at Hunter.
Roman was handed the mic and I sweat to you, time could not be passing any slower.
"Hunter, Nikki.." His jaw dropped when he saw me. "Kamryn."
The smirk on his face was enough to make me run across this ring to punch him in the face.
"Long time, no see, baby girl." He winks.
BOOM. Welcome to Heaven! Come along for the ride!
