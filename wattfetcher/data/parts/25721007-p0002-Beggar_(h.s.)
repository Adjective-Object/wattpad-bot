It wasn't always this way. I didn't always have to scavenge for the least bit of food or hold out a smelly, old beanie for money. It's been like this for years.
I used to have a family. A mom, a dad, a brother, and two sisters.
I was the youngest of the family. My mother died from cancer when I was ten years old. We couldn't stop mourning her for years. My father took it the hardest. He became a drunk, he would go out every night while my oldest sister watched us other three.
One night, we were all in the car driving home from Rose's softball practice. Father was contaminated with alcohol, again. He was yelling at Fawn for calling him a 'drunk' and an 'asshole of a father'. Before anyone knew it, he ran a red light and a speeding vehicle impacted the side. I was the only survivor.
I was in shock for months. No one could get a single word out of my mouth. There was a constant replay of the crash in my mind which I couldn't get out.
The hospital put me in a small home for kids with no family. They made us do chores 24/7. We barely had time to eat or make friends. I felt like Annie.
I got tired of doing the same thing for years. So, I ran away when I was 19, soon after I graduated. No one tried to even find me.
I applied for a few jobs and the only one that hired me was McDonalds. Not my dream job, but at least I had some money. Yet, not enough for an apartment. So, I stayed at a few hotels.
A few weeks later, I lost my job because of arguing with a rude customer. Since then, for three years, I've been living on the streets of New York City, jobless.

"Wake up sweetie, it's pay time," I heard a faint voice say. My eyes were shut and my cheek laid on the hard ground. A few moments later, I opened my tired eyes and sat up.
"I told you, Brock. I am not doing your shitty work," I spat at the familiar face.
"You know what I'm capable of, Lennon. So why do you continue to oppose my offers? I'm trying to help you," Brock growled.
"I don't need your help and I rather not go to prison for selling your drugs. Just get the hell away from me," I stood up to be level with him.
He pinned me against the building I was sleeping next to. I winced as he held my wrists above my head. No one seemed to care or pay attention to what was going on.
"Let go of me right now or I will-"
He laughed, interrupting my statement, "You'll what? Tell your family that you don't have?"
Tears formed at the brim of my eyes. I shouted, "Don't you ever say that again!"
"Poor homeless Lennon," he mocked me. I squirmed under his hold and tried to push him.
"Just please let go," I screamed and he gripped my wrist tighter, "You're hurting me!"
"Get off her," A rough, accented man said behind us.
"Why should I listen to you? I don't even know you," Brock spat.
Before I knew it, my wrists were released from his hold and I was free. He was on the ground. I looked for my savior, but he ran off. All I remember was a curly haired, green eyed man with a massive amount of tattoos on his arms.
I wish I could've said thanks..
Hey guys!! So, first of all, I didn't make a long chapter because it's the first one and I just wanted to give some background information on Lennon. Second, if you can, check out my other Harry fanfic called Innocence. I have almost 1k reads. Third, let me know what you think about this first chapter and please vote!
