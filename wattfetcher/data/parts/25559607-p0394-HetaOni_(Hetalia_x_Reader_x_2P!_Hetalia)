"Those—Those are the clocks that I was looking for! What's Luciano going to do with those?" I thought to myself, furrowing my brows.


Noticing my questioning gaze, he faced me and spoke, "Oh, don't mind these. We just need it...for our meeting."


Some voice in the back of my mind made me feel like crossing my arms and telling him outright that what he just said was very suspicious. I'm not sure why, but it just fits into the category of shady things to say.


Though when he faced me, I saw something different in his magenta-coloured orbs. I'm not sure what it is. Is it sadness? Frustration?


Loneliness?


Unconsciously, I found myself walking up to him and placing a hand on his cheek. "Are you...okay?" I asked.


He suddenly took a step back and looked at me with wide eyes. "Wh-What? What's up with you?" he asked, looking away again.


"Just answer my question." I told him sternly, not letting him change the subject. "Because you looked like you're really...troubled or something, so I wanted to make sure."



Luciano faced me with a frown. "Why would you want to know?"


"Obviously, because I'm concerned." I said, placing a hand on my hip. Seeing his expression change slightly, I decided it was best to say it straight out. "I care, of course."


His mageta-coloured eyes grew wide for a moment. He adjusted his hold on the box so that it's just his left arm holding it to his side.


"I'm okay." he told me softly. He suddenly raised a hand above me and pat my head gently. "...Grazie, (Second Name)."


Now, it was my turn to take a step back, feeling flustered all of a sudden. "I-If you say so. You're welcome..." Looking towards the door, I spoke, "You, uhm, better get back to your meeting room. The others are waiting."


"Si. They are." he said in a low voice. Quietly, he walk towards the door and went out into the hall. I closed the door behind him when he left.



What...
