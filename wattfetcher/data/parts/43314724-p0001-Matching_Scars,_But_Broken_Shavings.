I slipped on my cardigan and went downstairs. Breakfast was already fixed at the table next to the piled boxes around the house. Yeah, we moved. Me and my family lived in Nevada, but sense mom and dad were in hard shape, we moved to Colorado. Just in the meantime. Meantime of a lifetime. Which meant we'll be here a long long while.
"Gabby, why are you always wearing that cardigan? You need to take it off once and a while and feel the breeze of fresh air." Mom said opening boxes. It had only been two weeks and we were already almost finished unpacking. "Mom, it's my favorite one that grandma made me." This peach creamed cardigan matched a lot of my clothes. It did have little holes in it, but I didn't care. I needed something over my arms. "Okay, well we settled things about school already and tomorrow, (Monday), is gonna be the big day. Your first day of a new school. I expect some friends and some good stories going on." Mom reminded.
As you can tell, mom on the other hand is, um...how should I put this, protective, snoopy, wanting to know women. Of course she means the world to me but, honestly. I have a life. And so many stories to tell. The only problem I have is if she would just let me tell them. Now a days she is always on her phone chit chatting and trying to talk into some job interviews and things like that such. And then comes dad. The always angry worker like mom.
"The job I had ready to interview was cut. They took another employer instead." He said in a madly mood. "Huh..." Mom signed as she shook her head. "I'm still looking. But, if I figure something out I'll let you know." She said. Mom wants to be a teacher at Brooklyn Stone College then dad wants to be an engineer. We've got a busy life ahead. And of course I'm 16. An 11th grader. Just hoping that when I go to college, I don't get my mom as a teacher. If she gets the job. If you know her, she embarrasses you in front of everyone. And it's scary.
Anyway, about my cardigan. Yeah, I have to have something over my arms. Why? My scars. They'll show. So I cover them.
