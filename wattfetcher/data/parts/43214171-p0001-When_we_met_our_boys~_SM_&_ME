I picked out my black booty shorts, an oversized red magcon sweatshirt with flip flops and a mascara and eye liner, foundation, blush, and some cherry lip gloss. After I got all that I hopped in the shower. After my shower I got all that on and put my hair in a simply messy bun.Haley asked me to pick out her outfit while she showered. I got her booty shorts with a "Shawn mendes" crop top, flip flops and mascara, foundation, eye liner, blush, and some chap stick.
