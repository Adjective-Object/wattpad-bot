You say that you'll be back, and that you and I can prosper,
Even though I've been upset over you leaving.
And I trust you.
I trust that I shouldn't be upset, that it's going to be okay
Even though it's hardly ever okay.
But I trust you.
And I dwell on the promise that
I'll be your unexplored galaxy, you'll bring water to my desert.
I trust you.
- (m.m)
For you, my angel in disguise,
And the sweetest person alive. x
