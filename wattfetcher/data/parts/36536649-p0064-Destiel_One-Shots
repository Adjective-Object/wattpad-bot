Castiel had literally just gotten off the phone with his mom and collapsed onto the bed when it happened.
It began with the ringtone, blasting out of his phone.
YOU ARE THE BEST THING, THAT'S EVER BEEN MIIIIIIINE
Castiel immediately picked up. "Dean!"
"Heya Cas." For once, Dean's voice sounded clear over the phone. Dean and Cas had gotten into different colleges; Cas getting into the local one, Dean getting into the University of Louisiana.
"Dean," Cas repeated. "Dean. How are you, sweetie?"
"Everything's... great, I guess."
"Dean?" Cas asked. "Everything okay?"
"It's just..." Dean began. "I miss you. I miss you so much. I miss your eyes and your ears. I miss your nose and your smile. I miss your laugh. Your laugh, Cas, it makes my day. Especially when your eyes crinkle up at the corners, because, damn, you're adorable. I miss seeing you every single day, and I miss kissing you every single day, and god knows I miss your hip bones. Cas, I love you. And I just, I miss you. So much."
Cas flopped over onto his stomach on his bed and buried his face in his pillow. "Dean. I love you. I love you. I love you."
"Uh, Cas? I didn't quite hear that."
Cas flopped onto his back. He yelled into the phone. "DEAN. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. Got that?"
"Not quite." Cas could practically hear his smile. "Could you say that again?"
"Not til you say it back."
"I LOVE YOU, CAS."
"I LOVE YOU, DEAN... I just wish I could see you."
"Mmm. I know, honeybee." At that same time, Cas' doorbell rang.
"Hold on, Dean, some dick is ringing the bell." Dean snickered.
Cas (reluctantly) got out of bed and trudged down the stairs. When he got to the door, he began to say, "I THOUGHT ALREADY FUCKING I TOLD YOU, BECKY, WE DON'T WANT ANY-"
He stopped talking for a second because Becky was not at the door.
It was Dean.
"Girl Scout Cookies," he finished.
"Heya Cas."
"... DEAN!" he screamed happily.
"CAS!" Dean yelled in the same tone.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and his legs around Dean's waist. He showered him with kisses.
"Missed. You. So. Much!" Cas yelled in between kisses.
"Easy there, tiger," Dean told him, to no avail.
"How'd you get here?!" Cas asked.
"You're not gonna believe this. One of my professors, Dr. Harvelle - you met her, you know when I took you there - she said that I literally looked like my heart had stopped beating. So she pulled some strings, got me out of classes for the rest of the week, and, well, here I am."
Cas hit him playfully. "Why didn't you tell me?" he asked.
"Wanted to surprise you."
"Dean, " Cas said, "I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU."
Dean sniffed in. "Sorry, bro," he said, in a dudebro voice, "no homo, you know?"
"More like 'no hetero,' you dick. I knew a dick was ringing the bell."
"I LOVE YOU TOO, CAS."
