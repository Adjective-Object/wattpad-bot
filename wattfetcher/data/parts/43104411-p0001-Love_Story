Hi I'm Jade and I just moved here from NYC and it is a big change from a big city to a small town now I live in Atlanta,Georgia.*first day of a new school*I wake up to my room light and my mom saying "honey get up it's your first day of a new school." So I jumped out of bed and glazed in my closet I wanted to make an impression so I picked out a red and blue shirt the read "areo" on it and some skinny jeans and a hoodie that had my favorite band on it and walked down stairs and grabbed two pieces of saugue and ran out the door. I was walking to the bus stop and two boys came running up to me the older one said "hi my name is dillion and this is my little brother draven" I said "hi I'm Jade I moved in a couple of days ago" he said "well what grade are you in" I said "I'm in 10th" he said "I am too so now you will already have a friend." When we got to school dillion walked me to the office to get the stuff I needed then I went to my locker and we had our first class together.*after school*We was walking and he said "do you want to hang out some time" is said "sure" he said "do you have any thing to write on" I gave him a piece of paper and my binder and he wrote is number on it he said "text me"
