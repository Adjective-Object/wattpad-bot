Hi Dan, my name is Sophie Jay and I would like some advice. I'm 22 and I thought I had my life mapped out. My parents disapproved that I liked being a waitress. I want to put a smile on someone's face when I bring their coffee, or their breakfast when they are broken hearted. They took me for granted. My parents would always say that my job was useless and that I should be more of a lawyer. I studied law but once I was done with the course I was more relieved than motivated. Law is boring. You know it is too. Maybe I could've dropped out earlier and not wasted my time like you did. But I'm a moron, so I didn't. I am a fellow YouTuber, like you, but I'm not as successful as you are. I have about 85,000 subscribers and counting which is good. I don't want to be successful really. I would feel like I'm stealing all of the other YouTubers thunder and making it the Sophie show. I would let it all get to my head. I'm glad I'm not successful. But I'm happy for you and the others. You all handle it so easily. I recently fought depression. I was moody, I would cry myself to sleep and wouldn't forget to self harm. But with the help of your videos, I'm back on my feet again, I think. I just want you to know that I am grateful for your videos they help me so much. And a quick question, can depression change your personality ? Thanks- Soph ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Email sent
