---HetaOni Extra (Hetalia x Reader x 2P! Hetalia)---
((A/N: Since Wattpad doesn't have blockquotes, the words that are ITALICIZED in the RECAP are flashbacks! On the other hand, in the PREVIEW, the ITALICIZED words are events to happen in the future. Seems easy enough, right? xD I don't know how to make the whole flashback and preview things less confusing, so I hope you guys understand! Also, for those who don't want spoilers, just skip the Preview part~  Thank you!))


///Third Person PoV///


A slim Japanese man wearing a pure white uniform appeared and calmly spoke,


"Hello, everyone. It's me, Japan.

This chapter part will recap all the 11 Chapters of 'HetaOni (Hetalia x Reader x 2P! Hetalia)' that have been posted so far.

In addition to the recap, there will be some extra scenes as well as a preview of future developments.

We'll go over them quickly while (Name) and I add some commentary, so this is more like a revision and a guide for first-time readers.

Let's begin, then. First, starting with the prologue of the game."



--Prologue--

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=


Faint footsteps could be heard going nearer and nearer...


An Italian man wearing a blue military uniform ran through the roads and shrieked. "Eeek! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Heeelp!"


"Ack! You? Don't run away! ITALYYYY!!!" scolded his masculine German friend, who was chasing after the said Italian.

=*=*=*=*=


After hours of running away, Italy managed to get Germany off his tail. "Okay! Now that I've run this far, even Germany won't come after me~" he said proudly, feeling a sense of accomplishment.


"Training before the meeting...I was going to die! Hmm, I don't see anything familiar around here... Am I lost?" he looked around to check if he could figure out where he could possibly be. While walking around he saw a store that sold gelato, so he decided to buy some for himself. As he got out of the store,  he happened to pass by a group of students talking really loudly.



"Really?!" one of them exclaimed.
