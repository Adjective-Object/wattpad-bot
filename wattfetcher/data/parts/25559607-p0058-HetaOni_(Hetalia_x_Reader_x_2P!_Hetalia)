This is a memory from when I first reunited with Prussia, but...I feel as though I'm forgetting something...
Something is missing.)
Prussia: Hh! Who's there!?
Japan: Woah! C-Calm down! It's me!
Prussia: Oh, it's you Japan? Ah... Sorry.
Japan: (Something... something is different.)
(I reunited with Prussia and then we went to see Germany...)
Japan: What's the matter?
Prussia: Don't you hear the sound of... something...getting closer?
The Thing suddenly enters the room, shocking the two of them.
Japan: ... That's?
(It came in?!)
(Hold on, ____-chan's not with us here... She was the one who asked for the key to make sure... I see... The lock...)
The Thing began to charge towards Japan.
Prussia: Watch out!!
The albino pushed the Japanese man away from the bloody grey monster and took a harsh blow.
Japan: Oh!!
J: Prussia!!
P: Son of a--!!
Prussia defeats the Thing but...
Prussia: ...... Ow...... This is bad......
He collapses, blood gushing out of his body. My hands suddenly start to tremble.
Japan: Prussia!!
H-hold on!! I'll stop the bleeding with some sheets!!
Prussia: No, it's okay... I'm a nation... I won't... die...
Ah... but, I'm not... a nation any more, am I? I told you that...
Japan: S-stop it!! I'll call Germany!! Please, this isn't the time for jokes!!
Prussia: Are... West and... Ita... all right?
Japan: ......Yes.
Both have already left the mansion.We'll go home, too. Germany and Italy are waiting for us.
Prussia: Kesese! Yeah... We'll all go to your house...and go to... the hot springs...
Japan: (Because I wasn't with ____-chan... I didn't think of locking the door...so...Prussia had to...)
Japan: (But...____-chan was with me and... she did lock the door. And Prussia is alive... This memory... it must be fake.)
(I know which one is true. He wouldn't die in a place like this.)
The scene changes into an unknown room.
Japan: ?!
What's this room?!
Germany: Damn it! Even though the four of us got together, the situation hasn't got any better!
We're still locked up in here and that fucking monster is still after our asses!
Japan: (This wasn't supposed to have happened yet.What on Earth...?)
Prussia: West, don't be so pessimistic. Someone will eventually notice that some nations are gone, even if it's only a few, and they'll come to help...
