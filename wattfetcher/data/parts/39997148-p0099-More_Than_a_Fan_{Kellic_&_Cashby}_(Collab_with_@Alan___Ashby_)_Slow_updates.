Austin didn't say anything. I waited a bit hoping he'd say something before just getting my camera ready and walking off. I stayed for about half their soundcheck before leaving to the bus and getting into my old bunk and fiddling around with the pictures. I looked through the pictures deleting any that I didn't like and fixing up any of the ones I thought had potential when the bus door swung open and the guys all came in. I didn't get out but I just stayed in my bunk.
I wasn't in the mood for anyone, especially Austin.
I was already in a really bad mood because of Roy then Kellin helped me feel better only for me to get back into my pissed off mood.
"Alan?" There he was coming to fix things. I heard his bunk curtain open up, "Baby?"
"What to do want?" I said opening my curtain up.
"Look I'm sorry -"
"I'm busy." I said and closed my curtain and went back to looking at the pictures.
"Alan..."
"I'm busy Austin."
"Alan I'm trying to talk to you here! Isn't that what you wanted?"
"What I want is for you to leave me alone. I'm busy."
"Will you stop acting like a child and come talk to me!?"
"I'm not acting like a child."
"Really because it looks like you are." He said.
"Really I'm the one being a child? You're the one who snapped at me and said you didn't want to talk about it and to just drop it so I am." I said pushing my curtain open and glared at him, "So consider it dropped. Now like I said: I'm busy."
"Fine be busy. Ignore me. Be a child and work on your stupid fucking pictures." He said snapping again before I heard him walk off.
I rolled my eyes and slammed my curtain shut once more. I wasn't the one being a child, he was.
I didn't know how long I sat there before Tino came back, "We're going inside."
"Alright, I'll be out in a few." I told him and shut of my computer and grabbed my camera and everything else I'd need.
I got out and bumped straight into Austin's chest.
"Sorry." I mumbled and tried to walk away only for him to grab my arm and pull me back to him.
"I'm sorry." He said, "I'm just mad about this Roy guy. And I'm scared you're gonna leave me and go back to him. And you're not a child and your pictures aren't stupid."
"I'm not ever going to go back to Roy Aust, I found the perfect guy and I don't plan on leaving him," I told him. "And I'm sorry I called you a child too."
"I'm sorry for snapping at you."
"It's fine," I said.
"No its not. I shouldn't have done that."
"Well I forgive you, it's okay Aust. If that's the worst thing you ever say to me then we're just fine." I told him and reached to kiss his cheek. Just as I was about to kiss his cheek he moved his head and kissed my lips. I wrapped my arms around his neck as he pulled me closer to him. Sadly our make up kiss was ruined when Phil yelled at us to hurry up.
"Will you carry me inside?" I asked pulling away a little.
"Oh I guess." He said dramatically, I smiled and hopped up wrapping my legs around his waist. His hands went to my ass and held me up a little.
