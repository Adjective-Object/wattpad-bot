Hello minna! Another chappy. This one would be weird. Lots of flashbacks and... Onto the chapter!
———————————————-

Aya was paralyzed. With what, she had no idea. Fear, shock? Countless words could be used to describe the state of animate suspension that Aya faced.

On a Spring island.....

"Ba-chan, The Sakura trees are glowing!"
"Yes, Aya-chi. But remember, don't let anyone.."
"Dull my sparkle!"

"Oh and you have secrets of your own, Sakura. You're.." As Doflamingo told her past, all the painful memories came back to her.

"Come on, Asuka-chan, come have tea party with me." St.Marie asked.
"No, I don't wanna."
"Eh? then you can have it all!" St.Marie exclaimed as she sent he steaming hot water on the girl.

Sakura was tense and her muscles grew stiff. "You must have the wrong person." But her expression said otherwise.

"And you, Haruka." Doflamingo said turning over to hi,. Haruka, seeing the reaction of his collegues figured that Doflamingo did his research and he did it well.

"Haruka, not only are you hiding your status, you're hiding your bloodline."

Haruka's eyes widen with shock.

"Okaa-san, I brought you flowers." Haruka exclaimed walking up to a white haired woman who was sitting under a tree covered with snow.
"Thank you, Haruka." She said, gladly accepting the rare periwinkle.

"Are you happy, Okaa-san?"
"Yes. I am."

"Shut up!" Haruka shouted. Millie was more than surprised and she had a feeling that Doflamingo wasn't stopping there.

"Now, why not tell the whole world?"

It was like lightning. The way the trio snapped their heads up and moved.

First Aya appeared infront of Doflamingo (as she was using Soru) Gave him a kick imbued with Armament Haki, which had no effect since Doflamigo blocked with it with his own Haki.

Haruka: Spark X-Slicer.

With lightning speed, he appeared behind Doflamingo, him being stooped and his katanas in a X-position. Sparks of black lightning appearing on Doflamingo's chest.

Sakura: Sky Dragon's Tornado.
