"Come in" I heard an old man's deep voice.
I pushed the door and walked in.
"Hi" he said.
"Hello" I said.
"Leena Ahmed right?" He asked
"Yeah, how did y- Oh yeah the hijaab"
"Come in, take a seat" He smiled
I sat. well, Here comes the awkwardness, we sat for about 2 minutes in silence.
"May I know the reason behind your visit" He asked.
"Believe me, I don't know. Mrs.Peterson sent me"
"Hmmm... Mrs.Peterson, You must've done something wrong" He said calmly. He doesn't look like the mean principles on TV.
What I learned today:
1- TV programs are just a big lie.
"Sir, I believe I didn't. We can wait until the period ends, and then we'll be able to invite Mrs.Peterson to discuss that together. So is it Okay to go back to my class Mr.Sean?"
"I don't think so, the teacher is already angry enough, you can go out to the yard or watch a football game in the stadium, but promise me to be back before the period ends"
"I promise, thanks Mr.Sean" I walked out the door happily.
Walk alone in the yard or watch a football game and see all these sweaty teenagers ?
I prefer walking alone.
I sat on the grass and looked at the sky.
"Everybody needs inspiration, everybody needs a sole, a beautiful melody when the night's so long" I sang, yeah.
I know songs and music are not allowed, I know music is haram.
But sometimes I overhear them.
And I still remember some songs I have memorized when I was 12 or 13 and that was one of them.
"Your voice is gorgeous" I almost had a heart attack.
I stood up and saw a girl, Hamdullah.
"Thank you"
"Hey, I'm Helen" She extended her hand but pulled it back fast.
"Sorry I forgot that you don't shake" She said sadly and then, my hysterical laugh started ..
"W-what is it" she asked innocently.
"I'm Leena" I extended my hand and she gladly took it.
"I only don't shake males, or touch them, only if I was defending myself from physical attacks" I laughed.
"Oh yeah, good slap by the way" she referred to the slap I gave to Jake.
"You still remember that" I raised an eyebrow then bursted out laughing.
"People still speak about it, You're like a super woman to us, the girl that gave Jake the pain he gave to 80% of girls in school back" She giggled.
"It's my pleasure" I giggled.
"So, what are you doing here ?" She asked.
"I'm kicked out of class" I said.
"You sound happy about it" She chuckled.
