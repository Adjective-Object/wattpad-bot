"Thanks I guess."  He said and smiled, "You know, if you really like me you can carry me."
"Carry you?"
"Uh huh."
I laughed, "Alright get on my back."
He jumped on my back  and gave a kiss on the cheek. "Thank you."
"No problem."
"So where are we going?" He asked me.
"Its a surprise. I'm not telling you."
"Please, please, please."
"No we're almost there anyway." I told him. He groaned but stayed silent for the rest of the walk to the science museum.
When Kellin saw the sign he let out a loud squeal.
"Oh my god!"
"You're excited I assume."
"I'm so excited! Vic you brought me to the science museum!"
"Yeah I did, this is uh this is the kind of thing you like right?" I asked him walking up the steps.
"Vic this is perfect. I'm so excited. Thank you so much."
"Good, now I need you to get off my back so I can get the tickets."
"Right, right."  He said jumping down from my back and taking my hand.
We quickly got the tickets and Kellin practically dragged me inside.
"This is going to be so much fun oh my god! This is going to be the best!"
"I hope you love it."
"I do, this is going to be great! I'm so excited- I don't even know what I wanna see first!"
"Well we have time plenty of time."
"Okay um oh! I know what I wanna do first!" He squealed.
"What?"
"The electromagnetic stuff oh and then we can go to the planetarium!"
"Sounds fun, let's do it." I said squeezing his hand.
"Have I ever told you that you fucking rock?" He asked kissing my cheek.
We were there for couple of hours seeing everything that he wanted. He was so cute when he talked about this stuff too. His eyes lit up and he had a smile on his face while he spoke. Man I was so lucky.
And I learned that he's not just good at math, he's a freaking genius he knew all kinds of random facts about everything there and he was so passionate about it all. It was amazing and I loved watching him.
"Thank you for this date. It was amazing." Kellin said giving me a soft kiss.
"I'm glad you had fun." I said when he pulled away, "You know I still have like an hour left before I have to get to soundcheck, wanna go get some ice cream?"
"Ice cream sounds amazing."
"Great, let's go then." I said and squeezed his hand.
"Woo! Let's go." He said dragging me along.
I smiled, Kellin is absolutely adorable.  We got to the closest ice cream parlor.
"What flavor do you want?" I asked him once we walked inside.
"Strawberry."
"Gross." I said crinkling my nose but ordered it nonetheless.
