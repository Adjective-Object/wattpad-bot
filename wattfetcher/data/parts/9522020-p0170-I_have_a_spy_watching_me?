"Well, I need to go on and check up on him." Dr. Hendrickson said.
"I can help if it's more than one word sentences, you can ask him yes or no with his eyes." James said.
"What he means by that is I'll be asking you questions. You blink once for yes and blink twice for no. Okay, first, do you remember the girl right here?" He asked putting his hand on Clare.
I blinked.
"Do you remember him?" He asked talking about Tyler as he points at him as he is next to Clare.
Blink.
"How about these two?" He asks about my parents.
Blink.
"Good, now do you remember the two next to you?"
I blink without actually looking at Skull and Jaycie. He smiles at that, but then I shut my eyes and groan. My head hurts and is pounding.
"What's wrong with Chase?" Jaycie asked worriedly.
"His head is hurting." James said.
"We should replace your IV soon. That's probably why." Dr. H says. "Okay just a few more things Chase. Try to stay with me okay?"
I reluctantly open my eyes.
"Good, now do you remember what happened to you?" He asked.
I paused. Do I? That's when I remembered how I was just in my office talking to Tania and Skull when some freak tackled me. I also got a good look at him. I looked at Dr. H. I blinked once and he nodded.
"James I want you to help me this time. Just wait after my yes or no questions. Okay?" Dr. H says.
"Gotcha." He replies and goes next to Skull taking a seat since Skull is standing.
"Okay, Chase, do you know who did this?"
I look to James. James gets that and looks to Dr. H.
"He says he was tackled and someone used magic... Wait a second..." He says and looks at me. "Do you remember what he looks like? Because I think the same person did the same thing to Jaycie and even Paul."
I heard the heart monitor beep a little faster.
"Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. It's okay. I'm fine." Jaycie said but I saw her tears and I looked at James.
"Paul was taken and you've been in a coma for a month."
My eyes bugged out. I may dislike Paul a little, but without Jaycie and everyone knowing we talked and kind of bonded. Paul was really cool. He even apologized about the whole thing. I started to try and take the things out. Jaycie stopped me though.
"Stop. I already have Paul gone, I don't want you to go heroic on me and try to find my brother to only get hurt and back into the coma you once were." Jaycie said.
She stared at me and I couldn't just sit there. I wanted to go find Paul. I really did, but her eyes were begging me to stay. I relaxed then still feeling the tingling in my hand. She sighed and kissed my cheek.
"Thank you." She said.
"We'll g-get Paul b-b-back soooon." I said and she nodded.
"Now, shhh, don't talk." She said and I put my head against the pillow. The one time I actually have 1000 or more words to say, they tell me to shut up but when I have none they want me to speak? That's not fair! I groan again. "Are you okay? Is it your head again?" She asked concerned as she, yet again, caressed my face.
