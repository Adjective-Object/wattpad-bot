Introduction of OC:
Angie Takashi is the Seirin Basketball team's manager. She has long black hair and brown eyes. A first year student like Kagami and Kuroko. She is sometimes outgoing and happy go lucky but gets really serious too. She is just like a normal student but hides something from her friends that only a few certain people know about.
FLASHBACK
Things have just became weird for the Seirin basketball team. It all started in one faithful day....
The Seirin BT(basketball team) were travelling to a place to practice when a car crashed in front of them.
"Holy!" Kagami shrieked.
"What happened?! " Izuki startled.
"Guys, go." Angie stood up.
"Huh?" They all turned their heads to her.
"Hurry up! Go and run as far as you can go!" She shouted at the top of her lungs. They all hurriedly went out of the bus and ran away knowing that the car will explode.
Angie stopped and turned her head to the crashed car. Her eyes widened as she saw two children passing by the road. She turned her heels and ran towards them.
"Angie! What are you doing?!" Riko shouted.
"It's dangerous!" Hyuuga beckoned. However, she only shook her head and ran fast towards the children.
She covered them just in time before the car exploded.
"ANGIE!" They all shouted. She rolled on the ground because of the explosion. They immediately ran to her worriedly. Before they got there, Angie sat up and pulled the child from her body.
"Are you okay?" She asked nicely. The little boy cried a little and nodded his head.
"Omygod! Angie!" Riko shouted.
"Where's the other one?" Kiyoshi asked.
"Kuroko." Angie snapped her fingers and Kuroko appeared behind her holding the little girl in his arms.
"Thank goodness" they all sighed.
"Wait. How did Kuroko save the girl and how come you don't have even a slightest bit of scratch?!" Koganei asked confused.
END OF FLASHBACK
Since then, things have been pretty much weird and suspicious. Kuroko and Angie sometimes didn't come to practice. (Angie is the co-manager) however if they do they would sometimes cut it short or ask to leave before the practice finishes and They sometimes didn't attend school.
When they were supposed to have a practice match with Too, Aomine, Kuroko, and Angie weren't there either. Not because Aomine was being a lazy ass, he actually looked forward to that match(surprisingly). Even Momoi didn't know where they are.
All of those happening perked up their attention. And boy, were they so curious now.
'What have been Kuroko, Angie, and even Aomine been doing?' That very questions repeats everyday in their head.
Angie's POV
"Hurry up, Aomine! We don't have all day! Kuroko's already waiting for us there." I said to Aomine.
"Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute." I saw him load his gun and slung his bag over his shoulder before grinning.
"Let's go! " he then ran ahead of me.
'-sighs- it can't be helped." I ran also, following him before reaching a certain place and disappearing.
