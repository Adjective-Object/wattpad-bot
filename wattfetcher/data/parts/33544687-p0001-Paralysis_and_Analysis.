Tap. Tap. Tap.
There was a shuffling of exam papers and pens cluttering noisily together.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
The nearly nonexistent sound was much more pronounced and insistent now.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
Finally, an old woman in her forties looked up from underneath her glasses and peered at the thirteen year old students sitting in front of her.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
Her hazel eyes landed on a particular one. The girl had ruby red hair, tanned sun-kissed skin, and one green eye and a gold eye. This struck many people as abnormal, but they never questioned about it. Claiming it to be rude and critical.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
The girl was quite short as well, only coming up to everyone's shoulders; she was the shortest in the year.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
The old woman started. "Wilkie will you please stop that infernal tapping? You're distracting the other students." She snapped angrily.
The girl in question looked up and smiled sheepishly. "Sorry, ma'am. I'm just a tad bit stuck on question seventy four. I'll stop with the 'infernal' tapping." She surveyed the people sniggering around her and went back to finishing off her exam.
"Thank you, Jamie if you need help tell me okay?" She asked while stacking some of the lower years exams in a neat pile.
Jamie Wilkie nodded. She glanced at the clock for the time. Relentlessly she picked up her pen, ran through her answers and started to chew on the tip of said pen.
It's alright. Only three more minutes to go, Jamie. Then it's half term. Come on, you can do it.
The time seemed to take forever. Jamie looked two seats away and saw her best friend, Lucille Erwyn. She had honey blonde hair and bluey-red eyes. Jamie tried to catch her attention by waving her pen around wildly, but quietly.
Lucille glanced up and saw Jamie. She arched one blonde eyebrow and rolled her eyes.
Jamie shrugged noncommittally and grinned.
Lucille narrowed her eyes before turning back to her test she was doing. Jamie gaped a bit before looking at the clock again.
One more minute.. Ugh, I swear time is trolling with us.. No fair.
Jamie pouted before jiggling her leg up and down, bouncing erratically in her seat.
Some boys had turned to look at Jamie and were sniggering to themselves. One of them threw a piece of paper at her ankle.
Jamie bent down and picked it up. Unrolling it she flattened it out and saw what was written on it:
Hold your panties girl! We'll be going in a couple more mo'ents!
Jamie swivelled in her seat to turn to look at the boys who were now snickering silently.
She rolled her eyes and wrote a reply on the paper:
Looks like your boxes have already fallen off! I wonder if it's the air tickling you or something airier and wetter...
She chucked it at them and anticipated their responses.
The boys started to blush and giggle madly. One blond boy said he wasn't gay while a brown boy waggled his eyebrows at him.
