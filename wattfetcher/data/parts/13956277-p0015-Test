"What Am I gonna do now"...
for the first time, I felt lonely and hopeless.
I cried while I was walking until I became unable to see perfectly.
I bumped into something
"OUCH" I covered my forehead
"sorry are you Okay ??" familiar voice, I looked up.
"Tom??"
"Oh hey Leena, what are you doing here"
"oh uh nothing,bye" I turned around and walked away from him
"You're lost, Aren't you?"
I froze.
"maybe...." I sighed
"Come on, I'll get you there"
"What the heck man ? I've been after her for 2 hours she's mine" The guy who was following me in the car came back
"You want to go back to your mamma in one piece or in several boxes?" Tom threatened him.
"I could've handled him" I said aggressively
"your number will be a great way to thank me" he smirked.
I turned my heels and walked fast
"Wait wait Im just kidding, Where do you live, I can take you there"
"No thank you"
"I can walk with you, It's not safe here"
"No"
"stop being unreasonable, do you wanna get attacked by perverts?"
I thought for 5 minutes "Okay, but stay 6 feet away from me"
"Anything you want, Leena"
I rolled my eyes then started to walk
"do you-
"No" I cut him off
"I mean-
"No I don't date and I'm not with Jake"
"That's a good thing to know, but I was actually gonna ask you where is the place you live in"
I blushed in embarrassment, Tom noticed that and giggled
"uh I actually... well the problem is ..."
"Oh please don't tell me that you don't know where you live" he slapped his forehead
"Okay I wont"
"Oh god, So you don't know where you live! how am I supposed to take you there"
"Well, it's a big fancy house"
"oh really ? that helped a lot" Tom mocked
"It has a number maybe 6 or 66, It's colored in blue and has trees in front of it and it's only 20 minutes away from the school"
"these informations are not enough"
"Astaghferollah, What are we gonna do"
"you can stay with me till we go to school tomorrow and ask for your address from the principal"
I know that walking and talking with a stranger alone in the dark isn't right, but I had no other choice... At least he was protecting me :/
