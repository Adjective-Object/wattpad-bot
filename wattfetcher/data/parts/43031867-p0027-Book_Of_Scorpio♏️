Love
It's no secret that Scorpio is a staple for love. They often grow emotionally attached to people who show them a sincere and loving nature. Their passion is evident in many areas of their life but when it comes to love, it can be seen more abundantly. Pf course Scorpio loves money as well, but money can't love you back.
