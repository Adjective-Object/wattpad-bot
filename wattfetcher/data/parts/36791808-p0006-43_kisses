The party was going wild , I spent some time with Steve then I went to look for Zoe she was with Ethan , ugh do they always have to suck each other's faces "Hey Zoe , ZOE ZOE!!!!!" "OH sorry didn't hear you""Hey Im leaving I didn't really cancel the family thing , I just missed you" Ethan said "Aww thanks babe" he gave her a pick on the lip then waved at me and left
They are soooo cute, I wish I had a relationship like that
"So , now we get to talk about the hottie" Zoe said with a wink "What , who?" I was confusedShe gave me an "are you serious"look"STEVE , HE IS SO CUTE"and I'm blushing , I don't even know why "Yeah I guess he's good looking""You guys would make a cute couple""Zoe I don't like him this way, I just met him!""So , I saw you giving him your number , he would probably ask you out and kiss you and-"ZOE , NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN" "OK chill dude"We went to grab a drink , i really needed one , we were talking and laughing , i spotted Dylan he was talking to his friends i couldn't help but think about how perfect he is , his eyes are so cute and that smile WAIT WHAT?? WTF Mia you don't like him this way , I didn't even realize I was still staring until I saw him walking towards me and Zoe "Hey Mia why aren't you having fun , dance , sing , grab a dude and go up stairs , it's a party"He said that and left , I was really shocked to hear him say that last part"Your BAE is really funny , grab a dude , I think you should take that advise"
I laughed at BAE , but then glared at her"Zoe I'm not gonna grab a dude"-----------------------after the party-----------------We cleaned up , Zoe is staying at mine tonight , we watched some movies , even after a party Zoe is still up for a movieThen we went to my room to SLEEP I know we're not going to because Zoe is gonna keep talking , thank god we weren't drunk or it would have been a disaster"I enjoyed the party , did you""Yes Zoe I did , but now I enjoy sleeping""You're no fun" It was silent for a bit I thought she finally went to sleepThen my phone buzzed , she literally jumped "I knew it , YES YES!!""You knew what , why the hell are you screaming Zoe""I'm sure it's Steve , check your phone come ON""Okay , shut up"I grabbed my phone,it was Steve Hey cutie , I enjoyed the little talk we had maybe we can try it again some time xx Steve"Shit""What is it , let me see the text "She read it then "OMG FINALLY , YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE" "WHAT I never said yes to his offer""But you will this is so exciting we can-"Zoe I'm not saying yes , I told you I don't like him "There was a knock on the door "Girls SHUT THE FUCK UP what's with the screaming" nick said-screamed"Sorry" "Zoe go to sleep we'll take about this later""Ugh , fine"
OK so this is kind of a filler chapter I know you're sick of (how they started) haha but trust me it's not going to last for the whole story
