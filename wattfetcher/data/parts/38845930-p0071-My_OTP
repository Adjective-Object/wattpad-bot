"Yeah, I guess I am."
We ate breakfast and relaxed for a while, I almost fell asleep but Jordan started talking... luckily.
"How do you look so cute all the time?" He asked.
"I don't know what your talking about." I said.
"Yes you do." He said as he knelt down next to me.
"I do not know what you are talking about, Jordan." I said.
"Yes you do, shut up." He said putting his face on my hand.
"Jordan, I -- really? No, but thank you."
"I love you, you know?" He asked.
"I love you."
Jordan and I lied there for a while just looking at each other making ourselves look like weirdos. I grabbed Jordan's hand to tell him I loved him and as I moved my arm, I hit my funny bone and got a shooting pain down my arm. "Jesus!" I screamed.
"What? What happened?" He asked.
"I hit my funny bone on the couch somehow." I chuckled.
"Ouch." He said.
"Ow." I laughed.
"Stupid couch." Jordan said and he punched it.
"Well that ruined the moment." I said rubbing my elbow.
"Oh, poor baby's elbow." He said.
"What?" I asked.
"I don't even know." He said.
"You're so weird." I said.
"But you love it." He replied.
"That I do." I said making us laugh before I kissed him.
