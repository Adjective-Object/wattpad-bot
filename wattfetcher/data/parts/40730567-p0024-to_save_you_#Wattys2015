They asked me why I couldn't let go of you, the thought of you. The thing is nothing makes me happier than you, and nothing makes me sadder than you.

Jake didn't want to believe it, but he had no other option. Brielli talked exactly like Night did. She was the girl who had made his life better. But he didn't understand. The girl who had secretly made him actually tolerate life, was none other than someone he thought he hated. He thought she loved all the attention, that she loved being under the spotlight. This didn't look like something she would do. So he did the only thing he knew.

Look I get it that the girl is you. But guess what? I don't have any freaking feelings for you. Even yesterday you were that girl I hated, and after finding out you are still the girl I hate. Your obsession with me doesn't change a thing. So please stop fucking messaging me now, bc I like sky. I don't have any feelings for you whatsoever, you can just go die, for all I care.

Jake knew it was wrong of him to say that, but he had to. He couldn't manage to get close to another girl, after his ex-girlfriend, Adalyn died.
