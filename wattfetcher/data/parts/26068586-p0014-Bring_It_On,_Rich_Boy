Mine? Does he mean his house?
That means I will get to see Ken.
This is too easy.
***************
I was about to walk to my next lesson when I saw Ash and Lia talking by the lockers. I lead back on the wall and listened to them.
"What the hell are you doing?" I heard Lia's voice boom.
"What do you mean?"
"Why is that new girl going to your house?" she asked getting frustrated.
"You mean, Sky?" Ash asked innocently.
"No, I meant the Earth," she said sarcastically, "now answer my question."
"She's just coming round, we're not going to do anything..." he trailed off, "well unless she wants to."
I could hear the smirk in his voice making me roll my eyes.
"I don't want you anywhere near her."
I scrunch my eyebrows in confusion. Excuse me, bitch?
"What the hell is your problem?" Ash snapped back, "I get to choose who I see and who I don't, stop acting like my mother."
"Your mother? If your mother was here you wouldn't even be acting like a pathetic jerk," Lia shouted and there was a moment of silence, "Ashton, I'm so-"
"No, you know what, say what ever you want I don't care about your opinion on Sky," Ash said sounding kind off pissed.
"She's not good for you, please believe me!" she cried, "there is something about her, Ashton, she's going to break your heart, please listen to me!"
She's trying to turn him against me!
Argh, if I had to kill someone, I would kill her first.
I peaked my head round to see what was happening.
"You don't even know her," Ash said before turning round and walking the other way.
"Neither do you!" Lia protested grabbing onto his arm, "what about Maria?"
Ashton stopped dead at his tracks and stood completely still. His whole body tensed before he pulled his arm out of her grips and stormed away, leaving Lia in tears.
I started to walk away.
Who the hell is Maria?
Is she his girlfriend? It can't be, he's never mentioned a Maria girl.
Well who ever she is, I'm gonna find out.
**************
I was driving home when I saw Ash's car turning the corner. I got curious so I followed him.
It's better to know where he lives now right?
I followed him into a hotel parking lot and parked my car far from him so he couldn't see me.
What is he doing at a hotel? A really expensive hotel as well.
He got out the car and started to make his way into the hotel so I followed him. He went up to the receptionist and she handed him a key.
Does he live here?
I followed him till he entered a lift.
I quickly pushed the door leading to the stairs open and ran up the stairs as fast as I could. I check if he came out the lift every level but he didn't until it got to level 20.
