"Gotta love that Ji-Ji VegaPunk." Ace stated sitting on one of the many lounge chairs surrounding the area.
"Agreed-yoi."
At that moment, Sakura and the others walked in. Ace noticed tat out of all of them, she was theonly one fully clothed without showing her back. Of course he knows the reason why.
"There's your girlfriend-yoi." Marco teased.
"She's not my girlfriend Just my sister!"
"Sure, keep telling yourself that."
However, Ace wasn't the only one there. Kid and crew just happened to be there. Law was resting on Bepo and Luffy was eating the restaurant dry.
"Aya, I didn't know that you'd show." Hancock greeted calmly.
"Hancock!" Aya exclaimed running up and hugging her. At that time, Hancock was wearing a two-piece purple bikini which had the Kuja jolly roger on her left breast which was yellow.
In the midst or all this Nami, Robin and Sakura disappeared to do their own exploring. Robin sat under a tree and read that new book she bought. Nami went shopping for new clothes and Sakura went to try out the pools.
Sakura dipped her hand in the water and instantly felt weak. "Definitely not Morphix Water."
In the distance, Kidd saw her body lying on the ground near the edge of the pool and decided that he wanted to have some 'fun'. Sakura heard him coming. His boots went 'clank' against the floor and it was a sound she was quite used to.
The only reason why she couldn't escape from Kidd that moment was because she dipped her hand in the water. Kidd grabbed her by her hair and held her over the pool.
"Since when do you cover your back?"
"Since when do you mind my business?"
"I asked you first."
"I asked you second."
By this time, Kidd was getting irritated and honestly, the thought of ripping out her vest was not a bad idea.
"You rip out my vest and I'll kill you." Sakura threatened. Kidd was beyond irritated. This brat was pissing him off.
"You shouldn't piss me off." Kidd spat into her ear, pulling her hair harder. Sakura winced in pain before curtly adding, "I've been through worse."
In the flash of a moment, Kidd ripped off her shirt and in that same instant, she bit his arm so to the untrained eye, it seemed that Kidd ripped off her shirt then dropped her into the pool.
"Sakura!" Ace yelled.
"Damn that bitch, she bit me." Kid hissed as he held his bloody hands. Meanwhile all this, Sakura was slowly sinking into the deepest part of the pool. Everyone in the nearby vicinity was panicking as most of them were Devil Fruit users. That problem was solved quite easily when the sound of someone diving in the water was heard.
Haruka swarm as fast as he could but stopped when the he saw the mark on her back that she tried so desperate to hide.
"Haruka, whenever you see someone with this mark, respect their greatest wish and try your best to hide it." A white haired woman explained to Haruka showing him her mark as well.
Haruka brought Sakura back up to the surface but this time with her back facing his chest.
