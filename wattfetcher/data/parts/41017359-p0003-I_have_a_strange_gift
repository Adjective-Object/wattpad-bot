"Aiden! Please come down here!!" Mommy calls. "O-O-Okay!" I call back. Me and Jodie walk downstairs, once I get to the last step, I see her crying and she picks me up right away. "I'm gonna miss you!" She says in-between sobs. "Mommy! It's okay! And what do you mean?" I asked. "Oh. R-Right." She said, carrying me to the table. "We kids have something to talk about when Daddy gets home, K?" Mommy said. "Sure." I replied. I could sense Jodie knew what was happening, she started breaking things. "Is that Jodie?" Mommy asks. "Yes. I think she knows what's wrong but I can't understand her. All she does is growl. I don't understand her, but she understands me." I say, my eyes glazed over, which means Jodie has taken over me.
JODIE'S POV
I get up, and run upstairs. "Aiden!" Susan calls out. I ignore her. "JODIE!!! LET ME BE ME!!!" Aiden calls in my mind. I growl. Aiden then gets back in control and hits his head to get me to stop.
AIDEN'S POVThank god that's over. "AIDEN!!" Mommy calls. "Coming!" I yell back.
I run downstairs, and guess who I run into. My dad. "Aiden. I'm really sorry, but you have to live in that paranormal department that I took you to a few days back." He cut straight to the chase. My mom started crying. "So, you're telling me that I can't live with you, and I have to live with a doctor I just met?" I ask, confused. "Not exactly. You'll be monitored 24/7 by a girl named Dr. Nicole." Dad said, annoyed. "Oh. When am I going?" I say, trying to hold back tears. "Tomorrow."
