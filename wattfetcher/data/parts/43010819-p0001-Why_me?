This isn't a story about some girl who lives with an abusive brother. This is the story of a girl who lives with depression, an abusive brother, a distant mother, and a father who has no shame in favoritism. This is MY story. This isn't a book, I want you to understand that. Every chapter is going to be a setting I have actually been in, and I will be writing it from my perspective. This is not a joke, or a book. These things have ACTUALLY happened to me, so please be respectful. Spread the word. For all you know, it could save someone close to you. So read on, respect, and share.

Again, in case you missed it, the chapters are going to be situations I was ACTUALLY in, and I will be like a narrator. Please respect this. The word of domestic violence needs to be spread, here's how I'm going to do it. Read on, and thank you for taking the time to read this. Every read this story gets might just be one step closer to stopping domestic violence. Please be respectful and share this story. Share my story. Because this can happen to anyone.
