It's said that you only learn from your own mistakes. Too bad it happened to me. But, things might have gone worse.
I tried to let go of my religion to become free. But I actually let go of my life.
I realized that freedom isn't about wearimg shorts, drinking, clubbing.Freedom comes with huge responsibilities.Freedom is being capable of making your own life by making the right decisions.
Islam had never handcuffed and won't ever handcuff anybody. Whiskey and beer are not allowed because of their bad effects on brain functions.Women are supoosed to cover themselves up to protect themselves. Plus, precious things are always covered.And love ... Love is allowed,  you can't  control your feelings, but the things we do in the name of love... Those are not allowed. You can't have a boyfriend,  kiss him and touch him and then blame everything on your feelings ... That's why you are told to lower your gaze, so you don't get much affected by the other gender and do what I had done. But, love isn't only between two different genders, love your parents, your family, your friends. Love isn't about holding hands or kissing. Love is when your mother stays up on her feet to make you dinner. Love is when your father stays up all night and works hard to provide money, food and a decent home for you. Love is when your friends stick by your side when you're weak.
Everything has a reason, nothings is forbidden without a reason.
Only if you take a look at your prize for following Allah's orders.
Paradise ...
Only if you knew what's in it.
In paradise, if any kind of food crosses your mind, you'll have it in a plate in front of you.Rivers of honey.Endless life.You won't suffer anymore.You'll live happily ever after ... There's much more In heaven/paradise that nobody has ever seen, heard of or even imagined.
Some facts cannot even be imagined, and you'll always reach a point where you don't have an answer ... Then, go to the Holy Qur'aan, it has all the answers.
...
I only had two choices : I'd either continue living my life the way Satan tells me ...Or I'd live the rest- I mean 'save' the rest of my life by living it the way Islam says.
I couldn't handle anymore mistakes, I was so thirsty for praying, for reading Qur'aan and for Allah's forgiveness.
Only if you knew how great Allah is, he forgives everybody for any and every sin. All you have to do is Istighfaar, just get back to the right path and you'll win Allah's forgiveness and heaven.
