I'm actually surprise this one got out next. I thought it would of 2-3 chapters but I guess I was wrong. Now I don't normally like Rarity songs. Not because I have something against Rarity or anything, its just that most of her songs get annoying very quickly. However this song was pretty good. Anyway if you voted this song out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
SO MANY WONDERS
SMILE SONG
BBBFF
MORNING IN PONYVILLE
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
LIFE IN EQUESTRIA
PINKIE'S LAMET
MAKE A WISH
MUSIC IN THE TREETOPS
THIS STRANGE WORLD
A FRIEND FOR LIFE
AJ'S LALLABY
Good luck to the nominees!
