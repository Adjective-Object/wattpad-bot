"Bye mom"
I yell as I run to catch the bus. Life is good. Its the last day of 8th grade. High school is coming and I am so excited.
I hopped on the bus and sat with Jonie (my best friend since...forever).
"Hey" she says
"Whats up" I say a little winded from the running.
" Are you excited!" She says almost jumping out of her seat
"OMG yes!!" "Summer!"
"No" she says with a face of disapointment
"What your not excited"
"You forgot!!!!!"
"Forgot what" (I had no clue what she was talking about)
"My birthday. My birthday party is in a week!!"
"Ohhh right !" I had totally forgot
"Yes I remembered . I got you the best gift ever" I lied
The light returned to her face as the bus jerked forward. We talked the whole way to school. About high school, makeup, driver ed, summer etc.
I walked with Joni to Mrs. Millers classroom. They whole day we talked and did little work sheets about candy and measuring a dog pen.
RING! The bell rang. It. Was. SUMMER. Kids swarmed the exit running to their parents cars into freedom. Jonie and I walked to the bus talking until our ears fell off and we couldn't talk any more. I jumped off the bus and went inside the house.
"MOM IM HOME!" I scream
"Hello sweety" my dad says as he gives me one of his bear hugs.
He used to be a construction worker. He was strong and loved bear hugs.
"Hi girly" mom called down. I came to the bottom of the stairs to see her. She has safety pins in her mouth and ribbon and fabric in her arms. She is the head of a big fashion company. She's trying to finish dresses for a fashion show next week.
I went to my room and listened to music while I drew picture. I still have no idea what im going to get Jonie. Maybe tommrow I will have an idea on what to get her. Im going to close this entry here and write tommrow.
