"Sarah,you need to get up." Ren said,(more like yelled.)"I'm up." I groaned,sitting up."Really,it looks like you're still in bed." He said,as I shot him an annoyed look.I got up and dressed,and headed done to the gym. Today,was Friday,which meant we didn't have classes,but I had training. Locksmen had made Logan my new trainer,considering I never really had a trainer. Logan was in there,without a shirt on, and was swinging his sword around like it was the easiest thing ever.I put my bag down and the leash of Pip down. I got Ren out of his sheath,and looked again at Logan,who'd put his shirt back on."It seems you showed up." He said smiling."It seems she did." Ren said,knowing if he could move his mouth he'd be smirking.Logan backed up,shock written all over his face,and I almost laughed,almost."Sorry," I smiled apologeticly,"he gets irritating.""He talks." Logan said."Didn't you hear me talk the first time." Ren said rudely."Ren!" I exclaimed"Ok,so your talking sword's name is Ren." Logan says."Yeah,I didn't name him,"I smiled,"a goddess did."Logan smiled,"You ready to train?""As ready as I'll ever be." I saidSo for that's what we did for the next hour. I couldn't beat him at sword fighting, so we went to hand-to-hand combat. He pinned me to the ground,smiling,which I really wanted him to stop that. His smile made the world light up in different ways,and I found that weird because we are supposed to be archenemies.Locksmen's words kept running through my head"you two are both from royal families and you need to set your ancestors mistakes right."I ended up smiling,which made Logan laugh. He let me up,and sat down beside me after I was on the bleachers."Thanks." I said"For what?" He asked"For helping train me,even when we hate each other." I said,smiling to myself."I'm not sure anymore,about hate." I heard him mutter,a small smile formed on his lips. I pretended I hadn't heard him mutter that and instead just talked to him.
