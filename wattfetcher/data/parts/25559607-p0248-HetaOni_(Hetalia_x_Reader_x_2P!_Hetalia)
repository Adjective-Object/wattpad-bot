With a trembling thumb, I pressed the button on the screen and answered the call. Placing my phone to my ear, I spoke,

"H-Hello?"
The other end of the line went silent for a while, until I heard a familiar voice.

"(Name)?......It's me."
I dropped my phone.

"(N-Name)-chan? What's going on?" Japan called out to me as he heard my phone land on the floor with a loud thud.
I looked at him with a shocked expression on my face before turning to the ground to pick up my phone. The call was still on, and I raised the receiver to my side. I heard someone panicking on the other line,
"Hello?? (Name), dear? Are you alright???"
I felt tears welling up my eyes as I took in a deep breath and chuckled, "...Ehehe....Yes, mom. I'm fine. I'm fine."
"Oh thank goodness you're okay! Honey, we've been so worried about you!" my mother exclaimed, relief evident in her voice.
Unknowingly, a tear slipped down my cheek. "......And I've been worried so much about you guys, too. So much."
"(Name), dear, we're at the front yard of the mansion--would it be alright if you come down by the window? I know hearing your voice over the phone takes away our worries, but your father and I want to at least see you. Even if vaguely." she asked.
I nodded to myself and remembered the window where Italy was able to see Austria before. "Of course, I'll be there in a few." I said as I placed my phone in my pocket, not ending the call.
"Guys, I'm gonna go outside for a bit." I told them.
China turned to me and asked, "Your parents, aru?"
"Yes! I can't believe I'll finally be able to see them--even just through the window." I told them excitedly.
They smiled. "Would you like us to go with you, dudette?" America asked me.
"No, it's fine. I'll be by the windows in the other hall on this floor." I said, shaking my head and reassuring them that I'll be alright. "I'll be right back, I promise."
"Alright, but at least take this with you..." Japan said as he handed me a sword. I tilted my head. "Oh, but, it's a limited edition...so please be careful with it--and, ano,Â  you be careful, too, of course." he told me with an uneasy expression.
Placing the strap of the sheathe of the sword over my shoulder, I smiled. "Thanks, I'll take good care of it. And I'll be cautious, too." turning towards the door, I spoke, "Well, I need to go there now, I don't want them to worry again."
"Be careful!" they called over as I exited the saferoom.

I peered nervously through the window. Some of the windows were covered with floorboards and grills, making it quite difficult to see the outside, but this particular window had just enough space to let me see through. It was the same window where I discovered my parents outside from before.
