I walked down the frozen food section. Humming along to the song playing in the background. I guess I got carried away and started singing because Chiara began to laugh hysterically clapping and rolling.
"Hey my singing's not that funny." I poked her stomach laughing.
Once I got to the frozen Pizza's a small light skinned lady stood in front of it.
"Umm, Excuse me ma'am." I smiled.
She turned around quickly holding her chest.
"Lord Jesus did you scare me , sorr-." She held her chest with her mouth opened.
"Is there something wrong Ma'am ? Should I get help?" I asked worriedly.
"Oh sweet baby jessus, Serenity that you?" The middle aged lady asked.
How the hell did she know my name?
"Umm I'm sorry, If you don't mind me asking how do you know my name?" I asked raising my eyebrow.
"Renity, It's mama. Mama J darling." She embraced me in a hug.
Oh my God? What in the blue moon?
