A nurse rushed to Leena, then she was taken to a room, I followed them, the nurse stopped me and didn't let me get in, I tried to push her but she started shouting and talking in Arabic, "I SPEAK ENGLISH, SHE'S MY COUSIN" I shouted back, she probably understood and believed the lie, I got into the room and watched the nurses checking if she was Okay, Leena didn't wake up, they checked her blood pressure and her breath, I guess it was fine because the doctor sighed ans smiled, "How is she?"    I asked the doctor, "Who are you?" He asked, "Her cousin" I lied again, "You can't fool me, get out of the room", "No please let me stay" I begged, "Listen to me, no matter what's going on betwee  the two of you, you seem foregin and dont know how the things go here" The doctor pushed me out.
I sat on a chair beside my and Leena's bags, wondering about what happened, my brain couldn't understand everything that was going on. Poor Leena, she lost both of her parents at the same time, "Leena !" I looked at the one who called her name, A man stood in the reception, shock was obvious all over his face, he looked a lot like Leena's father but he was mush younger, about 25. The man ran while his tears were falling, I followed him, he got into her father's room, but it was empty, the man stood frozen in his place, he turned around and walked to Leena's room, I peeked through the door and he ran to her and kissed her forehead, Leena opened her eyes, "Karam" She said and hugged him, Leena said something and they both cried, I knocked the door and walked in, "من أنت؟" Karam said, "Sorry, I speak English", Leena sighed, "I TOLD YOU TO STAY OUT", Leena shouted, Karam stood up angrily, Leena caught his hand, "I'm sorry Simon, but can you get out, I want to talk to my uncle, alone" She wiped some tears, "Why ? I don't understand anyway" I said, Karam kept glaring at me while Leena was talking to him, I heard her saying my name few times, when she finished talking, Karam stood up and raised his hand, I prepared myself for a punch, but he hugged me instead, "Thank you for taking care of my brother's daughter and protecting her " He said, "What did you tell him?" I asked Leena, "I told him about the way you kept defending me and protecting me from Connor and the others, and how you were like a brother to me, I also told him how you converted to Islam two years ago" My eyes widened, I mouthed a what? To Leena, her uncle couldn't see because he was still hugging me, "I'll explain later" She whispered and I nodded.
.............
We went to Leena's house, it wasn't a house, it was almost a mansion, I didn't know Leena was too rich, but neither did she, surprise was obvious on her face when her uncle stopped the car in front of it.
"Get the bags, I'll hold Leena to make sure she doesn't fall" Karam said,I glanced at Leena who was in complete shock, her face was pale and her eyes were puffy, "Okay". Karam guided me to a room in the first floor, "You can stay here until you get back to America" He said, "Thank you" I hugged him, "I'm sorry for your loss" I said and Karam sniffed and patted my shoulder before he left.
Day 1 of the funeral:
I woke up at the voices of screaming and shouting, I opened the door and saw women, kind of old, screaming their laungs out, Leena was sitting on a couch, she was all in black and crying silently, My phone rang, it was Molly, "Hi" I answered, "Are you there yet ? How's everything going? How are Leena's parents" Molly asked and I sighed, "Not fine at all, we were late, both of them passed away" I tried my best to answer her, mom pulled the phone from Molly, "Simon, how are you son? I miss you", I took a deep breath, "I'm fine, how are you mom?" We talked for 5 minutes then I hung up, the women were still screaming, I looked at Leena who was looking quite angry, Leena stood up and shouted something, all the women went silent, I opened my phone and opened the application that I had downloaded the day before, it translates the words you say, I repeated the word Leena said and the translation popped, it was "Shut up".
