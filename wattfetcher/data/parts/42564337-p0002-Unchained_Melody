And by the blink of an eye, they grow up, subconsciously building a wall between one another. They're both in their teens and have their own personal struggles they need to cope with.
Louis is still fully oblivious as ever, as Harry's existence still isn't acknowledged. Louis tries forgetting everything that happened, an imaginary friend wasn't important. Only little kids have imaginary friends. 'I'm not a little kid! I'm turning 17 this year!'
Harry doesn't try talking to Louis either, but not for the same reasons. School is a higher priority. He has to think about lots of more important things. Harry happens to think about Louis once a while.
The two boys being complete opposites seems horrendous, but is it really?

A/N; This was a very short prologue as I didn't want to drag out Louis and Harry's introduction as characters. All other chapters will be longer than this, I promise!
