You may think that I'm just another spoiled brat who has so many boyfriends because of my looks. Well, that's not the case.
No one finds my green eyes and straight brown hair attractive. No one likes my personality. Except my only 4 best friends.
I'm not another suicidal girl begging for help. Well, not yet. I'm just another 15 year old girl searching for that someone who will give me a chance.
This is me. I am Arielle Espinosa.
