I looked down at my phone while walking down the street. I was busy texting, read bugging, Vic about when he's gonna come up and visit me, when I accidentally bumped into somebody causing me to drop my coffee. "Oh crap. I'm really sorry." A familiar voice exclaimed. I looked up to see the face of one of my bestest friends."CC?" I asked sided eyed, excited to see him after so long. "Umm. Do I know you?" He asked confused. I looked at him weirdly before remembering."Oh right." I laughed. "It's me Jeri. I dyed my hair, got snake bites, and a couple tattoos since I last saw you.""Oh! Jaaaashaa! I missed you!" He picked me up an hugged me. Stupid long legged chuppy. "Oh my. Let me get you a new coffee." "I run the café you know." "Yes, I'm still getting you a new coffee.""Okay then... Are all the guys in town or is it just you?" "All of us but they are out places. I'm headed to the café now. I've missed mom." "CC back riding?" Questioned hopefully. "Sure." CC crouched down so I could get on."Yay!" I hopped in him."onward Comacorn!" I giggled as he chuckled at the weird looks everyone was giving us. He just started walking in the direction of the shop. I had dyed it bright blue and I also had gotten snake bites. I usually wore them either both or one at a time and always lip rings. I've had these piercings for about two years. WHY CC LEAVE ME SO LONG?!?!?!?! "MOM I BROUGHT A WILD CHRISTIAN COMA!!!!" I yelled when we entered the shop. Clint turned around from his seat at the bar and gave me a weird look. I patted Cee's arm twice signaling for him to let me go. I slid off of him and moved to sit behind the counter. "Hey Clint." I chuckled. "How's the wife?" "Doing good. Nathan's fairing okay." "That's sweet. Gotta picture?" Clint smiled and showed me his phone. "Awe it's so cute. This is my friend Christian." I pointed Clint to CC sitting a few seats down. He raised his brow suspiciously. "Just a friend Clint." I rolled my eyes. "Cee! Get ova here!" I waved him over. "Ya'know Clint I will never understand why you come here." I chuckled. Clint cleared his throat before he began. "You have the best coffee and food in general and all the people who come in are very interesting." "So what we talking about?" CC 'gracefully' plopped down in the seat in front of me. I rolled my eyes. "What can I get you, Coma?" "Your usual and a Danish." I grinned at him and got to work but gave him the Danish first. I sat down in front of him again and Clint wander off to chat with people. A couple of BVB fans that were here started chatting with CC.I took my coffee and headed to the back stage practice room for some quiet. Yep. This is going to be interesting.

~#~#~#~#~#~#~ Jeri~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~#~##~~#~##~#~#Mikey waltzed into my practice room where I was laying on the floor in silence. "Ummmmmm where's the bathroom?" He asked kinda awkwardly, from seeing me on the floor. "I'm bored. You bored? Let's go on a road trip!" I grinned like a psycho at him. I jumped up like a boss a sauntered up the short staircase to the stage and walked to the mic. "HEY DUDE WERE GOING ON A ROADTRIP!!" Everyone looked at me weirdly. "Skylar! Get the RV! Niki! Bag my buds! Mom, watch the shop!"There was a loud thud as an RV fell in front of a store with a banner on it that read 'have a great road trip Sky!' Skylar, on the other hand, shuffled to me and handed me keys before slowly walking out to the RV. "I called all your friends. They should be here soon." Niki stood in front of me as I sat on the edge of the stage. "Thanks Niki." I leaned over and ruffled his hair before hopping off the stage. I ran over behind the counter the that one place where I hid two fully stocked and packed suitcases. Actually, you'd be surprised at what I've hid in this café. I also grabbed Skylar's suitcases and dragged/carried them out to the RV. I kissed mom's cheek. "Nikki will help you with the shop." I informed her. "Be nice to Lori for me." I sent her a wink. I gave Lori a polite nod as I walked out of the shop and into the huge, decked out RV. Slowly but surely Skylar slowed out of her grogg whiled we waited for our friends.
