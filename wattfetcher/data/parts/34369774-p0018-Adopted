Hey guys u know it's been years since I last wrote a chapter and I'm so sorry.  A baby from my church decided to take my phone and drop it in a cooler and I write my story on my phone. And get this. She started laughing after she dropped it but it's okay cause I got a new phone and I'm never letting anybody touch it. Bad news though. I'm putting this story on hold.  I'm gonna continue to write June 26 a.k.a. last day of school. I'm sorry, but I'm just so busy now. Plus I don't even know if this is a good story because nobody comments or anything.  Anyway bye snickerdoodles I'll see you in a few months
