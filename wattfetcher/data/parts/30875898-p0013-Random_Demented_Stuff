I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm happy, I'm proud, I'm confused, I miss you.... Garret....
I'm mad because it wasn't fair. Why him? He had so much more life ahead of him. He wasn't even an adult yet, for God's fake!!
I'm sad because he left. Maybe I could have helped, gave some happy words, told him how many people would miss him. Too late, and now I'm crying.
I'm happy, as sadistic as it sounds, because he's okay now. No one can hurt him, or call him names, push him around, or make him cry. He's in a better place now, he's happy now.
I'm proud because this boy has a hell a lot of courage. Garret, you did something that many people can't even begin to think about. This proves to all of those dumb-ass's that you are stronger than they think. You seeked out your happiness and found it, you won, not the bullies.
I'm confused because I know why he did it but I'm not sure why. I know he did it because of the bullies and all the other shit in his life that I didn't know about. But I don't know why he didn't talk to anyone. He knows how many people love him to pieces, so why? I wish I knew... I wish I could wake him up and tell him he's amazing and he doesn't have to do this.
Dammit Garret!! I fcking miss you so much. I hope those people who drove you to the edge, fcking suffer. They stole an inoccent life, they deserve it, don't they?!? And not just any life, but yours Garret! This isn't fcking right, God damn!! I'm just going to be in my bed all day, mourning. Then I'm going to smile because I know he wouldn't want anyone to be sad that he's gone. He'd want them to be happy that he's moved on. Miss you buddy, hope you're smiling now.
