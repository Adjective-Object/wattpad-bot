"Well, now, let's go back. We're all tired. Let's call it a day..." Japan told us, wiping sweat from his forehead.


China stretched his arms and spoke, "That's right! Let's go to sleep!"


"Hey, dudette! You were perfect back-up a while ago! I didn't know those riceball-thingys would give you back so much strength!" America beamed, ruffling my hair a bit.


France walked up to us to join in. "Oui~ Even though I prefer wine, the beer you told me to drink gave me so much energy. Merci, fille!"


I shrugged for a while and gave them a small smile, "Well--"



"Don't thank her just yet."Â  we heard a voice from the end of the hall.


A voice. A familiar voice. A voice that I know.


England stepped closer and looked where the voice came from. "Who's there? Show yourself."


At that, the door at the end of the hall opened, revealing...people that every one of us would recognise.


The Second Players.


One by one, they stepped out of the room. People who look like copies of the countries I was with, but with alternate colours of hair, eyes and skin. There were only five of them, but they were enough to give off an aura of danger.


This caused the First Players to take a few steps back in pure surprise...and horror.


"It...can't be..." Japan uttered slowly.


Silence filled the hall, allowing us to hear the heavy footsteps of the man who owns the voice we heard a few moments ago. He was the last one to slowly exit the room.


That man had auburn hair, piercing magenta eyes...and a smirk that sends chills to the spine. On his right hand he held a switchblade....on his left hand.....he held.....a very large....sack.....


My eyes widened in horror. It's impossible, right..? That sack...inside that sack..... It's not like..... It's not.....



"......My....pa.....rents.......?" I choked out, tears forming in my eyes.
