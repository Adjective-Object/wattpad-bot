"Fine, but remember that I tried to tell you something" Simon left leaving me in deep thoughts guessing what he had to say.
Days later, everything was smooth and going well, much more than well actually.I succeeded in making many students convert to Islam, not I but WE : Tom, Molly and Me, it wasn't easy at all but it was worth it for sure.
I was making breakfast for Karam who had been in America for two days, "I wish I came here earlier" Karam yawned as he was staring at the half naked girls outside our house, "Astaghferollah, shut up and pray Fajr first, then we'll find you a decent wife instead of those girls" I slapped his arm then threw his plate in his lap, "I'm not into having a serious relationship at the moment" He sighed, "If you are not ready for a serious relationship you are not getting into any relationship. And I thought that you were wise" I mocked but then felt sharp pain in my stomach and screamed, "LEENA ! ARE YOU OKAY?" Karam jumped off of the couch, "Yes yes I'm fine don't worry" I wasn't going to let him suspect anything or drag me to the doctor, "Okay, fine .... How is Simon ? Have you seen each other ?" I felt electricity run through my whole body, Oh yeah, her's fine and about to become a father, thanks to me ... NO I was not going to say that.
"He's fine, I see him in school sometimes" I said then a train of flashbacks hit me.
When we first met ...
our first touch ...
when he hit Conor for me ...
Our first kiss ...
When he caught the sheep for me ....
THE SHEEP ! When I cooked and took the food to the orphanage ! The orphans ! How could I forget !
"Karam, I'm going out, there's something I got to do" I left before he could even answer me and headed to the dead building, colorless hood and burnt trees, everything seemed to be cold, sad, begging for help, waiting for a hero to bring back the light to it, it was 12 am but seemed to be 12 pm.
I might had done many mistakes and let my parents down, but there is one thing I would never do : Ignore someone that needs help.
I stared at the wooden door, I was about to knock but I saw Nina shooing me me from the window of her room, I heard footsteps, ran and hided behind a bush until I saw the woman responsible for the girls getting out.
I got inside, things were different ... Much worse than before. Nina ran to me crying, "He took my sister" She sobbed, "Who ?" I hugged her, "The man that was with you the last time you came here" Nina hugged me tighter, "What ma? WHAT ! SIMON ? NO WAY !" I gasped ! No one came with me beside him and Damon, and the last one was Simon, "No way ! Impossible" I covered my mouth in shock, "You should leave, she's coming back soon" I pushed the door then headed to my car and pulled the door forcefully and drove furiously to Simon's house.
How could he ?
I knocked on the door, I almost broke it, "Take it easy" Simon opened it, I couldn't hold myself, I caught the hem of his shirt and pushed him to the wall, My face was so close to his, he was shocked while I was furious, "HOW COULD YOU?" I pulled him closer to me then pushed him back to the wall forcefully, "WHAT'S WRONG" He pushed my hands away but I caught him again and pushed him, he tripped and fell, "HOW COULD YOU USE HER ? AFTER EVERYTHING I HAD TOLD YOU? I ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOU FELL SORRY FOR THEM AND WAS ABOUT TO HELP THEM TOO" I ignored his scared sister that was staring at me like I was some sort of beasts, "Hi" I heard a soft voice, I turned my head around and saw Nina's sister smiling at me, "Thank God you are Okay, let's go" I pulled her hand but she didn't move, " I've been asking Simon about you hours but he didn't answer me" She said, "I brought her here yesterday, I came up with a plan and needed her help, there is no way to catch them without a help from someone from the inside of the orphanage" Simon stood up and fixed his clothes. You know that feeling when you want to shoot yourself in the head? Yes, I had that feeling. I felt my cheeks going on fire, I didn't have words to say, "Since you are too busy to care about those poor girls" I wanted to jump off a cliff at that moment, "I-I thought that ..." I played with my fingers while my cheeks were burning and my tongue got tied, I coughed few times "Sorry" I whispered, "Yeah fine" He stretched his neck few times and groaned, "Uh, you might need some ice" Molly brought some ice and gave it to Simon, she didn't scold me because she knew that what I had done was nothing comparing to the baby he gifted me.
