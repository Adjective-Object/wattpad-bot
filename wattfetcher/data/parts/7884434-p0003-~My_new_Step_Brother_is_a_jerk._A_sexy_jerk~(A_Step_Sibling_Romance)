"You shut up and drive! I want to get out of this car. This was stupid!" He said angrily
"THEN WHY DID YOU COME?" I yelled.
"BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER THAN SITTING BACK AT YOUR HOUSE WATCHING YOUR MOM SOB AND MY DAD COMFORT HER! ITS DISCUSTING!"
"Looking at your face discusts me" I spat
"Please! Everyone knows I'm attractive! Don't lie to yourself!" He said with a smug grin. He was right. He was attractive. Beautiful eletric blue eyes, black shaggy hair, beautiful milky skin that looked so soft, a nose ring that was sexy as hell, he had that 'emo' look. That was what girls in my school found attractive. Yeah we like muscle but who could resist sexy 'emo' boys! It was impossible!
