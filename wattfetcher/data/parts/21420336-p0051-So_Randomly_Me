Let me tell you about two of the questions
"Civil war quiz

2. Sherman marched to disney world"
Shes so amazing xD
She has ADD
Shes my role model
Its like I took two seconds to facepalm because pf this question and this kid raised his hand and was like
"Disney World, Ms . Gordon? Really!?"
Some kid put it was true
Hes such an idiot
