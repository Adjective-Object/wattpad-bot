Cora:
"SURPRISE!" I heard the Lynch's and even Ellington cheer and popping confetti canons. There was a huge banner that read "We've Missed You Corabee!" I remember that nickname. That's Rydels name for me.
"Cora!" She screamed and hugged me. I squeezed her tight. "I've missed you so much!" I buried my face in her neck. "I've missed you to DellBell." Next was Rocky and Ryland who lifted me over their shoulders. "Yo! Not cool!" They put me down and I hugged both of them. Stormie and Mark hugged me then Ellington came up. "So you're the famous Coralynn." I giggled. "And you're the even more famous Ellington Ratliff." He laughed and hugged me. "I feel like I know everything about you from these guys." He said pulling away. I blushed and looked down. I was a little taken back when someone lifted me from the waist and spun me around. I turned around and started playfully hitting Ross! "Not fair!" He laughed and grabbed my wrist. "Can I talk to you outside?" I nodded and followed him to the pool.
He stood in front of me and grabbed both of my hands. "I- I was too scared to ask you this earlier but..." Awe!! He's blushing. "Will you be my girlfriend?" I smiled and lifted his chin. I brought his lips to mine and lightly pecked them. "I thought you'd never ask." He smiled and kissed me again. Then we heard the click of a camera. "Awe! Roralynn! I love it." Rydel. I laughed and buried my head in Ross's neck to hide my blush. He hugged me and kissed my head. "Really Dell?" He asked with a small laugh. She nodded and walked back inside. "She's gone." I lifted my head and kissed his cheek making him go red.
"Cora." He said after a few minutes in his room. "Yeah?" My head was on his lap and he was messing with my hair. "You're beautiful you know that?" I covered my face with my hands. "No I'm not." I sat up and faces him. He moved my hands from my face. "Coralynn Marie Dillard. You are the most beautiful girl I've ever met. And I love you so much." I blushed and buried my face in his neck again. "I love you too." He rubbed my back. "You don't have to be shy in front of me, sweetheart. I'm not just your boyfriend, I'm still your best friend. I'll always love you for you dating or not." I just nodded and sat up.
"What do you want to do, darling?" He asked after a few seconds. I shrugged. "What time is it?" He checked his phone. "Eleven forty five." I closed my eyes and snuggled up to his chest. "I'm tired." He chuckled. "Let's change." I nodded as he took off his shirt and handed it to me. He threw his shorts across the room as I slid on his shirt. It went straight to my knees since he's like twice my size. I'm 5'2" leave me alone. He saw me and chuckled. "Awe! You look adorable in my shirts." I stuck my tongue out as he laid next to me. I cuddled up to his chest. "Night love." he kissed my head as I closed my eyes. "Night babe." Than I slowly drifted off dreaming of the one and only..
Pizza.
