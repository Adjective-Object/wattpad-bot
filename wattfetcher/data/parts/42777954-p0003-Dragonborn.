The next day passed horribly slowly. She was sent back and forth across the castle after Elenwyn, to serve drinks or fetch another member of the royal house for a debate. She hadn't the time to over think her and Anson's plan. By the time night fell and she finished running Elenwyn's bath she was exhausted, but it did not serve to temper her excitement. She waited until moon-high, spending her little bit of spare time raiding the larders once more. This time however she did not take with reserve; she filled a burlap bag with smoked meats wrapped in oil paper and fresh baked breads and even a couple of pounds of butter. When she finally snuck out to meet Anson she was weighed down by her bag of loot, but her feet made no sound and she blended with the shadows as if she had been born of them.Anson was waiting for her as he said he would be and the green light of his palm showed her a pleasantly startled face as he caught sight of her provisions."Good job Katya." He commended her, taking the bag and rapidly dispersing the foods between his and her saddlebags. The horses stood silent and still as he worked, obviously they trusted him well, so much so that they did not even protest when he slipped burlap bags over their hooves to muffle the sound on the packed earth in the courtyard.Unlike a traditional Bosmer home, which was grown from a tree, Loxias lived in a manor he'd had built over fifty years previous."Here, put this on." He tossed her a boy's tunic and a pair of trousers; both articles were worn with age and smelled of must. "They were mine when I first came to this wretched place, and they'll be much more comfortable to wear on horseback."As Katya changed he turned respectfully away. And then he helped her onto her horse whispering into the beast's ear in a language that she did not know or understand. To the Nord's surprise the horse nodded it's head as if to agree with him."What did you say?" she asked, wide-eyed."I told her to stay behind me and to run for Elsweyr if I am to fall behind.""You won't." Katya replied stoically, "We're both going to go to Skyrim and be free."Anson smiled "I hope that you're right."He mounted his horse and they began their escape.
