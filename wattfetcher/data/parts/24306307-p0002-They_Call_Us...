"Mrs I did nothing I didn't speak for the entire class" I argued
"Mr Hemmings do you want detention"
"No but-"
"Then apologise"
"Sorry" I mumbled
"Michael and Ashton you have detention tomorrow for disrupting my class and Luke you will show Calum around before any of us could open our moths to argue Mrs Hickey left the class room.
"Come on newbie" I said and Calum followed me out of the room like a lost puppy. I could hear Michael and Ash complaining about their detention behind me and I internally laughed at them.
"Okay" I said turning to face Calum "this is a school you go to class do your homework and try not to get in trouble. You follow your timetable and if you get lost they gave you a map to help you find your way. You can sign up for all the usual activities they have in schools. That is it"
"Thanks?"
"Bye"
"Wait!"
"What now?"
"Can you show me to the music room"
"What happened to your map"
"Nothing I just thought you could show me"
"Fine but only because that's where I am going"
We walked to the music room in silence. Once we got to the room I went straight to my seat at the back and Calum sat somewhere in the middle of the class. I didn't speak to him for the rest of the day.Okay so the chapter song is going to be on every chapter and it is the song I listened to while writing the chapter it may or may not have something to do with the chapter
