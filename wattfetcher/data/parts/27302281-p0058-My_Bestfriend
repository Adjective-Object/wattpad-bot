@ the mallWe were currently walking around the mall and multiple guys were staring Kylie up and down and she just smiled at them one of the cashier even asked for her number and I was holding kylies bags yay helpful boyfriend we walked into forever rue or forever 21 I don't remember the name it was pointless and many other girl stores i wasn't interested so I just went with the flow and Kylie turned to me and smiled and I flashed her a fake smile and she smiled wide and we went to other stores and she bought more clothes and handed my more bags I put bags into bigger bags so I didn't have multiple bags then this chick walked by and she winked at me and I just smiled she was blonde and skinny and quite attractive and may I say so had curves in all the right places. " you want me to go get her number for you " Kylie asked quite pissed and crossed her arms and she took her bags and slapped me and people stopped to stare and I glared at them and they just kept walking
" take me home " she yelled I could tell she was gonna cry
" just keep quite ok before you draw attention " I said walking out the mall with kylie
"Why are you all a sudden rude " she asked I rolled my eyes
" who is he and why are you smiling at the cashier " I asked her when we finally got in the car
" who is who " she said looked at me like she didn't know who I was talking about
" quit the act its not fooling me " I sneered She knows who I'm talking about and she's playing dumb like she didn't even know him I pulled into my driveway and Kylie started yelling at me
" I told you to take me home " she pouted
"Stop being annoying and come in so you can explain why you were with him then I'll take you home " I said sincerely getting out and watching her slowly follow behind me I opened the door with the key attached to my keychain and turned the knob and pushed the door open and stepped inside with Kylie following slowly behind she shut the door then sat down on the couch patting for me to sit so I did and she sighed and frowned
" who is he " I asked this time softly instead yelling
" who justin I still don't know who your talking about " she sighed
" the guy you were hugging when I came back from the bathroom he kissed your cheek " I said loudly not quite screaming but enough to make her move in her seat " my cousin" she yelled in a disturbing tone " your jealous of my cousin I can't believe you" she said loud enough to make the hairs on my head stand up and my eyes widened
" babe I'm so sorry I just don't want to lose you I'm sorry for being a jerk and for that blonde and everything else I'm so sorry " I apologized sounding like a broken record then she said the unthinkable
" I think we need to take a break " she breathed heavily then stood up and opened the door and looked over at me " take me home now" I nodded I promised her if she explained I would take her home I wish I could make her stay she's my everything I can't lose her but I just possibly did so yeah I drove her and dropped her off then drove back home and made my way upstairs then pulled out my guitar and my song book and sung a song I knew all to well and started to sing it
