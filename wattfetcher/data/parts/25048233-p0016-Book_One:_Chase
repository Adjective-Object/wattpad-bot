“I’m a freaking minor! I don’t drink!”
“It’s just wine. Don’t worry. It’s healthy for the body. Hahahah!” The principal gave me another urge. I can’t believe that a principal is encouraging a minor to drink.
“O-ok. I will have one sip and I’ll go home after.” I gave-in. I just want this to end.
One sip was made into three, into five until I finished the entire bottle. I kinda’ liked it! Despite the bad smell, the taste was really good. Is this why the adults love to drink? I get it now! “Hey Ice! Give me another bottle!”
Ice hurriedly passed me another bottle. My head is spinning now and I can’t clearly see. Everything is a blur and the sounds are barely audible. I don’t care, I’m loving the feeling.
“Hey Chase, are you sure you’re gonna’ be fine? I mean, you drank a lot already.”
“Tell me one thing Ice. Why do you love me?” I didn’t expect that to come from my own mouth. I can tell that it surprised Ice as much as I did. But instead of brushing the question off, he embraced it.
“Well, there are no specific reasons. I just know in my heart that… I love you.” He blushed. It’s weird but I know this was not the first time I’ve heard this from him. Déjà vu?
“Eh. I thought you were just playing around… If you’re really serious with your feelings about me then let’s have a date tomorrow.” I don’t really know what I’m saying but I’m pretty sure it’s because of the alcohol. “Maybe, see if it will work out or not?”
“…” Ice did not say anything. Instead, he just smiled and looked at me in the eyes. I can tell that he was really happy on what he heard. He leaned closer and closer to me. I can now feel his warm breath and it smells so good. He held my hand and continued his advance. I blacked out as soon as his soft lips started touching mine.

“…” I feel my face burning. Did that really happen last night? OMG.
“Do you remember now?” He gave me his signature smile again.
“I-I d-don’t r-remember such things!”
“Yeah. It did happen. Not to mention how you tried to puke all over me after we kissed.”

“…” Oh god. Noooooooooooooooo!
