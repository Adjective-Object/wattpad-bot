•in this Sarah Paulson and Jessica Lange are dating already•
•Sarah's POV•I slowly sit up to check the time on my alarm clock, it's 3am and I still can't sleep. I unwrap Jessica's arms from my waist and climb out of bed. I make my way down the wooden stairs and walk into our kitchen. I make myself a cup of coffee and sit down at the marble island in the middle of the room. After I've finished my coffee, I go to the living room, turn on the TV and catch up on real housewives. •3 hours later• Once I've finished watching housewives, I decide to make breakfast for me and Jess. I begin by putting some bacon on and then make scrambled eggs. I put the toast, eggs and bacon on two plates, and make us both some coffee. I put our food on a tray and take it upstairs to where Jessica is asleep. I walk into our room and set the tray down on the dressing table, I make my was over to Jess and gently shake her "Jess...Jess... I made you breakfast" I say, here eyes slowly flutter open, and she sits up. "Morning beautiful" she says with a smile on her face "morning baby" I reply. I bring her food over, and her face lights up. "My favourite breakfast, Thankyou Sar" she says. I make my way to the left side of the bed and we both eat our breakfast whilst talking about what we have to do today.
