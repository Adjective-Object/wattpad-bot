"We gonna do it anyways."
"For sure." I said and he left out the room to get Devin dressed.
I went downstairs to finish making Dwayne's bag and packed a bit of snacks for him.
"Baby I didn't make breakfast ." I said as he came downstairs with junior.
"It's cool. We can pick something up if you'd like." He told me and I nodded.
"That's fine."i told him and we left out.
After we had breakfast, we went to Devin Juniors new doctor.
"Mr and Mrs. Thomas I am Dr. Kelmen." The doctor said as he came in.
After we got through with the normal questions and answer procedure, taking Juniors height, weight and everything else.
"Excuse me, could you be gentle with him please?" I asked the doctor as he got ready to give him his shots.
He nodded. "Oh of course." He smiled
They got on with the shots and he didn't even cry. To say I am relieved is an understatement.
"Mommy big boy did so good!" I said and kissed on his chubby cheeks.
"Yeah, he did good. Now all we got to do is eat and get ready for his party." Devin said as he got into the drivers side of the truck.
"Let's pick the girls up."
"Okay." He said and kissed my lips when I got into the car.
"Love you." I told him
"Mm I love you too babes." He said and we were on our way.

The Video in the M/M is the doctor and how he gave the baby shots. I thought it was cute and had to add it.
