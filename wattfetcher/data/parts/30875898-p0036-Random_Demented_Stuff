I love to see the blood
When I put slashes on my wrists
The red liquid tells me that I still exist
I love to see the blood
When I put a knife to my arm
It doesn't matter what you think, it does me no harm
I love to see the blood
When it pours out of my wounds
And I love to see it pour like a red typhoon
