Beethoven: Good point.
*Mozart draws a vagina on Chopin's face*

Mozart: I'm not.
Beethoven: You'll see when they wake up.
*Mozart draws a Hitler Mustache on Chopin; also writes "I have Lisztomania" on Liszt's face*
Mozart: Heheheheheheh...
Beethoven: Man, if he actually had Lisztomania, he would be a f**king hoarder.
Mozart: True.
GPS: We have now arrived at your destination.
