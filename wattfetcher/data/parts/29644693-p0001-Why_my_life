I hear my alarm going off I roll over and glance at the clock " shit I'm goi g to be late " I jump out of my bed and grab my clothes and run to the shower and take a quick shower and dry my hair and leave it natural. I grab my keys to my car and my book bag and run out the door  . I start my car and speed down the street and continue down the road . Once I arrive at my new school I park my car and walk to the school and I glance and see people staring at me as I walk . Once I walk into the office I notice a boy staring at me with his jaw slightly open , he has a couple tattoos and snake bits and very beautiful green eyes . I walk by him and flash a smile at him as I walk into the office I see another boy walk up to him and smack him . He was very tall and skinny but very cute ' what am I thinking no guys ' I think to my self . I get my schedule and start walking down the hall then I feel someone put there arm around me a grab my schedule. Hey what the fuck is your problem give it back ? I try to grab it but he runs off and I follow him . As I am running down the hall I fell someone grab me and pull me Into a room . I see that same boy from early the one with beautiful green eyes . What is your fucking problem? God someone woke up pissed today he said . Why don't you fuck off "I said . He smiled and said " I'm Zacky and who you might be "? " Elizabeth but you can call me Ellie " I smile . " so where are you going first ?" He asked " history " I said  . He grabs my hand and guides my down to my classroom . " this is going to be a good year " I think to myself .
