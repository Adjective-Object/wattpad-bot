"You think that you know everything? That you're the best girl in the world? that you can come here and judge everyone? you think that you have NO flaws? that you're perfect, Look at you, you are so .... rude" His tune sounded aggressive.
"No,No,and NO. I'm not the best girl, I don't judge people ... I've just described what I see in reality, and No, I'm not perfect and Yes, I DO have flaws. but I try to fix them because nobody is perfect but at least we can try our best to be, but because we are humans, we do mistakes, we take wrong decisions, we fall, we break, but we can always try again and make up for our loss and mistakes. Being perfect isn't just about the looks, it's about the manners. and one more thing ... I'm not rude, I'm just straight with guys. So because I'm not easy, because I keep a straight face in front of them, don't like to flirt or joke with them and because I defend myself, don't let anyone cross the lines I drew and because I answer sharply when I get offended or angry ... you call me rude ?"
He remained on silent for 20 minutes.
"You win" He gave up.
I entered the fitting room.
"I like the way you think" He said.
well, well, well ... are my ears clean enough? or is there a problem with them ?
I guess not.
"I love the way you don't" I laughed at my hilarious answer ... not hilarious much ? Ok :(
"The person can't just simply complement you" he sighed
"Sorry I was just kidding. Well, thank you. That was nice of you" I kept trying clothes.
After 15 minutes of silence ...
"Hey" Lewis and Elina said
"Hey" Damon said
"Where is she?" Elina asked
"She's still trying clothes, I swear I'm getting old here" Damon sighed and I laughed.
"Did you overhear our conversation ?" Lewis asked
"No, You're just too loud. Elina come here I wanna show you something, I'm in room number 6"
I heard her footsteps .
"Girl, that red backless dress looks fabulous on you" She smiled
"Yeah, I have no idea how that got between the clothes" I looked at the mirror
"I CHOSE IT" Damon shouted and came running with Lewis but Elina closed the curtain and blocked the way.
"Where do you think are you going, young men" Elina asked
"Uh please ! just a snaek peek" Lewis begged jokingly
"Shut up and get back to your seats"
"Ugghhhh fun ruiner" Lewis and Damon whined in union
I put my original clothes on and walked out holding the mountain of clothes I wanted to buy.
"A little help please" I begged while my knees were shaking.
"No, I'm giving you a taste from your own medicine" Damon said.
"FINE" I pulled myself together and walked to the cashier.
The girl looked at me with her widened eyes.
"I know" I nodded.
"329 dollars"
"WHAT" The three of them shouted in union.
"You take Visa cards ?" I asked and she said "yes".
