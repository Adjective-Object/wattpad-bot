Finally the dinner was over.. I couldn't wait at the end to get back to my room. Niall was in the shower and Harry was texting me about the dinner. "What happend?" He asked me. I looked at my phone and didn't saw that Niall was out again. "It's Ash.. He stared at me all the time and I didn't feel comfortable about that.." I texted back and smiled to Niall. He smiled back and found his clothes. -Nialls POV-I guess she was texting Harry since she was staring at her phone all the time. I sat down on the bed and looked at her. She didn't even notice.. I decided to let her be at the room alone for a while. She deserves a break from us now. I walked out and down in the lobby where I met Luke and Ashton. I walked over to them and Ashton was looking at me with a weird look. What did he think about now? "Hey Ni" Luke said and smiled. I smiled back and sat down next to him. "How's Maybelle?" Ashton asked shy looking down on the floor. "She's good thank you.. And please don't ruin that" I said maybe a little to bitchy.. He looked at me and looked kinda sad. I don't care about that because he deserved to hear it from someone else than Maybelle. I don't care if he gets sad, because he broke her heart. She really loved him, but everyone can tell that Harry is her true last love and I hope they will stay together. I don't even know if they are a couple now or just trying to make it work.. -Maybelles POV-Niall had went out and Harry had also went out. He was going to talk to someone. Guess it was Ashton and I wanted to know what this was about. I got my shoes on and walked down in the lobby seeing Harry and Ashton behind the door.
