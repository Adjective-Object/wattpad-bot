Yeah I speak to my own mind .. yeah I AM stupid ... Aaaaand  weird a bit .
Now what ? Am I going to stay here forever ? And sleep on the cold hard ground ? Then wait until me hair becomes white ?Oh NO ! I don't even have the address of the house I'm about to live in, "ya Allah sa'ednii" (God please help me)
"LEENA AHMAD .. LEENA AHMAD" I heard a white black-haired girl calling my name, shukran ya rabb (thank you god).
I ran to her, "Hey That's me " I smiled widely,I hoped I didn't freak her out.
"Oh hey, I'm Elina .. I'm the one you'll be living with for the next 2 years" She said then suddenly hugged me, "I've always wanted a big sister" She said after she pulled away.
"Awwh .. and I've always wanted a little sister to take care of" I smiled warmly.
"Come on .. Mom is waiting outside" Elina literally dragged me out of the airport, that girl got some muscles! And what's wrong with people today ? Dragging me from a place to another ?
"Hey Leena, I'm Mrs.Carter" The tanned woman shook my hand, "Nice to meet you Mrs.carter"
"Oh please call me mom" she hugged me. Am I much of a hug-able person ?
"Come on mom let's go home" Elina poked her mother's shoulder.
Mrs.carter drove the black range rover for about half an hour, then my mouth hung open when we stopped in front of a huge house.
"Shut it before you drool" Elina mocked then got out and took my bags.
"y-y-you live here ?"
"yeah" Mrs.carter giggled.
"And I-I'm gonna live here too?!"
"No, we saved the dog house for you *insert sarcasm* of course you are going to" Elina said then dragged me into the house.
"Le'mme show you your room" Elina pulled me and ran to the second floor, then pushed a big brown wooden door, "TARARARAAAAA" she giggled.
"Ma shaa' allah" I said while my eyes were scanning every inch of the huge room.
"What did you say?" She looked confused.
"Uh, it's an Arabic word Muslims say when they see something awesome, too pretty, or strange .. I don't know how to explain it well" I answered.
"Oh okay, tide your things and make yourself comfortable , I'll be in my room, it's beside yours"
"okay Ell" I smiled
"Ell ??" she asked enthusiastically
"Sorry, you don't like it ?" I frowned, " I love it " She hugged me tightly then walked out
*2 hours later*
"ELINA AND LEENA .. Come down to have dinner" Mrs.Carter shouted from down stairs I ran down and sat on the dinner table.
"Hungry Ha ??" She giggled, "Way more than you think"
Alhamdu lellaah, Mrs.Carter made some "halal" food, she made beans and rice.
"Elina, keep some food for Damon and Harold" Mr.Carter filled our plates.
"Awwhh you got dogs ! I like dogs! I said enthusiastically and Elina and Mrs.Carter laughed loudly, weird.
"Anyway, thanks for the food ... Mom"
She gave me a warm smile "You will love it here" she hugged me.
I went upstairs and jumped in my new bed.
