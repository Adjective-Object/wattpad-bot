"I'm here to see how Bella is." Connor sat down next to Kevin and lifted the dog out of his lap gently. "How are you baby? Uncle Connor's here."
"Uncle Connor?" Kevin asked with a small smile playing at his lips.
"Yeah, you're her dad so I'll be her uncle. Although, for the record, if we were both her dads, I'd be the fun one."
Kevin rolled his eyes and watched his dog squirm around in Connor's lap.
"I've got to take them to the vet, Bella needs to be checked out and I want to get Fritz looked at too."
"Poor babies." Connor said sadly.
"Can you come with me? Please."
"How come?"
"For a worst case scenario where I need emotional support."
Connor took Kevin's casted hand and gripped it in his own. "I'm here for you Kevin, you know that."
Earlier that morning Kevin had made and appointment with a posh veterinarian in lower Manhattan and at two in the afternoon he and Connor set out to get Bella the help she needed.
Unfortunately, in a rush to get Bella help, Kevin forgot to grab his phone. He didn't know where the vet's office and know he had no way to Google it. Just their luck, that Connor had forgotten his phone in his other pants.
Connor approached a city tours stand and shamelessly asked for directions while Kevin blushed with embarrassment and made sure the guide knew that they were not tourists.
The guide wrote directions to the office on a sheet of paper with their logo on it. Kevin scoffed at having to carry it around but this wasn't about him, it was about helping his dogs.
Eventually, Kevin and Connor found the veterinarian's office despite the cluttered streets and informal directions.
