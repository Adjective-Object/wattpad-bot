Our hands connected again and we went to the elevators. We were the only ones inside. I pressed the button for the top floor and waited. It felt like the ride was taking forever until there was a ding and the doors slid open.
James waited for me to compose myself before we stepped out.
We walked down a long hallway, stopping in front of the doors to the suit that were guarded by two of the hotel staff. "I'm Juliet Sanders." I swallowed the lump in my throat, fighting to keep my voice steady.
One of the staff looked at James, "He can't go in."
"He stays or I go." I snapped.
The staff exchanged a look and one went inside the suit.
How important is this person? Now I'm positive this can't be Paxton or Michael. I don't know who the hell this could be.
The guy came back with a look of annoyance, "He'll see both of you."
James made a snarky comment as we were let into the room. He brought us through the sparkling suit and into a sitting space that overlooked the city. The back of a man's head was in my line of sight.
No white hair.
Which means it's not Paxton.
"She's here." The staff guy announced.
The one sitting on the couch quickly rose.
And I would rather be staring at Paxton's blue eyes instead of the man with my eyes.

Two updates in two days, yay! haha. I probably won't be updated for a few days because of my final tomorrow. Maybe this weekend.
Did you guys expect that though? :))))))
Thanks for reading! :) Let me know what you think of the story so far? If it's going too slow, I'll try and speed it up, haha.
