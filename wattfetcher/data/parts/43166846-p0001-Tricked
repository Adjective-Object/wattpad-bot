BELLA'S POV
Hi I'm Isabella Williams, but I go by Bella. I work at Victoria Secret as a model and I've become big I guess. I mean everyone in the modeling industry says when people know you by name you getting somewhere. Anyway let me explain some things, I'm 17 so I shouldn't really be at vs but I'm turning 18 in 3 months and they really wanted me there so they made an exception. I'm 5'6 with dark brown hair that reaches mid back and light green eyes.
I'm sort of known for my butt a little bit since when I meet guy fans they always ask if they can feel it which I politely deny since I don't want them feeling me up. Most people say I have curves but I don't really see it, but lots of my friends say I do which is why I'm so successful in my carrer. Oh and did I mention who my best friend is. Megan Richard, we met at a photo shoot and at first she didn't really talk to me but now she comes to me with everything. Anyway that's a little about me.
AMANDA'S POV
I'm Amanda Smith, and I absolutely hate Isabella Williams with a passion. I'm way hotter than that skank, yet she just slept around enough to get where she is now. The only reason I'm friends with her is so people know who I am and so I can find some dirt on her. So far all I know is that she is way too happy. She acts like a damn puppy and is way too innocent. I tried to convince her to drink beer but she refused to and told me how it ruins your brain and she wants a healthy brain.
Anyway I'm 5'9 with blonde hair that goes to my butt and blue eyes. I'm very skinny and should be at vs instead of that bitch Bella. Like yeah she's cute and all but she's not me. I could totally fuck a guy on set for a photo shoot and be fine with it, but she would refuse and leave. That's not how models should be, I had fuck 3 guys at once so I could get a modeling job, but they just gave it to her as long as she wore the bikinis for the line.
