To be perfectly honest with you, I don't want to have my "Gift." There are many things wrong with my talent.
1. My mother decided that I should fulfil the prophecy when I was two, not when I was ten, like the prophecy states.
2. My gift allows me to defy death, which may seem great an all, but the amount of times my life has been put on the line, is uncountable.
3. I can loose control, killing everyone in my path.
I was too young to understand the powers buried deep inside of me, I don't even know them myself. All I know is that they are dangerous, too dangerous for anyone to understand.
I am Henley Diggory and I have a gift.
