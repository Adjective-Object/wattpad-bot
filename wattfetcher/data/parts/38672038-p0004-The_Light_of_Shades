I was about to apologize to ole' girl but she won't even know what I said."Terensu anata no o shiri o mo~tsuImu tsukare" She said.Ion een' know what language. "Bruh ion know whatchu' saying." He looked hella confused." Kami kuso watashi no ƒÅ, terensu." She said in gibberish. I can't deal with T stupid ass. He over poppin' his tongue and waving his hands in the air.
"Ching Ching Dong?" T said, trying to sound like a Asian. I was roaring in laughta'. This nigga bout stupid as hell."Oh my god Terrence I said 'Bring your ass Terrence and Oh my fucking god Terrence." She sighed in frustration. She real pretty I can say that and she foreign. Ion know how the hell she related to Terrence ugly ass.
After they had they lil argument, they left and went home I guess. I can still hear his ass poppin' his tongue and saying Ching Chong, Ding Dong. Then he said "You eat meow or roof roof in your country?"
I chuckled a little before laying down in my bed. See I refuse to be homeless, sexy, and look like a bum. I would ratha' be sexy,sexy, and sexy. Its just that simple. Ion know how Terrence fresher than his sister but ugly and His sister uneven and dusty but sessy as hell. She don't get the word sexy right now cause a little off standards so she sessy.Ima shut the hell up na' and go to sleep.
Boring but I got something stirring in the pot.Make sure you add this book to you library and tell your friends to read it guys.PS: I used Google translate cause I'm a boss.
