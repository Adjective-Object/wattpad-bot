Jake had appeared to the party late. When everyone was eating. His eyes roamed around the backyard, inspecting the place. He saw Skylynn, and smiled at her when she caught him looking. He walked towards her slowly, taking his sweet time. But as he got closer, she walked inside the house, swaying her hips in a very seductive manner, which was turning Jake on. Skylynn turned and gave him an almost shy smile, and continued walking upstairs. He grabbed her hand when she was about to walk into the room, where all the girls were sitting and talking.
This was the perfect time to find out if Skylynn was Night or not. He quickly typed a message and sent it to her.
Sender: Jake
To: Night
She loved him and she made him love her. It was that simple.

Skylynn's phone beeped with a message. She quickly looked up with shock clear in her eyes. She let out a soft gasp, at the surprise of being discovered. Skylynn backed away slowly, but Jake reached out to grab her before she could run away from him. He brought her close, and put an arm around her waist.
"I had a feeling it was you?" Jake mumbled.
"You did?" Skylynn said shyly, when her insides were jumping with joy.
He wasted no time in pressing his lips to hers in a passionate kiss. Watching the scene unfold, someone gasped. But the couple was oblivious to everything around them, as they were in a heated make out session. She could barely contain her tears as she ran down the stairs and out of the house.

there are like three or some chapters left to this story, and it's kind of sad, bc i enjoy writing this one. i have already decided the ending, and i just want to tell everyone rn. it will not be what you guys are expecting. AT ALL. but i don't want to expose too much (get it? the chapter is called exposed? no? okay.)
anyways.
