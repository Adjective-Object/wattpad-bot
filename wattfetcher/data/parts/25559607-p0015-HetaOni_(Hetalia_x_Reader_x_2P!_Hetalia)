We all stopped at the attic door on the fourth floor. Japan had the key, so he opened it again.

"Well?" Japan asked.
Germany was trying with all his might to get the AmeriMochi out.
"It's stuck pretty deep.Can you do it, West?" Prussia asked.
(OoH! That's what he said. Lol)
"Huggggnn!! ......Sorry, I can't do it with my bare hands. Maybe if I had some kind of tools." Germany stated.
Japan then began to think of something. "A tool...Well, it's a big house. I'll take a look around."
"Yeah, I would be really thankful if you could find something useful." Germany said.
"Oh, well. I guess we'll have to split up again to look for it." Prussia said.
The AmeriMochi suddenly reacted unpleasantly towards Germany. To the surprise of the burly man. "Ngggh... Wooaaaaargh!!"
"Awesome face." Prussia said, amused.
"Well then I'll be going ahead. I'll come back as soon as I find anything good." Japan said.
"Ah! Can I tag along, Japan?" I asked.
He smiled and nodded. "Sure. Come on, let's go."
I smiled back and walked over to him.
Prussia then spoke up. "I think I'll go, too. Actually I haven't looked around very much. Might as well do some exploration!"
"Thanks." Japan said.
Parted from Germany and Prussia.
