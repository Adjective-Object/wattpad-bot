He stopped the car and I gave him a confused look, I looked around. A large mountain was a bit farther from where we were standing. Large trees surrounded us, I turned around to look at Luke. He placed out many blankets and pillows, he motioned me to come sit next to him. I sat back on the, back of his truck. ~2 hours later~All he wanted to do was talk! But I listened, he told me about his favorite things, he even told me I was one of his favorite things. "I never knew what love would be like, but when I look into your eyes, it all changes. I know what I did was wrong and I ruined your trust, but I want you to forgive me. You mean the world to me, I'd do anything for you. I promise, I'll make up for everything I did wrong. I promise." His voiced cracked slightly and tears filled his eyes. That's what I was waiting for, not a little 'I'm sorry'. I was basically waiting for him to pour his heart out to me. I smiled and my wolf howled in happiness knowing I just accepted Luke as my mate. L U K E . My Alpha. I smirked, I like the sound of that. I pulled him close kissing him lightly. I felt a sudden urge to, just to be in Luke's arms. A un-describable filled my body as Luke connected our lips. His soft lips. I pulled away and looked into his eyes. And at this exact moment, I knew I was in love. I was in love with my Devil Alpha, Luke. Mine. I love the man, I wanted to escape from, when he marked me. But you must forget to forgive.So that's what I'm going to do, forget, and forgive.
