"I hate you" Elina said for the 586258th time, "At least your hands are free" I raised my cuffed hands then continued my istighfaar and tasbeeh like I did in the past hours.
"Why are you so calm ? You're supposed to be afraid or angry because we're here" Elina poked me.
"But I'm not, because I didn't do anything wrong, and as long as I'm right, I'm not afraid of anything" A police man came in and stared at both of us,"Excuse me sir, we have been here for more than 4 hours and you haven't done anything yet and we should probably go home because it's getting dark, plus, I guess that both of us have the right of making one phone call" I said but he ignored "I AM TALKING TO YOU" I shouted at the lazy cop, "Calm down if you do not want any extra charges" He mocked.
"Hey" The cop I punched 4 hours ago came back with the mustachey one, he had some bandages on his nose and a black eye.
"Sir, I believe that you owe me an explanation for dragging me and keeping me cuffed without any reason !"
"Without any reason ? You punched a cop ! And drove without lisence, you have no idea how big this is" The mustachey one said.
"I can drive ! But I'm still working on getting an american lisence since I'm in america and my previous one cannot be used here" I explained.
"Oh, why didn't you say that before ?" He looked surprised, "Oh please ? Really ? Like you gave me a minute to speak, you ran to get this twisted perverted wolf of a cop to get him to a hospital", "Watch your tune young lady", "Hey ! Dont go easy on her ! She broke my nose" The pervert said, "Not my falt your face is so soft" I chuckled.
"I guess we'll have to accause you by assaulting a police man and stealing a car" Im not getting into jail for defending myself and my dignity, and it's not a stolen car ! Not exactly stolen ...
"HE SQUEEZED MY BUTT AND TOUCHED ELINA, OKAY ?!?" And then I said it ... The pervert's eyes got widened along with everybody else in the room and Elina gasped.
"Sh-she's lying I swear" He lied.
"No it's right" Elina rubbed her face.
"Oh you are in a big trouble, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE, DO ONE MORE STUPID MOVE AND YOURE OUT"
"We are so so so sorry for that, be sure that he'll get the punishmet he deserves", "Oh really ? Now you're sorry ? We've been here for 4 hours for nothing because none of you wanted to hear me. I wont accept anything less than kicking him out" I started to get aggressive.
"No, Not for nothing, for the car" I hated this pervert at this moment even more.
"Listen to me, you really don't want Mr.Carter to hear anout this and get angry" Elina threatened.
"I want to call somebody, you won't take my rights too, right ?"
"You have 5 minutes" The mustachey cop gave my my phone.
"I'm not forgiving any of you for forcing me into doing what I'm about to do" I called Damon ...
"WHERE IS MY CAR ? DID YOU CRASH IT  ? ME AND MOM  CALLED 100 TIMES BUT NON OF YOU  ANSWERED WHERE ARE YOU ?" He ripped my eardrums.
"I need your help ?" those 4 words tasted worse than poison, I heard his devilish laugh, "Well, well, well ..."
"Do not overreact because it's the first and last time I ask for a favor from you, plus, your sister is stuck with me in the police station"
"What the hell have you both done, I swear if mom hears y-", I cut him off " Will you help me or not ?", "Okay I will, what do you need ?", "Just come here and tell them that we did not steal this car and that it belongs to you and that Elina is your sister and tell them my story and why I'm here so they can set us free" He chuckled, "I see *pause* but you'll need to do something for me in return" Nothing is worse and getting into jail but being under the control of a jerk, that's a different level "What do you want ?", "I want you to do my math and sience homeworks for 2 months"
