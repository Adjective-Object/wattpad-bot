Austin's P.O.V.
**five days later**
Amanda still hasn't woken up and for the past five days I've been constantly visiting her to she if she has woken up since I have a rented car. I've been writing a song for her so I can sing it to her at the hospital. I am almost finished with the song and I am getting ready for another day of seeing her in a hospital bed. I hate seeing her like that cause it makes me hate myself. I should hate myself but it was an accident.
I wrote down the last line to the song, ripped out the paper from my notebook, grabbed my guitar, and headed out the door. I put my guitar in the backseat of my car, got in, and drove off.
**At the hospital**
I went to Amanda's room to find her still "sleeping". I sighed and just sat next to her and held her hand. Then I started to talk to her, "hey Baby Girl, you know I miss you a lot and I need you to stay with me. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I don't want to loose you" I said trying to hold back my tears from crying.
I wrote you a song and want to sing it to you when everyone is here. I put my heart and soul into it and I hope you love it" I said then I saw everyone walking into the room. I wiped the tears that were in my face off and then I said "hi" to everyone. "I wrote Amanda a song and I want you guys to be here to hear me sing it" I said them. They nodded, I grabbed my guitar and took a deep breath in and out.
Then I strummed my guitar strings.
**Beginning of the song**
You got me up all night in bed thinkingAbout our love, the nights you've been with meAnd how I wished that I could reach you through them
Across the globe, you're far awayBut your heart stays here with me babyIf I could turn back the hands of time, I wouldFreeze the clocks and start all overI would love you all the way just like I shouldEvery minute without you it feels like tortureEvery minute without you it feels like tortureEvery minute without you it feels like tortur-
**Stopped singing**
Everyone was in tears and so was I. My mouth dropped opened and I was speechless. I saw Amanda open up her eyes and I was leaning over her. I started to cry and a tear of mine fell on her face. I tried to wipe it off of her face but she grabbed my wrist and moved it back down while she was shaking her head "no". I nodded back and smiled. "Hey Baby Girl, I'm so glad you woke up. I've missed y-" I said as I got cut off by the doctor.
"Oh welcome back Ms.Quevedo, how are you feeling?" He asked. She gave him a thumbs up and he smiled and nodded. He took out the toobs that were down in her throat and the took off her IV. We all smiled and had tears of joy. Riya came and gave me a hug and told me, "I'm so happy that she's back, please what ever you do don't loose her because she is an amazing person and she will always love and care for you".
"Trust me I don't want to loose her, she's my everything and I love her with all my heart. I will do anything I can to keep her in my arms and call her "MINE". She will always be mine no matter what" I said to her. She gave me a big smile and another hug, then she walked back over to Liam and wrapped her arms around his torso. The doctor told me that he was gonna go check her out and she had to change and luckily I kept a pair of her sweat pants and a T-shirt with socks and uggs for her in my car just in case she woke up when I was there.
