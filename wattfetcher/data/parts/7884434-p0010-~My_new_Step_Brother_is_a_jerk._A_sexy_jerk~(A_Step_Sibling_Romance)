I kissed him back parting my lips and letting his sweet taste dance over my taste buds. I deepened the kiss wrapping my arms around his neck and running my fingers through his black silky hair.
His tongue slipped into my mouth having our dance together for domianance. His eventually won. I let a small moan escape my throat as his hand rubbed the bare skin on my lower back. Caressing the soft skin.
He pulled away and rested his forehead on mine. A half smile made its way to his swollen pink lips. "I was hoping that kiss would suck so I wouldn't have the erge to do it again" He said pecking my lips softly.
"Mmm so was I" I answered truthfully.
"I'm not going to lie, that was the best kiss I have ever had" I small smile came to my face.
"You have kissed plently of girl before Seth. Im sure there had to be Â abunch that topped mine" I said releasing from his warm embrace. He pulled me back wrapping his arms around me.
"Let me just hold you a little longer. I won't be able to do this again" He said sadness in his voice.
"SETH! I WANT MY ICE CREAM!" We heared Lisa yell from downstairs.
Seth groaned and backed away a little. His arms still wrapped around me. "I gotta go. But remember I always get what I want. You'll come begging for more" And with that he captured my lips one more time in a heated kiss and then started walking away.
"HEY I SAID ONE KISS!" I said angrily
"You didn't seem to mind" He winked and with that he dissapeared.
"WAIT I'M COMING!"
