[A/N: Hello Guys! I am very very sorry for the late update. It was my exams week last week so I've been realy busy studying. Sorry for the long wait but here is Chapter 4!] x

_______________________________________________________________________________
Today is the day I'm changing Niall.
It would be quick and easy since I am much stronger than him.
Niall is currently in class and I skipped since I need time for planning Niall's transformation. After about an hour or so of brainstorming, I decided to walk out the Library and find Niall.
As I was walking towards Niall's classroom, I felt a warm body hugging me from the behind. I inhaled deeply and smelled that it was Harry hugging me. I quietly groaned and put a little fake smile on my face.
"Hey Trish." He smirked. I mentally rolled my eyes and replied. "Hey Harry."
"Can I walk you to your next class?" He asked. "Uhm.." I stuttered. Suddenly I heard a voice in my head.
"Trisha don't let Harry interrupt your plans. Remember he betrayed you and cheated on you for so long. Don't let his charm get to you." The voice whispered.
I quickly shook it off and replied to Harry. "Oh, maybe some other time. I'll see you later." I quickly replied with a confuse look on my face.
"If that's what you want, See you Trish."  He said and walked off.
What a liar, not even a single I LOVE YOU or TAKE CARE left his mouth. Why do I even care, I don't love him anymore. I hate him! Ugh focus Trisha! FOCUS!
I ran towards Niall's classroom and saw him sitting there with the School's most popular slut, Stephanie Reynolds, I can't believe she's cheating on Harry. What a fucking slut. I just walked towards them with an obvious fake smile on my face.
"Hey Trisha." Niall smiled widely at me. "Hey Niall!" I grinned happily. Suddenly Stephanie turned around and rolled her 2 fucking eyes on me. WHAT A BITCH. She turned back around and continued flirting with Niall.
I just shooked my head while laughing at this slut infront of me.
"Niall I need you to come with me please?" I begged while using my charm on him.  He quickly nodded and followed me towards a dark hallway in the southwing of our school.
He looked at me with a confused face.
"You're probably wondering why I asked you to come with me in this dark hallway." I smiled.
"Yeah." He replied, nervousness evident in his tone.
"I'm just gonna ask you a simple question." I smirked evilly while lunging towards him and pushing him against the wall.
"What are you doing Trisha?" He gasped. "I am asking you a  question!" I roared.
He immediately shuts his mouth and looked at me teary eyed.
"Do you want your life to be better?" I asked. "Ye-ah." He stuttered nervously.
"Well today is your lucky day my boy." I chuckled. "What are you gonna-" before he could finished, I cut him short by biting his delicate neck.
He screamed in pain while I moaned in delight.
I released my venom and looked at his pale face.
He slids to the ground slowly falling asleep. He'll wake up in an hour or two.
