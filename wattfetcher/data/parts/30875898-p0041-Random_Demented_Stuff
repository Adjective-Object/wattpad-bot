Four velvet walls
A wooden roof and a floor
This young boy can't take it anymore
The slam as it falls
The rumble as it's buried
This young boy is never treated fairly
A cry from his parents
Screams from all his friends
There's a reason this young boy left without making amends
Four velvet walls
A wooden roof and a floor
To this young boy living was just to much of a chore
