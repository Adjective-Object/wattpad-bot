"You are though." Shawn said.
I got up from the floor away from Jack to avoid this conversation.I sat down next to Hayes and gave him a small smile.Everyone else started having their own conversation so Hayes turned to me.
"What's wrong?" He whispered.
I shrugged and looked at my feet whist playing with my thumbs.I felt Hayes's arm wrap around my shoulder.
"Tell me." he whispered agian.
I sighed and looked up to meet his eyes.I grabbed his wrist and pulled him out into the hallway.
"I don't know if Jack and I are-you know.Because what if we both think we are and don't tell each other then one of us does something really stupid and the other gets hurt.What is your fans start hating on me and start rumors or some dumb shit.I don't know I just don't want anything bad to happen." I sighed.
"None of that will happen.But if it does,just remember to stay strong.Also,talk to Jack if you're confused and try to work something out." Hayes said.
"Thanks Hayes." I said,pulling him into a hug.
"No problem."
