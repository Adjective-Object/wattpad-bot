Before I get started into my story, I will introduce myself first. Well my name is Ariana Miller and I am 16 years old and live in Melbourne, Australia. I am not your typically girl, I am a tomboy, I love hanging out with the guys and playing sports. But I sometimes love to get dress up and put some effort into what I am wearing.
At school I am not the most popular but I pretty popular if you know what I mean. My have many friend s that are guys but my ultimate best friend is Cassandra, we have been friends since kindergarten and have stuck by each others side since.
My best friend has a boyfriend Nathan, not gonna lie he is possibly one of the hottest guys I have ever seen, I sometimes get jealous when I see them together and I'm not sure why. Nathan and I have been best friends since year 7 and I was the one who introduced them.
Your probably wondering what I look like well, I am not the tallest person I am only 5'3, I have a slim figure that I work really hard to keep, I am confident with my body though and very tanned. I have long brown hair just below my ribs. I have brown eyes that everyone seems to love except me, I really don't find anything special about them. People always tell me that I am gorgeous but I don't think I am, to me I just look average.
My personality is very outgoing if you know me but if you don't know me then I am very shy. I am not afraid to speak my mind and have very strong opinions. If anything were to happen t my friends I would be devastated and do what ever I could o help them. I am not a bitch to people unless there a bitch to me then I am one of the biggest bitches ever.
There are things about me that even Cassandra doesn't know like; I love to sing, I don't know if I am any good though, I love to write songs and dance.
Well I think that is enough about me, lets get started with the story.
