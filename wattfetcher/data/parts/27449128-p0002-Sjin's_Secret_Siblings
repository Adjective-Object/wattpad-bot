I turn around and start running faster than I have before. The footsteps become faster and faster, I get into a thick part of the forest, the person closer than before, but it sounds like there is at least two people behind me. I get distracted by my thoughts, and trip over a tree root. The people come into view, and I realize the footsteps didn't come from people, they came from a single wolf.
I try to get up, but the wolf snarls and jumps at me with an open mouth, showing its teeth. I kick it in the head, the wolf howls in pain, and I use the time to get up and start running again. I hear its paws hit the ground faster than before as it runs after me. I feel its claws hit my back, and I fall to the ground as the wolf sinks his teeth into my left arm. I let out a loud scream as my arm is engulfed in the worst pain I have ever felt. The pain is spreading through my body, I look around to see the wolf has left, then I look at my arm. The sleeve of my coat is ripped off, my arm has a very deep bite, my entire left arm is covered on blood. The amount of blood is leaving a tiny crimson colored puddle. A new wave of pain goes through my body and I'm paralyzed, that is replaced with a burning sensation that is making my muscles sore. I'm taken back by the new sensation of pain and let out another scream, then I black out.
