Karam came back with a paper in his hand, he didn't seem very happy, he threw it in front of Simon, "What does this say?" Karam pointed at the title of the news paper, "I don't know" Simon said, "READ IT" Karam shouted, "I CAN'T" Simon said, "What's wrong, I'll read it for you" I said calmly, "Back off" Karam said then caught the hem of Simon's shirt, Simon giggled, "What are you doing? Is this a new sort of games?" Simon chuckled, hetc thought Karam was kidding, but I was sure he wasn't, "I SAID READ THIS DAMN SENTENCE" Karam shouted again, "Calm down dude, I don't read Arabic ! I'M AMERICAN" Simon said.
"I KNEW IT, GET OUT" Karam said, "What?" My eyes widened, "You lied, you lied to me, HE'S NOT MUSLIM, HE CAN'T READ ARABIC, HOW CAN HE READ QUR'AAN THEN? HOW CAN HER PRAY WITHOUT READING QUR'AAN? I'BE NEVER SEEN HIM PRAY EVEN ONCE ! HOW CAN HE BE MUSLIM THEN? You fooled me" Karam had his face red as a tomato, "So what ! FINE! HE'S NOT MUSLIM, I LIED" I said, "Get out Simon, NOW" Karam shouted, "SO YOU'RE KICKING HIM OUT BECAUSE HE'S CHRISTIAN? NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE RACIST" I shouted back, "NO, I let him stay because I thought he was Muslim, Muslims help each others out of brotherhood, because they all are brothers and sisters. Then why would a Christian guy protect a beautiful Muslim girl? He either likes her or wants to use her. And you *points at Simon* If killing wasn't haraam I would've killed you, I've seen the security tapes, I've seen everything, from the moment you took her at night untill the kiss, NOW GET OUT BEFORE I KILL YOU" Karam yelled, Simon stood in his place with something in his eyes, it wasn't fear or hate, it was something I couldn't figure out until days after what happened ... it was fear of losing me after finally having me. "I SAID GET OUT" Karam punched Simon's face, his punch wasn't soft, Karam has a muscular body. "AND YOU *POINTS AT ME* YOUR PUNISHMENT STARTS FROM THIS SECOND" Karam slapped me hard.
