A servant came up to me. I let go of Fili then stood up. I looked at the elf. He motioned me to follow him. He led me to a balcony with a beautiful view. There was two elves, a wizard in white, and Gandalf. I bowed slightly then rose. "Hello Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman the White." I greeted them.
"Do you know who you are? Do you know our future?" Saruman asked.
"Yes. I am Elrond's half sister. I do know your future." I answered.
"Your father was a ring bearer. He had the ring, NÃªnalavan. The ring is the ring of power for water and animals. You are his only child. You must become it's new bearer." Galadriel said.
"There is also something about your future children. They will be twins. Their father will be a dwarf. Your daughter will be more like an elf. She will be immortal but grow like a dwarf until she in 23 in human years. Her beauty will shine. Your son will be more like a dwarf in every way but will also be immortal like an elf. He will have his father's bearings and your eyes. They will be important to our future." Elrond informed me.
"Then I will tell my daughter all I know about the future." I decided.
"Your new ring will help you turn into a blue dragon which will breathe frost. Azog is hunting you down to gain that power for Valar knows what." Gandalf said.
You already showed them the morgul blade. I thought to Gandalf.
Yes. Gandalf nodded.
Sauron has returned. I know this. I will meet up with you at the cliff. I must stay here for a bit.
Very well.
"I must leave now." Gandalf announced.
"By whose order?" Saruman questioned him.
"Mine. I need him to do something for me. It is none of your business." I lied.
"This meeting is over. Sister, I will see you at dinner." Elrond smiled.
I walked to my room. I saw my weapons and Fili's coat on my bed. I put them on a chair and got changed for dinner. Saruman left. I walked to the dining hall. I ate dinner and met Elrond's children. I went to my room and fell asleep wearing my ring of power.
Michelle's Dream/Vision....
I was a blue dragon. I smelled fire in the distance as I flew to help the company at the first time Thorin nearly dies after dealing with the goblins. I had the company in my sight. Gandalf recognized me. I saw Azog's warg biting  Thorin. I flew at them then quickly turned into myself. I landed on my feet. I drew out my sword. The white warg dropped Thorin. I knew that Thorin saw me.
The white warg ran at me. I dodged the warg and cut it's ear off. An orc went to chop off Thorin's head. Bilbo killed the orc before Thorin blacked out.

Hi. What do you think will happen after the vision comes true? Will Thorin forgive Michelle for not telling him what she was or will he hurt her heart mentally again? Who will Michelle choose to save? Will she make the choice or will the choice be made for her? I can't wait to write about it. Don't forget to vote and comment. -Faith-
