I'm just kind of floating again. Oh well. As long as I make it through today I should be good. I'm kind of bored honestly. I don't have anyone to talk to. I've been writing in this "journal"  and coloring. That's about it. I keep thinking about my dreams. Just. Everyone dying with me watching. I know it's not real but I feel it. I feel everything. It's odd. I don't need this right now honestly. I felt like I was getting better but these dreams are getting in the way. I'm sure they'll stop. My higher power seems to think they'll help me in the long run. I mean maybe it's right. They might. Doesn't mean I like it though.
I've stopped harming myself. That's good. I don't feel a need to and I don't want to.
I don't really question eating anymore. I have to. Why avoid it?I'm eating, I don't vomit, I can keep my pills down.
Speaking of pills. God they're annoying. But I have to take them. If I don't I feel worse. So Jordan wins, he was right... again.They do help.
Maybe they're the jumpstart to getting better.
I'll keep with it. But yeah. That's about it.
