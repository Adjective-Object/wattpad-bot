~~~"...how do you guys want to live your lives after this?" ~~~


The girl's words flashed back to him. Of all those years they've lived their immortal lives, they've never been asked about what they have wanted before.


Come to think of it, it's been such a long time in their dark lives that he ever felt some sort of...ray of hope. Some sort of....warmth.... Like sunshine...


He started pacing around the room, reflecting on the words of the girl.


She befriended him, with all sincerity.


He thought it'd be impossible for her to ever even try looking at him in the face for leading her to the mansion. But she gave him a second chance. His mind sort of turned into mush after that, making him set the girl free to go meet the First Players, against Luciano's wishes. Once the auburn haired Italian finds out, he'll probably lose his mind with rage. But that's Luciano. He's the one who really wanted to take over the lives of those First Players. He was the one who came up with this whole mansion plan. Not everything was thought through, though.


They may have talked about plans on getting rid of the 1Ps and having a new and better life...but...they really haven't thought of the fact that they may or may not be able to take on that troublesome burden of running a nation.


Okay, maybe Luciano has? But not them.


No. If it were him, he wouldn't want all those busy days of paperwork and dirtywork.


If he were to choose freely...he would...he would....


What would he do....?


~~~"Why don't you open a pastry shop or something?" ~~~


(Name)'s suggestion echoes in his mind.


He never really considered that before. The mere thought of him having his own pastry shop--something so normal and so impossible, were all like a dream.


Thinking about it right now, it is like a dream.


A very sweet dream.
