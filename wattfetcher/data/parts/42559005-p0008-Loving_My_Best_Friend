"bri.....if you dont want me to do anything i won't, but promise dont EVER go near him again" he says.
i nodd and let a tear slip.
"sabrina i will never let anybody hurt you again, if anybody hurts you they wont live another second!" he says
he kisses my forehead. "j-jack can you stay with me p-please" i say with hopeful eyes.
"anything for you" he says smiling. im so glad he is my best friend.
"im gonna go brush my teeth and get ready for bed" i say.
he smiles and nods.
*after im done*
i change bra and underwear in the bathroom and walk out like that.
dont worry , this is the way me and jack are, we are just friends. (not for long....)
i put in spandex and a muscle shirt, "jacky can i wear your hoodie?" i ask
"yeah here!" he says taking it off and tossing it to me. he was shirtless , i have to admit....he has a nice body.
i put the hoodie on and it fits me huge. i laugh and so does he.
i lay in bed and turn off the lamp. "goodnight jacky"
i feel him move and then he pulls me close, and wraps his arm around. we are in a spooning position.
he kisses my forehead "goodnighy bri".
then....i slowly drifted off to sleep feeling safe and secure.
(Jacks Pov)
i think im falling for my best friend..........
