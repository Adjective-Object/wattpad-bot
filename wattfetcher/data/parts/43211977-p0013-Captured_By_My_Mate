Emily POV
I grab my brother's car keys and was planning to go to Jake for I had miss him too. His crazy personality. Then asks "where the fuck you are going? You didn't even answer my question" I reply "I don't fucking need to!" I follow the long road as I was reignited with Jake and I hug him I hear a low growl and see Ethan on the side of me.
Why does he have to be a dick!
