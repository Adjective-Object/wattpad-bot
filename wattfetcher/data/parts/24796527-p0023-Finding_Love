"Thank you." I said softly like there was a baby in the room.
"Anything for you." He said and kissed my cheek "Get some rest sweetheart, goodnight."
"Stay with me tonight? Please." My voice cracked and I became afraid of the possible nightmares I could have and so he did. He took his shirt off and changed into sweats and the sweet guy he was also brought me back a pair of my shorts and a tank top. Gosh this boy is amazing. I stood up and changed not caring he was there. I'd get out of my bathing suit tomorrow but right now I just wanted to lay down and sleep. Charlie had already gotten on the couch and laid down under the blanket. I got under soon after and faced him, and he put his arm around me carefully and possessively.
"Goodnight sweetheart." He smiled and looked into my eyes before he read me like a book. I wanted him to kiss me and he did exactly that, he kissed me gently before pulling away and pulled my body closer to his, if that was even possible.
"Goodnight." I whispered and smiled back as we both closed our eyes.
