Italy smiled.  "That's right, it's a burden that we nations carry, so it's only natural~"




"And yet you're going to help us?" America asked.



Italy nodded.  "I've thought about it. What if we escape and go home and I have a fight with...America for example. A fight so big that we can never make amends."



"We definitely can't say that would never happen." the American said, sighing.



"Yeah. So, if it came to that, suppose you got caught in a situation like this we're in again?"



"Uh-huh."



"In that case, I think I would forget all about our fight and do my best to help you. Like I'm doing right now."


America couldn't think of anything to say. It was almost unbelievable.



"If I can do something about it, I will help. Because we're all fellow nations. We fight each other, we help each other, and together we can do what we wouldn't be able to do if we were alone.

Now I understand this. If I helped you and you asked me, 'But weren't we fighting?' I'd remember. But then, it wouldn't matter anymore.
If we got out and fight again...if something like this happens again, I'll help you. It would be hard to do that as Italy, but as Feliciano, I'd would definitely help you..." Italy said with all sincerity.


America couldn't help but chuckle.  "...You're amazing."



"What about you, America?" Italy asked.



"What?"



"Do you hate me or England? I don't hate you. That's why I've been working so hard to help you. Are you any different?"
