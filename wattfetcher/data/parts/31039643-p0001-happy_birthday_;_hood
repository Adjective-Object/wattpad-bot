"happy birthday, katy!"
"i'm sorry you couldn't go home from the hospital this year. maybe next year?" her mother was always a sincere woman.
"i've got you this." the boy thrusts a balloon towards the girl.
"a balloon?"
"a balloon."
each year she spent her birthday at the hospital, each year the little boy had given her a balloon. she never understood why he had always given her a balloon, until the day she outlived the boy.
"each year i've given you air so your lungs could breath. each year i've been losing and you've been gaining air. hopefully, you will one day be able to roam the streets like i once did."
