This was another week were she had gotten no sleep. Another day she had to lie to her best friend. Another day she doesn't eat. It was just another day of seeing him. It's just an normal day of being the unwanted girl. Another day with fake friends and being accused of liking a random boy.
One kiss. Turned in two.
Lightning flashing through the window as it highlighted the room. making shadows of themselves. Thunder crashing making her flinch and he rubbed her back the make sure everything was okay, that he was right there.
The rain pounding against the roof as it made the thunder sound more fierce.
The third kiss was sweet, like honey. she was getting more addicted by every kiss that has passed. The darkness made it even better so he wouldn't see her being scared of the storm. The time passed, standing in the same room for hours as the power had be turned off an hour ago.
Another kiss, he was liking this. She was enjoying this also. She like how his lips were soft. He liked the feeling he got when he kissed her. She liked the feeling also. He liked the sounds of the weather in the background how that and their heartbeats were all he could her. Her chest felt tight, as every kiss made her feel more confident about herself.
Soft lips, get her addicted. Not anybody's lips, it was only his that made her feel this way. Like a train, it can't automatically stop. It takes a while to finally come to a stop.
He smiled between kisses. He is loving the moment. They pulled away. She flinched when lightening highlighted the room again. The light was enough for him to see tears streaming down her face.
He kissed her nose. He thought it was cute. The tears we still running out of her eyes.
"It's okay, I'm right here." he whispered in her ear as he kissed her one more time before their cuddle session in his bed.
