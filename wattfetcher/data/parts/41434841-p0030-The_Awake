Hm.I mean I know I said I didn't want you back but I do. We've covered this. I love you. I love you so damn much. But I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you have to remember me as I was. Kind of rude and hurting you. I know what happened. I can get over it I'm sure. Just. Please know that wasn't the reason I am doing this. That you aren't the reason I'm doing this. You will be so successful in your life. Please. Don't give up. Don't do what I am doing. Don't waste your life. Yes, you'll make mistakes and slip up. But it's part of living. You will trip but you just need to get up and dust yourself off and keep going. Don't forget to rest. You need it. Remember to take your medication. Be careful who you trust. Take care of yourself. Be safe. Remember that I love you. I will never stop loving you. I don't want you at my funeral, okay?You don't need to see me like that. That'll hurt you.
You are smart. You are loved. And you are so important.
What happened in the past is the past. You can move on from that and grow. Everyone starts somewhere. If life was easy it would get boring.
Keep your head held high. Look up at the stars. Swing until your legs give out. Never give up.
