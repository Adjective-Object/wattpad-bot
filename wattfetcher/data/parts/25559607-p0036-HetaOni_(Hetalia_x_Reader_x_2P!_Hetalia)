China nodded. "That's right, aru. So all three of us went to check out the upper floors. When we were in the middle of inspecting a room, we heard gunshots. We assumed it was America's so we decided to go back down to meet up with France and check out the situation.
When we finished looking and came down to the second floor, France didn't return. _____ wanted to check out the fireplace room again..in hopes that you guys might be back there, so I went inside the room with her. No one was in the room, but I found Japan's burnt clothes in the fireplace, and I wondered what had happened."
"We came back to the first floor and found Russia and Canada fighting that Thing. That bastard disappeared the first chance he got." England said.
Japan looked up. "Really? Um, I vaguely noticed it when I was fighting it, but that strange creature..."
"It resembles a friend of America's, doesn't it?" Germany stated.
China stood up. "That's right! I noticed it the moment I saw it! That's definitely it! Um... its name was..."
Germany was trying to remember, as well. "To... Tommy? Wasn't it?"
England agreed. "Yeah, that was definitely its name. They look identical. Don't you think this was America's doing?
He's the one who heard the rumour about this place and asked us to come here,after all..."
"I see!! So this is just a prank of America's that got too far! Well, in that case, there's nothing else to say! Let's just look for America!" Italy said in a relieved tone.
Then I noticed Canada suddenly looked like he wanted to say something. When our eyes met, I smiled at him and motioned him to say something if he had something to say. He smiled back and took a deep breath.
"...You're mistaken." He said in a voice a bit louder than usual.
England looked confused. "Huh?"
Everyone else then their attention to Canada.
I was also about to listen to him, when I felt my vision start to blur.
