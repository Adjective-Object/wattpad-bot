And finally, 5. The. Fucking. Ice Cream truck.
I love ice cream. That stuff is the shit. However, the ice cream trucks that circulate my neighborhood are too annoying for words. I'm serious. Same fucking jingle. Every fucking day.
We had this one cool ice cream truck a few years back that would change jingles from time to time in order to mix things up,
But not the truck that runs our block now. Nope. Same fucking jingle. Every. Fucking. Day.
It's like trying to get the It's A Small World song out of your head. It's tattoed into your brain from the first listen. And sure, you might not think of it for a while, but it never actually leaves. And once something reminds you of it, you're back to having it play in your head 24/7.
