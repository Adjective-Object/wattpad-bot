Pale foundation for my pale ass complexion, eyeliner, mascara and a lip balm nearly completed the look, I spotted my favourite boots out of the corner of my eye and jumped towards them. Just as I was lacing them up, I heard the front door click open and Pete's loud and cheerful voice booming through the walls."Yo, how are we, Wentz's?"
"Hi Pete!" I heard my dad reply, also happily.
I sighed sadly and shouted down, "I'll just be a second!" Grabbing my phone and my bag, I headed down to be greeted by Meagan almost knocking me over with a hug.
"SOPH! I missed you so much!" Her sweet voice said. Meagan's perfect. She's so beautiful, so lovely to be around and everyone loves her.
"Calm down Meagan, you saw her last week! Now let me squish my favourite sister." Pete laughed as Meagan sulkily dropped the hug and let Pete replace her. I slightly leant into his shoulder. Pete hugs were my favourite.
"I'm your only sister you dick." I whispered into his ear, just because our parents didn't like us using words like that.
"You'd be my favourite even if everyone in the world was my sister." This was such a Pete thing to say and it made me smile.
"Are we going then? Saint's asleep in the car so we can't be in here too long." Saint is Pete's youngest son and he is such an angel, I love him to death.
"Bye guys." Our dad apparently just decided for us that we were leaving, fair enough.
