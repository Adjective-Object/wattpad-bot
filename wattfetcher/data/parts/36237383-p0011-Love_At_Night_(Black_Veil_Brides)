I washed off my makeup and ruined dress and got dressed into a short red dress. The party had ended and the sun was rising. I heard a slight knock on my door. I opened it a crack to see Ashley. I motioned him to come in. He looked around my room.
"Where did you run off to last night?" He asked me. I closed the door and walked up to him.
"It doesnt matter." I said kissing him lightly. He smirked.
"I will kill him... you understand that." Ashley said to me. I dropped my head and nodded in agreement. He felt the material of my dress and left the room. I stared at the floor realizing what my life was going to be.
My father had called me down for dinner as soon as the sun had set. I wasted no time and entered the dining room. My father sat at the other end of the table and motioned me to take a seat. I slid the chair back and sat down.
"Your wondering why your here. I just wanted to see if your happy with your new fianc√®." My father said sipping his wine.
"Ive never been happier." I fake a smile. He nodded slowly and ordered me to go. I scoffed and left quickly. Jess was sitting on the steps reading. She glanced up to see me.
"Hey, Ashley just left you know." She said.
"Thanks for telling me." I said. She could tell something was wrong.
"Bitch spill." Jess said tapping the stair. I rolled my eyes and took a seat next to her. I told her about the night i met Ashley, how i saved Andy. The tension between me and Andy and Ashley threatning to kill him. Then i told her about last night. How i went to Andys and he told me to leave. She listened through it all with open ears. She took an imaginary deep breath.
"Whoa..." She said. I laughed by her choice of word.
"So thats it? Your just going to forget about him?" She asked me. I looked down.
"It would seem so. I dont have a choice and he made it clear." I said. She nodded slighly before Ashley returned. He smiled and approached me. He grabbed my hand and helped me up.
"You and I are going somewhere." He smirked.
"Where we going?" I asked. He blinked and smiled.
"You'll see."
