Kylie's POV:
Kono, Chin, Colin and I were driving to where Danny and Uncle Steve were. When we got there I told Colin to stay in the car because I didn't want to get him caught in the line of fire. He fought with me about it but when I threatened to handcuff him to the car he shut right up. Kono, Chin and I approached slowly and when we got to the top of the cliffs we split up and I saw Danny and Uncle Steve standing with guns drawn. I hid behind a bush and positioned my gun so that I would get a clear shot of Core if he decided to shoot.
"Christian Core please put down the gun" Uncle Steve said.
"You see I can't do that, Thanatos needs his final sacrifice" Core said. This guy was nuts."Thanatos demands a Spartan as a sacrifice."
"Look Christian, there is no Thanatos just put the gun down" Danny said. Core looked angry and then he shot Danny in the shoulder and then advanced on Uncle Steve. Before he could shoot Uncle Steve I jumped out of the bush.
"Christian Core put your gun down pr we will shoot" I yelled.
"I mustn't anger Thanatos" Core said. You have got to be kidding me, just as he pulled the trigger at Uncle Steve I pulled mine and shot Core. Core fell and I ran up to Uncle Steve. Kono helped Danny and Chin cuffed Core, who was bleeding pretty badly from his shoulder.
"Nice shot" Uncle Steve said hugging me.
"Thanks. I'm just glad you're okay" I said.
"Me too. How did you know that I was the next target?"
"Oh that was Colin. He was the one who gave me the hint. The other victims all had jobs that were important in ancient Greece. I figured who would fit as a Spartan better than a Navy- Seal which is you" I said.
"Wait, Colin helped you figure out I was the target. Where is he?" Uncle Steve asked.
"Handcuffed to the side of Chin's car" I said smirking. Uncle Steve smiled and hugged me and we walked back to the car.
***********************************************************************************************
We were all sitting around a table at a restaurant, laughing. It felt good. Danny was okay, the bullet didn't go deep but Danny's arm would be sore for a while.
"So I think we have a new nickname for you Steve" Chin said.
"Psychotic Spartan" I said and took a sip of my soda.
"I like that one" Danny said.
"I don't know I'm torn between all of them. Super Seal, Ninja, Psychotic Spartan, and Neanderthal Animal" I said.
"Neanderthal Animal is my favorite" Danny said.
"I don't know I like being a Super Seal" Uncle Steve said. Everyone laughed and then I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and saw Colin. I stood up and he motioned me to follow him onto the beach.
"Hey what's up?" I said.
"I... uh... have some good and bad news" he told me looking down at the sand.
"What is it?" I asked trying to make eye contact with him.
"The good news is.. um.. I've been invited to go pro in surfing" he told me finally looking me in the eyes.
"That's great news" I said hugging him.
"Yeah, it is but that means I will be away from the girl I have a crush on for six months a year" he told me. He has a crush on a girl and he didn't tell me. How could he not tell me?
