Today was somewhat alright. I woke up sick and my throat hurt a lot. I was alright in the morning but like the around 9 it hurt to talk, so I carried my notebook around and used it to communicate with others. That was a bit fun, but then I got a fever at the end of the school day.  I also heard something that made me feel upset. I always put on a brave face,  but now I feel like vulnerable to my emotions if that even makes sense. I also read something that makes me feel like a friend doesn't even like me or our other friends. I found this picture online and that is how I feel. It sucks not being able to talk. You can't say what you want say because if you write it down you can't express emotions well.
