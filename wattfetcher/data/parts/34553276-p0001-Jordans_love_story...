Me and my best friend Hannah were walking home from A after school dance. The dance was amazing but it was usual.
Some guys asked for hannah and I for our number. There all fat pigs that disgust me in so many
ways.  And of corse we turned them down. Not even a gorilla would date them.
It was a cold Friday night as we walked. And I felt really strange. Like someone was watching us.
Hannah was staying at my house for the weekend and we planned on watching Twilight movies and eating popcorn.
I know boring but she just got out of a bad break up so I was doing what she wanted to do...
Hey... hannah was the type of girl that liked to goof off and have fun. She's also like a very childish teenager. She had always goofed of in everything we did. She has always loved the color pinkish orange. Like a sunset.
I however loved the color  fiery red. Hannah always thought of me as a leader.  In every activity we would do I was always to lead. Even in foot ball, I was qurterback, and I would give the plays out and instruct them. We got first place for 5 years. But I just think of me as a let down. I'm never strong anouph.
There's something about me though, I had a bad attitude. But I loved winning.! Winning is every thing to me. I'm not the sweet ballerina type of girl. I'm a fighter. And I hate giving up!
As we were walking my phone started to ring. I looked down at the caller ID. It's just mom.
" Hey honey, I have to work late, just eat leftovers. Ok? Also I won't be home intill 2 weeks.
"Ok mom, I'll be home soon with hannah. Have fun at work, byeee."
"Bye honey have fun on the first weeks of summer" She answered then hung up.
"Looks like we're having leftovers for dinner. " I told hannah.
"Fine with me. HEYY do you want to go some where cool? "I asked. Great... when she says cool, we always get in trouble.
"Ok hannah lead the way..." I said, knowing it was going to end badly.
As we walked I couldn't help but feel, un safe.
As we kept walking I relized where we were going.
"Hannah why are we walking to an abandoned contruction site?"
"Jordan, it's an awesome place. It's really cool at night" She said.
All of the sudden a purple flame bullet shot past both of us. I turned around and saw about 15 wierd looking robots shooting purple flame bullets at us. My instincts intently kicked in.
My first priority was to get hannah to safty. But where?!
"HIDE NOW!" I yelled at hannah. She froze on the spot. Wow hannah really?
I quickly tackled her and led her to a concrete cylinder. She went in first and I was second.
" WHAT WERE U THINKING?  WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED!" I wisper/ yelled.
She didn't have time to answer when we heard yelling and fighting outside of the cylinder.
I peeked out just in time to see 4 giant turtles fighting the robots that attacked us. What in the world?
I watched there every move. I could tell the blue one was the leader because he would yell commands while fighting. He  would also help them when they couldn't take the robots.
But that one wasn't the one that caught my attention the most. The one that caught my attention was the red masked turtle. There was just something about him that I liked... hmmm strange...
