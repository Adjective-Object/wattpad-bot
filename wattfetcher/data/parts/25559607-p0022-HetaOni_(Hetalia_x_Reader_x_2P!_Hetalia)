"Th-!!
L-
Look, this isn't funny.I'm just... hearing things, right?
There's no one here! No one!!Why aren't those three waking up!?
Can't they hear anything!?"
~Back to Reader-chan's PoV!~
My eyes suddenly fluttered open as I felt a change in temperature and heard Prussia saying something aloud.
"Hah! That's it! I'll use Japan's strategy and pretend I'm not here! If I turn off my aura, I won't be found!" I hear him say.
What's going on...?
AH! It's this scene... I suddenly remember. Dangit. Why didn't I remember this sooner?
I was about to get up from the bed when...I realised that...
I was paralysed.
Shit. What's this?! I can't move...Nor can I talk?!
"...I guess I can't do it. Right, I have no choice then..." Prussia says.
From the corner of my eye, I see him walk over to the door.
"Forgive me.It's tough being alone." He said.
I am trying with all my might to get my body to move... Why can't I move, damnit?!!
"...SHIT! No!I won't die yet!!" Prussia yells.
As soon as he went out of the room, I was able to move. I grabbed my bag, hurriedly put on my shoes and tried to open the door...
*clankclank*
"What?!" I said out loud. Why won't the door open?!
Suddenly, I hear a blade cutting through something...and something collapsing.
God... I can't remember what happens here...
I kept on frantically trying to open the damn door.
Then I heard a *click*
I opened the door and shouted, "Prussia?! Are you oka--...."
No one.
There was no one there out the door.
That is, until I went out and turned to my right.
What I saw made my face grow pale.
