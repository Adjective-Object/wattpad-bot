It's like 8:09 and i had just gone onto youtube to find one of my favorite songs i listen to but i forgot the name and the you tuber,so i looked up one of the videos she did but groaned when i didn't find her video.so i typed in bloopers.then i found the correct video and clicked on it only to afterwards click on the person who posted the video.
finally i then listen to my favorite song.i shake my head irritated it took so long then just calmly listened to the song as it said all my feelings
i kept trapped inside me but wouldn't dare let anyone see..i hummed along to the song fed up with the world all together.unconsciously i started singing to the song.,"and ran out into the night!! yeah~"i started drumming on the computer.as the song finished i giggled as i said
,"i need more practice on that one." i sighed as i crossed my arms and stared at the ceiling in the dark room i still trapped myself in.
have you ever wanted someone to hug you out of no where so you could just go weak and let it all out?so you can cry your eyes out?so you could feel like everything was going to be fine?but no one will ever take that hint?so you never feel that feeling you long for?so you hug your pillows at night and silently cry yourself to sleep.
and even when you get hugs they never last?...
never mind ill shut up....
