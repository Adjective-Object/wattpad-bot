There's a saying power drives a man insane.
May I ask who gave the man his license.
For it is he who is to blame.
The farmer's power and the king's power
Those two things are not the same.
See the farmer only eats what he grows,
What he owns.
If the food won't harvest
He'd eat the thoughts that he cooked in his head.
"One day I too will eat, one day I will eat meat".
Those are the words he said.
POWER!
The king at a young age lived luxuries,
the bling on his head.
He never slept on the ground
never slept with the rats.
NAH!
The King's word is word and your words just sentences,
Keep talking in such a way and you might get sentenced.
"OF WITH HIS HEAD!"
No matter how much power a man has he can never move the sky.
Both the farmer and king know this.
Men, Animal, Tree, they all rot in the same place when dead.
Almighty,
POWER!
