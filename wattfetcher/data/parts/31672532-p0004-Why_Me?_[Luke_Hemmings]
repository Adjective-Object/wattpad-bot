I have arrived! Oh wait it's an airport, so no one cares. Either way we made it alive with dads terrible driving and went through the gate to wait for them to call our flight. I've been on a plane before but only to go to California or New York, not Australia. I find a seat next to an outlet to charge my phone. There isn't too many people but we didn't have to wait long either. They called our flight and we headed to the desk to take our ticket and walked down the hall towards the plane. The Darth Vader song started playing in my head as I walked down the corridor. "Hey mom? How long is the flight?" I ask. "About 21 hours. But I'm sure it won't feel that long." She answers. 21 HOURS!? Numerous situations start running through my head. I walk through the door and see the aisles upon aisles of seats. We have first class since dads work is paying for it. Fancy!"Please find you seats we will be leaving soon. Thank you and have a great flight!" A perky blonde says to the left. I was startled at first but calmed down pretty quick. I found my seat and sat at the window seat. Maybe I'll pull out my phone while we are in the air and take a picture! Maybe I'll put it on Tumblr? Instagram? Why not! We take off and are in the air smooth sailing across the sky. I ask for some snacks from mom and she hands me a granola bar with a water. I inhale the bar and sip my water and look out the window to se the sun rising. It's so beautiful! I take out my phone and take a picture but it looks dark. I try again and edit it while I took it. It looked great! I'm glad I have that scholarship to-CRAP MY SCHOLARSHIP! I won't be going to college at California now! Ugh everything is ruined! I tried to forget about everything and plug in my earbuds and listen to A Day To Remember as I try to fall asleep.
