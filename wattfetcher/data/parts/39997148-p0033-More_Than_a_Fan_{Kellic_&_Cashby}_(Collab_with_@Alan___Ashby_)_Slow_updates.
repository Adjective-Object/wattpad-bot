Vic's POV


"So what do you all need at the store?" I asked Jaime.
"Alcohol, food so get shit like hot dogs, marshmallows stuff that you would eat at a camp fire and cups."
"Do you have money to give me, I can't afford all this myself."
"Of course we have money." He said rolling his eyes.
"Then give it to me so Kellin and I can leave."
Jaime glared at me and pulled out a wad of cash from his wallet and handed it to me, "Oh and there's enough in there for you and Kellin to have a romantic lunch too." He said winking.
"Whatever." I muttered, "Kellin lets  go!"
"I'm right here." He said from the couch.
"Right, right. Let's go."
"Okay, the cab is outside waiting for us."
"A cab?"
"Well I figured we wouldn't want to carry all that stuff back." He said shrugging.
I smiled, "Nice thinking."
"I know." He said grinning, "So where are we going first?" He asked as I opened the door.
"The grocery store." I told him and we made our way to the cab.
"Sounds good to me."
"Good." I opened the cab door and motioned to him, "After you."
"Thank you." He said blushing a little as he climbed in. As pervy as it sounded I couldn't help but to look at his ass. I got in after him and shut the door and told the driver where to take us.
"So how'd you sleep?" Kellin asked making conversation.
I shrugged, "Fine what about you?"
"Pretty good." He said.
"That's good." I said, "So why do you like math so much?"
"I was good at it and I always thought it was kind of interesting."
"Really why? Math is so boring."
"I like it, I don't know. Its fun to me."
"Really? Well whatever float you boat then."
He nodded, "What did you do well in? Like what did you like?"
"I was really into graphic design, I was even going to college for it when the band finally made it big and I dropped out." I told him.
"Oh that's cool."
I nodded, "Yeah I actually help a lot when it comes to designing the merch and everything."
"I bet."
"So you're in college right?" I asked.
"Yeah I am."
"What are you going for?"
"Buisiness."
"Oh that's cool."
"Yeah I think it's a lot of fun, that's why I like working the merch table." He said looking down at his hands.
"Well that's good."
