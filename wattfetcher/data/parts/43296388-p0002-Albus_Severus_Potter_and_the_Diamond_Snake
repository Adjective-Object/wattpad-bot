Al pointed his wand at the first, and said, "Petrificus Totalus!" The first fell down in a full body bind, and then Al turned to the other and pointed his wand at him.
Al took his cloak off all of the way, and said, "Stupefy!" The other fell down beside the first, and Al turned to Scorpius. "If they bother you again tell me. I'm fine with getting in trouble." Al said.
"But how'd you know those spells?" Scorpius asked. "My dad knows that there are still some Death Eaters left, and he made sure to teach us some spells, but we couldn't use them until... Well, you know." Al explained.
"I think we should leave them." Al said when Scorpius didn't say anything. "Don't do that, I don't think we should leave them on the train. At least unbind him. He can get his friend." Scorpius said.
This caught Al by surprise. "You really aren't like your dad. Relashio." Al said. "Your not like yours." Scorpius said. "Are you going to come back to our compartment or..." Al trailed off.
"Yeah, come on Bella." Scorpius said. They went back to their compartment, but before they went in, Scorpius stopped Al. "Can I... Can I tell you something?" Scorpius asked.
"You can trust me. I promise if you don't want me to tell anyone, I won't tell anyone." Al said. "This is my twin, Bellatrix Narcissa Malfoy. Please don't tell them." Scorpius said.
"I won't say they won't be a little suspicious, I mean, I promise I won't tell anyone, but Rose is Hermione's daughter, and she's pretty smart." Al said.
"Hermione?! My dad talks about her a lot!" Scorpius said as they sat down in their compartment. "And what does he say about my mother?" Rose said calmly, but she didn't look calm.
"H-He says she was the most beautiful girl he ever met. He really liked her when he was young. He still kind of does. Mum knows, but she's fine with it. And dad wants to be friends with your dad," Scorpius directed his speech to Al now, "He really wanted to, but after he became a Death Eater, and Harry saved him, he didn't think he was worthy to be your dads friend."
The compartment was silent for a minute. "Scorpius, who is this?" Missy asked. "My friend Bella Lamfyo." Scorpius said quickly. Rose narrowed her eyes at Scorpius and Bella.
"Hello Bella. I'm Rose Weasley." Rose said. "Hi." Bella said weakly. "Bella, why don't you take a nap. You need to rest." Scorpius said. "But-"
"No. Bella, take a nap. You know you need it." Scorpius cut her off. She nodded. "Okay. Okay, night." She whispered. She fell asleep quickly, and Rose instantly glared at Scorpius.
"Who is she really." Rose demanded. "Ro, if he doesn't want to tell you, he doesn't have to." Al said. "Albus Severus Potter! Do not stuck up for him! Who is she?" Ro said. "Like Al said. I don't have to tell you." Scorpius said quietly.
Ro glared at Scorpius. Suddenly she whispered in a voice, and Al knew Scorpius was a goner. It was her angelic sweet voice that could get anyone to cave in.
"Scorp. Please tell me who she is..." She said. "S-She's... She... My twin! She's my twin!" Scorpius jumped up, his hands flying up to his mouth. "I should have warned you about her angelic voice. Sorry. But Ro, why Scorp?" Al asked.
"Well I'm not going to always call him Scorpius, am I?" Ro asked. "No. Probably not. Missy, are you okay?" Al asked. "I-I. Yes. I'm f-fine. Perfectly fine." Missy replied, her voice shaking badly.
"Candy! Anyone want some candy. How about you dearie's?" She trolly woman asked them. "Yes please. We'd like Bertie Bott's Every Flavored Beans, Taffy Tongues, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble Best Blowing Gum, and Cauldron Cakes." Al said, paying for them.
