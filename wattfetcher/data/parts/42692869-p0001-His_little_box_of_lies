Emil has always been a good child. He always gets good grades in school, lives alone and peacefully along side his older brother, Lukas, and is kind to everyone he meets. He might be a little shy to others, not used to having many friends, but he is generous and truthful to everyone around him.
Well, not exactly.
His first lie was when he was seven. He said he went out to play with his friend. He actually went and took a walk alone in the winter snow, found himself a bird friend. He visits the bird everyday now. He named him Puffin.
After one simple lie, he felt as if he would be ripped apart. Even if what he did wasn't bad. He felt as if he wasn't being himself. He wrote down his lie on a piece of paper, and slid it into a shoe box from the last time him and his brother went shopping.
He lied next at the age of 9. He said he finished all his homework for the week. It killed him. He only had one math page left to do, and he wasn't so fond of math. He finished it soon after the lie. Once the homework was corrected, he went home and slipped a note with the lie written onto it, stappled to the sheet of homework, and put it in the little box of lies. He kept it under his bed for safe keeping.
By now, Emil is now 16. He still lives with his 20 year old brother, has a beautiful girlfriend named Miracle, and has always amazing scores in school.
Emil was always a good child. But when he lied, he would shred to pieces, fitting in a small shoe box for the rest of his life.
