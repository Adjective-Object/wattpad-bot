A lot of you guys have the same opinion. something tells me this poll will end very quickly. Now I have mix feelings about this her. I like her and I think she's a good character to have and all, it's just in the episode Rainbow Falls she lied about Soarin's injuries which isn't cool. Anyway if you voted her out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!

And the nominees are:
COCO POMMEL: Is a fashion designer in Manhattan. Worked for somepony who took advantage of Rarity's generosity. Soon later quit her job and gave Rarity her key. Rainbow Color Thread
CHEESE SANDWICH: Is a Super Duper Party Pony. Travels all over Equestria helping Parties in need. Stumbled into Ponyville one day as a colt and then was inspired by Pinkie Pie (HIS TRUE LOVE) to be a party pony. Years Later meets Pinkie again and she thinks he's trying to steal her spotlight (even though he was trying to impress her because HE LUVS HER!!!) Gives Pinkie her key. His Pet Rubber Chicken Boneless
DISCORD: Lord of Chaos. Was given orders by Princess Celestia to stop Tirek, but was tricked by him that he could give him something more powerful then Friendship. He sees that his decision was wrong and then gives Twilight her key. A Madelon
Good luck to the nominees!
