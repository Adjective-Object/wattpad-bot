"Deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaan!"
This was what Dean woke up to - his husband sitting on top of him, poking his face and whining.
He groaned. "Cas?"
"Dean!" Cas yelled happily.
"What the hell are you doing?"
"Waiting for you to wake up." Cas flopped off of Dean, to the other side of the bed. "Dean, I'm bored."
"Mhmm," Dean mumbled, drifting back to sleep.
"Dean!" Cas yelled in his ear. "Entertain me."
"Ugh, it's like, six am. Whatever," Dean groaned. "Fine. Wait here," he said, getting up. Castiel got up and followed Dean to Sam's room in the bunker.
"Shh," Dean warned Cas, before opening the door and tip-toeing in, Cas following. He went to Sam's table and grabbed his laptop, then exited the room.
"Dean, what if he finds-" Dean cut him off with a kiss.
"Don't worry about it."

Once they got back to their room, they got into a comfortable position - Castiel in between Dean's legs, and the laptop on his lap, popcorn beside them - they logged into Netflix. (On Sam's account.)
"What do ya wanna watch, honeybee?" Dean asked, scrolling through the various tv shows and movies of Netflix.
"Something happy. And sweet. And romantic."
"Right so, a Disney movie," Dean joked.
"I don't know who Disney is, but that sounds nice," Cas replied seriously.
"I... okay." Dean sighed. "Well, there are about a hundred different Disney movies. Which one do you wanna see?" He pulled up a variety of Disney movies.
Cas spotted The Little Mermaid. "That one." He pointed.

Every time Ursula was onscreen, Cas would cuddle closer into Dean.
"You okay, Cas?" Dean asked.
"I am fine. Ursula is just..."
"Creepy?"
"A little, yeah."
"It's okay." Dean kissed the top of Cas' head. "I'll protect you." Cas turned around to give Dean a quick kiss.

Cas gasped. "How... how could she do that?!"
"She's a sea witch, Cas."
"That doesn't excuse anything!"
"I know, honeybee. She's just a bad person."
Cas threw popcorn at the screen.
"Hey don't do that," Dean reprimanded, "I'm only gonna have you clean it up later."
"I don't care! She shouldn't have stolen Ariel's man!"
"Hey you better clean up your act... or I'll have to resort to... tickle-torture."
"You wouldn't."
Dean paused the movie. "Wouldn't I?"
"Dean, you better n-" Dean began tickling Cas. "Dean! Stooooop!"
"Oh, am I bothering you?"
"YEESSSSS! STAAAAHHHHP IT!" he shrieked. They were on the floor now, movie forgotten.
