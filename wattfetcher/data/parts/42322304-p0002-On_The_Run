I woke up coughing, trying to keep down the dinner they gave me. It had been 2 months since they found me, and captured me. 2 months of torture. 2 months of interrogation. I sat up, rubbing the tiredness out of my eyes.
There would be another interrogation today. Probably agent Ward. He's the usual interrogator.
I sighed. I was bored. The cell I was in was tiny, with metal walls, and floors, no windows. There was a digital clock in the corner that read 3:14. Interrogation was at 3:30. There was a bed with white sheets and blankets. There was a metal bedside table with a pitcher of old water, a single cup, and a plate with leftovers from last nights dinner.
Unseasoned pork, mashed potatoes, and softened vegetables.
Every night.
The same thing. I shifted on my bed slightly nervous about what devices Agent Ward would for me today. A cold shiver went down my spine. I glanced back at the clock.
3:19.
I swallowed hard, and closed my eyes. Maybe if he thought I was sleeping, he wouldn't come in, I hoped. Trying to slow down my breathing, I laid down once again, gulping down deep breaths.
In.
Out.
In.
Out.
Until darkness took me.

I woke up to the sound of banging on metal. My eyes fluttered open and I saw Agent Ward standing opposite to me, banging his hand on the wall.
"Get up you little runt." He spat. I squinted my eyes slightly. Something was different.
"Awwh did you and your girlfriend have another argument?" I said tauntingly. His eye twitched slightly.
"No, there's someone here to see you, interrogation has been moved to 4:00." He walked over to the cell door and unhitched the lock. I sighed rolling my eyes. A girl stepped into my cell. She was average height with long brown hair.
"Hi," she said, "I'm Skye."
