"Become my slave and he'll live." St.Marie ordered pointing a gun to his head. Normally a person would say yes and be completely done with it.

But to become a slave?

Millie sat there with her head bowed, her bangs covering her eyes. She muffled 'yes' and 'go ahead' from the crowds. Clearly, they wanted to save their King. Millie thought for a while. This was a lot to take in for a mere seven-year old.

"Millie-nee!" Sayo screamed, this quickly got Millie's and the crowd's attention.

"You don't have to go!"

"Yeah, we want you to stay and play with us!" Gemi agreed. Millie started to cry and the crowds couldn't help but stay quiet.

"No matter what you do, I'll support you but I want you to stay so that I can see you grow into the beautiful, strong young woman that you were meant to be."

"Okaa-san." Millie called crying slightly.  That was until she felt a firm pair of arms wrap themselves around her. Millie looked up and saw her father hugging her.

"Otou-san."

"Millie, I want you to understand something. When they place that mark on you, you wouldn't be considered a person anymore. You would lose all you freedom. Do you understand me?"

"Yes, Otou-san."

Millie walked up to the Noble.

"Oh, have you finally made up your mind?" She asked.

"Yes. I-I.."

Everyone was silent. They wanted to hear Twilight's answer loud and clear but mostly because the poor girl was generally soft-spoken.

"I will become your slave!"
