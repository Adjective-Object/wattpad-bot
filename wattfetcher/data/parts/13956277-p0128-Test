"STOP" I shouted while I was laughing, "No, say it !" Simon was tickling me, "Never" I kicked him and flipped us, he became beneath me and I was on top of him tickling him, "SAY IT" I commanded, "Okay Okay stop, I-I love you" Simon confessed.
We were in my new house, in America, we were alone and Karam was going to be here in 2 weeks...
A week ago :
"Are you ready?" I asked Karam as we were about to go ask for his other half's hand, "I guess so" He was shaking from head to toe, "Come here, big boy" I pulled him and fixed his suit. Me and Karam passed by a flower shop and bought a bouquet of red roses, 10 minutes later, we were standing in front of her house and .... surprise .
She was walking out of her house, wearing a beautiful white dress, walking hand in hand with her father, who handed her to a man that came out of a Mercedes covered with roses and ribbons. She was getting married.
Karam got out of the car, holding the roses in his hand, he couldn't look away from the bride that couldn't  look any worse, she wasn't happy at all while her husband held her hand. Karam walked toward them, I tried to stop him, I ran after him but he was already standing in front of them. The bride's eyes got widened, "Congratulations" Karam said and handed the husband the red roses then came back and got into the car. "When are we going to America?" He asked as he turned the car on and tried to turn his tears off, "When your visa and papers are out" I said. What can you possibly say to a man that've just seen the woman of his dreams getting married to another man ? ... sorry? No.

"And I love your hard abs" I giggled as Simon took off his shirt, "Ready for some wrestling?"  He asked, "Oh yeah babe, let me get ready" I got to my room and changed into shorts then walked back down, "*Whistles* of course I'm going to let you win in those shorts" He said and I exploaded in laughter, "Oh shut up" I shooed him off, "Get ready, steady. GO" I ran to him, jumped, kicked his chest and he fell, "What ! NO ! I wasn't ready", "Yeah Yeah, excuses ..." I rolled my eyes and he surprisingly lifted me over his shoulder and threw me in the air, then I landed on the couch, "Who's the boss now?" He said, I kept my eyes shut and stopped myself from breathing, "Come on" He poked me, "Leena, stop joking" He tickled me but I didn't move, "Leena" He started to freak out and shaking me like crazy, "I am" I jumped on him and his back hit the floor forcefully, "At least, that's a position we're not always in" He winked at me and I jumped away from him, "Shut up" I walked to the kitchen, "If Molly knows that you're here, she's going to kill me" He said, "Is it bad that I want us to spend some time alone with nobody to bother us?".
Nobody knew that I was back to America but Simon and Karam, I wasn't ready for school yet.
"Let's go out" I told Simon who was watching TV and eating popcorn, "Sure, wherever you want" He said, "Okay, I'lol be ready in 5" I walked to my room, picked jeans shorts, white tight blouse and red heels, I walked down to the living room and stood in front of the TV. Simom dropped the bowl of popcorn and coughed, "Are you going out like this?" He checked me out from head to toe, "Yes, why?" I raised an eyebrow, "Because, that's not you, you don't dress like this, I kind of miss Old Leena, with long skirts and loose blouses" He said with a straight face, "Well, don't you like the new Leena?" I asked as I put my hand on his neck and kissed his lips, "No, I love her" He said.
.....
"Remember the girls the the orphanage?" Simon asked, "Yeah? What's wrong with them?" I took a bite from my sandwich, "What are we going to do about them?" Hr asked, "Nothing. That's their faith, we can't change faith. That's what God chose for them. Let's just forget about them and have fun"
