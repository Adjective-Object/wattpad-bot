A/N : I know this chapter is short but don't worry
*Jade's POV*
I'm tired. I've barely slept this week. But I must keep going. I have to, for him. I'll admit, he has caused me heartache and confusion past the point of which I should just forget about him, but I know he's a good person. I love him.
I guess I should introduce myself. My name's Jade. Jade Emalyne Thorton. I'm fourteen years old and unfortunately an eighth-grader at Pillancy Junior High School. Or I was, I should say, but i'll explain that later.
It all started when I moved to Pillancy. I move a lot, so I was used to being the new kid, but Dad said that we'd be staying here a while so on my first day of course I was nervous. I knew I'd have to make some friends to survive, allies at the least.
After about a week, I started getting used to the place. No, I didn't have any friends, but I was getting by ok. The whole school hated me, I hated them.  Fair enough. Yes their bullying and taunting was torture, but I've had worse.
After three weeks things were still the same. Then on a dreary monday morning, there was a new student presented to period one science. He had beautiful blue eyes and curly brown hair. He looked about my age. He almost instantly attracted most the class so I knew I'd better stay away from him. I could already tell who was going to go after him. Maddy and Daryn. Afterall, they were they were the kind of people to want anything with legs and a heart beat.
"Uh, hi, my name's Chandler" he finally mumbled. Our teacher, Mr. Stones, Immediately pointed him over to the only empty seat, which of course was right next to Daryn. All through class, even though I secretly had earbuds in, I noticed Daryn flirting with Chandler, meanwhile Chandler looking very distressed and Maddy glaring at them the whole time. I'll admit, I was a little excited to see how this would work out.
