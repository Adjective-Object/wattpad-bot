The moon eyed girl, I wonder, I wonder what her smiles hide, I wonder what her heart hides, I wonder how she deals with it, I wonder if she'll ever let anyone in, I wonder if her moon eyes will fade, I wonder when she will fix what she broke, I wonder if she'll ever get why I think she's perfect, I wonder if she will stay, I wonder if she knows that I see her when no one else does, I wonder when she'll love me too..
