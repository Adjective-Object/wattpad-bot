Jordan's POV
With Boo and Erin living here, I've become more girly.
"Come on, please." They both begged.
"No, I'm not doing it."
"Please, Jordan." Erin said before mouthing "I love you" with a "sorry" look on her face.
"Fine... I'll do it. God I hate myself for this." I said getting my keys.
"Yes!" Boo screamed.
"High five!" Erin screamed before giving Boo a big high five and picking her up.
"Thank you, Jordan." Boo said.
"You're very welcome." I responded.
"Thanks, babe." Erin said before giving me a kiss.
"You're gonna pay for this... and you're welcome." I said walking out the door.
I got in my car and drove home after buying... a makeup desk thing and a doll house, It is Boo's birthday though.
"YAY!" Boo yelled running over to me hugging my leg.
"Wait, I gotta put the box down." I said referring to the giant makeup desk thing box I was holding.
"Set it up." She said jumping on Erin's back.
"I will." I said cutting the tape on the box open with my key.
"Thank you so much, Jordan." Erin said.
"Wow, okay how does this work?" I asked pulling a piece of wood with swinging mirror holders on it out of the box.
"Gimme." Erin said reaching for it before putting Boo down.
"You set it up then, I have no idea how. I'm still making you pay for what I did for you." I said looking and pointing at the both of them.
"Don't worry, your version of making me pay is my version of generosity... " She said. "And it takes place once she falls asleep." She whispered pointing at Boo.
"Thank you, Jordan." Boo said hugging Jordan.
"We have to get going, Boo. You'll meet us there?" Erin asked.
"Yeah, I'll be there around three." I said.
I got to the party to see a million kids running around laughing, I couldn't find Erin or Boo.
"Jordan!" Erin said running over to me, hair bouncing and smile growing.
"He -- " I tried to say before being cut off by her kissing me.
"Hi." She said with an exhale.
"Oh, hey." I said.
"You should meet some people, come on. This is Lisa, Boo goes to school with her daughter."
"Hi, and you must be the Jordan she's been talking about." Lisa said.
"That I am, unless there's another one I don't know about." I said
"Yeah, she has told me so many times how sweet you are." She said.
"Really, I'm not that sweet... I didn't think I was that sweet." I said.
"You're really sweet, Jordan... " Erin said before giving my a kiss on the cheek. "Very sweet." She finished.
"Thank you." I said.
"Oh young love." Lisa said putting her hand on her chest as Erin's hand slipped into mine.
"I love you, you know that." I said looking into Erin's eyes with our heads leaning against one another.
