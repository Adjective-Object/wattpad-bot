A truth amd a lie are two different things. But when you tell the truth to cover up your lies, aren't they just the same then?
Some say you live and you learn and you never make the same mistake twice. Then explain gamblers that make money just to gamble it away again, prostitutes who have been caught but continue, parroliers that already have two strikes, prisoners that have been to prison more than once, murderers who know they are doing wrong but keep killing, rapists who know they are breaking innocent hearts but don't stop. Some don't live, some don't learn, some still make the same mistakes.
People have dreams to make it big, to be famous, and have unlimited money. I have a dream, a simple dream, to live to see tomorrow. Everyday I stay alive, I'm fulfilling my dream, have you?
Someone once asked me, "Why do you love someone who will never love you back?"
I replied, "Why do you breathe if you know you'll eventually die?
That person never spoke to me again.
Love is like a shooting star, it's hard to find, and when you see it you should act quickly. They are both very rare.
Sometimes more words are better than less words. Sometimes less words are better than no words. But sometimes no words are better than nothing at all.
I prefer my heart to be broken. That way when I meet someone they can mend it. I'd rather know they can fix my heart in the beginning then to have them break it over and over, again and again.
Numbing the pain for a while will only make it worse when you finally feel the pain.
The world is really, really stupid. If you want to live on this really, really world you have to really, really smart.
Why is it that whenever I cry, I always give the excuse that my eyes are watering?
It takes rain to create a rainbow, but a storm to create something truly unique and beautiful.
