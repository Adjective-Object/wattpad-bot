"Me? Why do I have to do it? Mom told you to do it." Logan pointed out.
"But I took the blame for it." I said.
"But neither of us did it."
"So? Now, clean it up."
"No."
"I swear, Logan, I will take your bat and swing it at you so hard, you'll fly into the next century. Now, clean it up."
"Um..."
"Are you seriously thinking about your choice at living?"
"Fine. I'll clean it up. But you owe me something."
"I don't owe you shit."
"Yes, you do."
"The bat swinging is still an option in this conversation."
"Fine!"
"I thought so." I smirked as I watched Logan pick up every broken glass piece off the floor. I almost felt sorry for him, because of the fact he was picking up sharp glass, but it slipped away... as usual.
After watching my little shit of a brother clean everything up, we both went upstairs to our rooms. I quickly ran to my room and shut the door. I fell onto my bed face first, rethinking my whole life. I turned over to stare at the ceiling, only finding the stupid human figure again. We screamed again for some seconds until I managed to shut my mouth.
"W-who... are... y-you..?" I stuttered while sitting up.
"Who are you?" The figure asked me while moving backwards so we could face each other.
"I-I asked f-first." I replied.
"Well, just answer mine." The figure commanded.
"I'm Charlie the human." I said, finally without stuttering.
"Hi, Charlie the human. I'm Amy... a ghost..." The figure replied.
"First off, it's just Charlie. And second... a ghost?" I questioned.
"Ok, just Charlie. And yeah." The figure -- Amy -- responded.
"No. The name's Charlie. And are you sure you're a ghost?" I corrected her.
"Oh, ok, Charlie. And I'm positive I'm a ghost. Sorry for scaring you earlier." Amy said.
"You should be. I rarely even get scared." I told her.
"Oops. Sorry." She apologized once again.
"Yeah. Whatever. Anyway, how am I supposed to know you're a ghost?" I questioned her.
"Because I'm transparent obviously." Amy stated. She was right. Her whole body just looked like a pale, blue, glowing light. There was no other color on her.
"I can see that. But what else?" I continued testing her.
"I can float, I can fly, you can walk right through me, you can-" Amy stated her qualities.
"Ok, ok! I get it! You're an actually ghost! But how am I seeing you and talking to you? Why are you even here? Am I the only one to see figures like you? Am I going mad?!" I rambled.
"Woah, woah," She interrupted me,Â  "I don't even know one answer to one of your questions. Just stop asking."
"Alright. I'm just freaking out." I agreed.
"Charlotte, honey. What's wrong?" Mom asked from outside my door. I turned my head to the door.
