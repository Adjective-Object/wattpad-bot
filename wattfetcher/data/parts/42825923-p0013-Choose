"So where are Aaron,carter and Taylor?" Mayra asked.
"I don't-what- wait how do you know them?" Jack G asked,raising his head up to meet Mayra's eyes.
"We know all of you.You know...Magcon and all." I replied with a small laugh.
"You knew about us before you actually met us?" Cameron asked,raising an eyebrow.
"How could we not?Mayra and I know Jack and Jacks music and all of your vines and videos." I said,smiling at Jack j.
"Well Tay,Carter and Aaron went on a trip to who knows where." Nash said,shrugging his shoulder.
"So what's your favorite song?" Jack J asked,keeping his gaze on me.
"Hmm...well I'm kind of stuck between Wild Life and Tides.I don't know." I responded,playing around with my thumbs.
Both Jacks nodded.
"I'm just surprised you two didn't fan girl or faint when you met us.Or when Jack was giving you a hickey or when you and I were making out.Though I wouldn't mind." Matt said giving me a wink.
"We like to keep our cool." I replied with a grin.I turned to look at Jack to see he was tensing up.I scooted closer to him and gave him a smile signaling "it's okay."He nodded at my gesture.
"So Mayra,are you a Gilinsky or Johnson girl?" Shawn asked,breaking the silence.
"Gilinsky." she shyly replied.
"What about you Alexandra?" Shawn asked,turning his gaze towards me.
"Please,call me Alex,and I'm 100% a Johnson girl." I replied,smiling at Jack J.
"So you don't mind the mark he gave you?" Shawn smirked.
"It's whatever." I said,shrugging my shoulders.I could feel heat rushing up to my cheeks at turned my head to see Jacks cheeks were a shade of pink too.
"Mayra do you have make up right now?" I asked,trying to change the subject.
"Yeah why?" She responded.
"I need to cover up the hickey."-
