there are three steps to being successful in this business. only three. no loopholes, no exceptions, no excuses.
STEP ONE: watch.
you are to be observant in every sense. you will know everything about your subject, and you will watch them to the point where you can pick them out in a crowd. the way they walk, the way their jaw twitches when they talk, the way they look at certain things... you will know it all.
STEP TWO: learn.
when you meet your subject, you are to learn everything there is to know. what makes them tick, what makes them upset, what makes them lustful. make them trust you wholeheartedly.
STEP THREE: end.
this is the fun part. you are to end it. quickly, graphically, and as gory as you possibly can. it doesn't matter how you do it, just as long as it's done. you only know you've failed if you feel anything afterwards or if their parents can still recognize their child's face.
do i make myself clear?
