niall
the drums started playing, I was ready to sing my newest single, "you don't know me."
i wrote this song just for the haters, or the people who think they know every single tiny detail about my life.
i stepped on stage, and heard all the screams and chants of my name.
i started to sing.
"center of attention, once againthey don't understand..."
once i was done, every scream that was heard at the beginning of the song, was even louder and crazier.
"thank you, everyone! it was amazing to perform here for you all, hope you enjoyed my new song!"
i stepped off stage and everyone started congratulating me.
i was on my way to my dressing room, when someone taps my shoulder.
i turn around. "hey, im harry styles."
"uh, niall. niall horan."
"i know."
"what? uh, alright. i better get going."
"wait!" he stops me from leaving. "i bet i know a lot about you. so that song won't refer to me."
i was confused. "well, not really. i don't even know you, how are you supposed to know me?"
"i'll prove it, only if you let me, niall james horan."
"how would you do that, harry styles?"
"you'll see," he hands me his phone number and leaves.
"weird, really weird."
and with that, i go back to my dressing room.
