Hello. My name is Subject 17. Or at least that's what they tell me. I live in a glass box inside a blank white room. I don't remember how I got here, just that I'm here now. Every day they come in through an invisible door in they wall. They stare at me like I am some kind of bizarre science experiment when really, they are the bizarre ones. I think there is something wrong with me because every day when they come in I know that I've forgotten something. That something's missing. I just can't figure out what it is. I'm stuck here. In this box. On the inside. And I can't get out.
Before you read any farther I should tell you that by reading this you are in danger. The New Era has begun even if you don't realize it yet; it's true. You are taking huge risks just reading this prologue. But if you really, truly have the courage to join the rebellion, you could become a hero.
I don't remember who I am or where I came from. But I do know I am different. I have blonde hair that goes down to my waist. I can tell from the slight reflection in the glass that my eyes are hazel green. I can't tell how tall I am because I can't stand up in this box. By looking at myself I would say I am about fourteen years old.
I don't know how but I'm different from them. They keep saying, "So this is the hybrid. The legendary Subject 17."
So here I am, inside this box. Not knowing if it is day or night because of the blinding fluorescent lights. Waiting for the knight in shining armor that is never, ever going to come.
