Fine. Ok. You're lost right now. You're young and you have no idea what you're going to do with the rest of your life, your existence, whatever you call it. And it terrifies you. It scares you to death. You are literally so scared you want to die. But even after everything that's happened, and trust me, I've always been there and I know you've been through a lot, you are still here. For fuck's sake, at least you are trying. Don't you dare say you aren't. Because I know you are afraid of dying even more than you are of living. I am you. We have been here. I have been here. You will not sit back and watch our life disappear. I will not let you. So I suggest you get up off your sorry ass and do something. You are being a damn drama king. You hear me. Suck it up. You are not weak. We are not weak. So don't you dare give up.Not now. I have kept you alive for too long for you to ruin it. I will not leave again. I will not fail again. This is one of the strangest forms I have ever been put in but I will keep it alive. I'll tell you what's weak.Your will. Not mine, yours. I can't change that. I can help but I can't give you a desire to live. Find your reason to live and hold on as tightly as you can. And if you ever decide to stop listening to me again I will find a way to force you. I am here for a reason. Your dreams are not just dreams. Pay attention. You need to learn.
