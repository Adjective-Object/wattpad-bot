Haruka: 0///0 That's right. We are merely having a dry run before Ace-sama comes back.
Zoro: So what exactly are we supposed to talk about?

Law: Someone brings up a random topic and we talk.
Haruka: *sweatdrops* Or get seriously deformed.

*Zoro reads the chapter*

Zoro: Why are you like the Ero-cook?
Haruka; I'm not like that peverted ass.

Zoro: Then why did you faint when you thought of Ace?
Haruka: 0///0........

Law: Yes. I'm quite intrigued by your homosexual tendencies.
Mihawk: This better be good because the generator at my house broke down and I missed the two and half marathon of The Young and the Restless.

Everyone: 0.0 wut?
Haruka: 0///0..I don't have any fantasies for Ace-sama, whatsoever.

Law: Let's try that. Oh Saki-ya, I havee Honey roasted ham for you~

*Sakura/Authour-chan who was in the South Blue arrived at Fishman Island in 0.00001 seconds*

Sakura: *Her eyes are sparkling and she has drool oozing out* Honey Roasted Ham!
Ace: *who was breathing heavily*  Finally.

Ace who, at that particular moment, had his hat resting on his firm shouldeers. His hair was glossy from all the sweat he perspired during his run after Sakura. To the most observant fangirl, they coud see the bead of sweat gently trickle down his abs.

Sakura: Holy shit, did I just write that? *dies from pure fangirling*
Haruka: Such vivid imagery. *faints from massive nosebleed*

Law: Damn.
Zoro: Shouldn't you help them?
Law: Maybe..*smirks* maybe not.

*Haruka who somehow raise himself up died from another massive nosebleed*

Mihawk:This is almost better than my soaps.
Zoro: Please don't ever mention that again because the thought is wrong.

Random crossover from Fairy Tail...

Sting: Hey yo!
Sakura: Sting-sama!

Haruka: Sting-kun is here! *faints from a massive nosebleed similar to the one Sanji had on Fishman Island.
