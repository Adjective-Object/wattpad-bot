I breathe in the air.
Air that has been contaminated by cigarette smoke.
Although, I can't physically survive without the air that gives me life.
So why does it slowly kill me by breathing in something that helps me survive?

I'm not a smoker, my mom is so if you're wondering why I wrote this, there's that. Haha
