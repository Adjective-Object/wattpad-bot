After your father left, we haven't been financially stable. Now make sure you tell Grace about this.
I can't believe it. How am I going to tell Grace about this? How am I going to tell her that I like her.

It's about 2 minutes until lunch and I still don't know how to say it to her.

Grace cried on my shoulder and my nirvana shirt is getting really damp near the top section of my body. As I felt her warm tears land on me, I could feel my eyes start to water. How could I leave Grace like this? After nearly 10 years of being with her, why am I leaving her now. The next thing I know I'm crying too.
Calum approached us and asked us what was happening. How can I leave all my friends? Most importantly, how can I go without Grace by me?
