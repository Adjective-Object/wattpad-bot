I can feel your fingers ghosting over my skin the same way I can feel the memories that come flooding back reminding me of our fall. Mistaken kindness, if that is what you call it can be detrimental to someone like me.  As innocent as children, but so far gone down the road of corruption that it was nearly impossible to tell.  You were my everything while I wasn't anything special to you.  You used up all my happiness and joy the same way you've done to everyone else just to leave me with hatred and darkness. I'm better now, trust me in this, but you still remain the subject to many of my writings despite the fact I have lost my love for you.  It's easy to write about something that affected you so greatly that one instance can change your life forever. You've made me the person I am today, and I don't know if that is good or bad.  I hope you find true happiness, the one you have feigned your entire life doesn't put you to sleep with a smile on your face looking forward to the morning sun.  I promised I would never hurt you, but once you broke me in two all promises were called off. To be honest with myself I don't think I could ever hurt you. Those  who are closest to you develop characteristics of the other, and if this wasn't a sign from the heavens that I was more invested in the relationship that you ever were I don't know what is. I still struggle to break the habits that I have taken on because of you, but to my knowledge I never greatly affected you enough to change you.
