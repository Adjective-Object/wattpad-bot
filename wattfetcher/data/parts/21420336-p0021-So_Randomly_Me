I haven't ranted in a while, I like ranting.
Straight to the point:
There are many things that bother me about Pjo or HoO Fanfics, let me just list some xD.
☆don't take anything personally☆
1- WHY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER LIKE ALWAYS A DAUGHTER OF POSEIDON??
It's like,"Oh hey, I'm a daughter of poseidon, and somehow, I'm also Percys full sister."
Sally how busy have you been girl? ?? And with Poseidon!! wait, how did Percy not know in the first place??
2- Fanfics be like:
day 1: I hate Nico so much!!!
day 2: (yes im exaggerating) OMGS NICO LETS KISS EVERY TWO SECONDS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE LIKE 13 XD XD
3- first day at camp: Lets go beat up Percy with no training, and win.
Im just there like," No child, this guy, the one you want to fight, killed Kronos, how bout you fight me, Im pretty useless :D!"
4- I think I have never seen a daughter of Hermes before  in fanfics actually, HERMES ROCKS PEOPLE LETS BE CREATIVE! ☆★☆★
5- Characters be like,"MHMMM GURL IM A DAUGHTER OF THE SEA GOD BLESSED BY EVERYONE, BE JELLY!"
xD do I really have to say why these bother me? no? meh I'll say it anyway, 'cause I love talking/typing.
All I'm saying is,"How are you blessed by more gods than percy o.O I need your secrets!"
6- Why isnt there boy characters o~o.
explanation: I need new things to fangirl over, and I really really need a guy character.
7- The girl characters are always like,"Ugh I wish I was prettier like, im so ugly! I have silky blonde hair and ocean blue eyes, with a beautiful tan body. And I weigh like 100 pounds!"
*cries* Dude, I have brown thick hair, poop brown eyes and I'm pale! If your ugly than I must be disgusting! (lol im not even gonna tell you how much I weigh xD)
-----------
I'm sorry I just needed to type it, and I havent updated lately. if you are writing a fanfic do t be discourage, I still like the Fanfics, as long as they have a good plot!!
Also, school starts monday, -.- yay bullies and popular people! *note sarcasm*
its gonna be so fun because I have so many friends *also sarcasm* -.-

(sorry for horrible spelling, I'm using my tablet, I tried my best D:)
