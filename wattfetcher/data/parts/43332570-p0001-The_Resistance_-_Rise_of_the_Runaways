As we walked through the demolished streets of a neighborhood many people used tocall home, the bottles that were tied to trees clinked together, as if there was a slight breeze. Weall knew there would never be a 'breeze' again, they already destroyed whatever weatherpatterns that may have been normal in a past time. The condition of the air was comparable to anuclear winter with tiny remnants of former housing complexes floating through the air, making itharder to breath. The speakers that were placed somewhere in the ashen sky above us frazzledto life over the sound of our heavy breathing.
"Dear citizens of the new fallout," the ominous voice rang as gunshot fired from far away.It sounded like two, maybe three guns were turned against one another. "For too long oursociety has succumbed to the tyranny of our own actions." The group came to a slow stop andlooked to the skies. Some darted theirs heads back and forth with their sights lined up andpointed to the sky, some holding their child closer as if they could protect them, but not I. Istared at the soot-covered faces of my comrades. Those of us that have been here from thebeginning, and the new Runaways.
"War, riots," He paused, "We have tolerated the scum and have graciously cleaned upthe mess. Well no more!" We had been traveling for so long, bringing our newest recruits tobase. We had fought our way through the formerly beautiful city, now crumbling from the neglectbrought on by frightened civilians.
"You have all been a consequence of the disease known as freedom, and now it is timeto take that freedom away! As of today, you will be stripped of your identity, and anything youhold dear in life - for it is your individuality that has led to your destruction. Your children will beleft to rot as punishment for your indiscretion, and the lives you have lived until now will benothing but a memory." The final shots fired in the distance. They forced this upon themselves.
"This is for the survival of the race! This is for the New Fallout! This is the end!" Thegroup trudged forwards. The new recruits were scared, but they followed their leaders everymove. Every one of them were quaking in there boots when the base door came into view. Thenew Runaways must pledge their lives to the Resistance. As dark as it may be, we can't haveany traitors or our actions would be meaningless.
"In the darkest night, the faintest light is blinding." It started with the youngest, a smallchild. The child looked to its father.
"In the darkest night the faintest light is blinding." It echoed throughout the rest of them.
"In the darkest night the faintest light is blinding." The doors opened and our leader,Gareth, stepped back. Our song, our last tradition, rang through the speakers. The wordsalmost too fuzzy and distant to hear.
For my fallen stars,

Banner men, ready for your call to arms!
And for my broken heart,

It's time to take back what we thought we lost.
For my fallen stars,

Banner men, ready for your call to arms!
And for my broken heart,

It's time to take back what we thought we lost.
This is the resistance!

It's a call to arms,
The anthem for all those who don't belong.

We're here to take our stand.
This is the resistance!

It's been far too long,
That we've put all our faith in to the corrupt.

It's time to start the end!
