Brielle's pov: we went to the arena and Mato gave out the next compition "Now in todays event we have a tower of 600 monsters and the Mpf now please pick a contestant" Mato said "I'm going" Gajeel said cracking his knuckles and grinning till Laxus said lightly hitting Gajeels chest telling him to stop "Why when Bri is already there" I walked and went into the castle and saw Natsu, Ethia, Risley, Têcask, Spencèr and Ichiya lined up beside me then the bell rung. Five seconds later: " Brielle Vermilion finished the other competitors, Monsters and all Mpfs in just five seconds folk this is going into the Grand Magic Game record earning 205 points the scores now: A&d : 901Bp709Sc: 504Rr: 300Mh: 110Ft: 70 tomorrow is the last day and then we will announce our winner so please go and have a great sleep" I can't wait to demolish those stupid Fairies.
