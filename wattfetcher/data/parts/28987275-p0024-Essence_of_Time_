"Thank you, Detective," Dad said, closing the door behind Porter.
I watched as Mom and Dad embraced. Dad caressed Mom's hair. "It'll be okay, Shelby. They'll find her... they'll find her."
I felt like it was an intrusion of their privacy to linger and witness their affectionate moment. Soundlessly, I made my way back up the steps and into my bedroom. I shut the door as quietly as possible.
I made a beeline for my desk and pulled a blank notebook from my drawer. I flipped to the fifth page and titled it:
Finding Savannah Bree Chamberlayne
It was a lame title, I know, but all that mattered was that I was going to find Savannah. Without the police. Without my parents' consent. I would find her with the help of Serena and Jasmine, and the use of my own abilities. If I was smart and did this right, that's all I would need.
