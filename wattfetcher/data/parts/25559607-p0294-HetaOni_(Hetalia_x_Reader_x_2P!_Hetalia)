"I-I couldn't make it in time-" Italy muttered under his breath.

Past Germany spoke, his voice cracking. "I-Italy-"

"Aaargh! What am I going to do? I'm surrounded by Germanies!! What am I giong to tell him?!" Italy thought frantically.

Walking over to Italy, Past Germany sighed in relief.  "Th-thank God...I thought you were...dead...Hahah! It was just...a dream..."

"No...I..." Italy turned around to face Past Germany.

Past Germany began to smile crookedly and run his fingers through his hair. "Yes...you couldn't...possibly die...You're a nation...It was just a dream! Isn't that right, Italy?!" he said, grabbing his arm with a little force.


Italy winced at the pressure on his arm. "Ow! Wait-hey, Germany! Listen to me! I-"

"Yes, that's right. I did find it...odd...that someone useless like you...Hahah! That'd be odd, Italy...Everyone thought you were dead..." Germany laughed, seeming to be out of himself.

"Germany..." Italy removed the past nation's grip on him.

Taking a step back, Past Germany spoke, "Everyone thought you were dead...Prussia, Japan...everyone...Right? Isn't that odd?"

"Um..." Italy answered, not knowing what to do.

Pointing to the door, Past Germany spoke to Italy.  "Let's go back, Italy. We have to prove to them that you're alive...Come on, let's go back, okay?"

"...Germany?" Italy said in a questioning tone, feeling something off about the man in front of him. "There's something different about him. But what?" he thought.

"Let's go back, Italy. We made a promise, remember? You promised you would wait for me...and I promised I would come back." Past Germany told him with a smile.


Upon hearing those words, Italy's eyes widened.


He knew there was one thing he could do.


Taking a deep breath, Italy slapped Past Germany.

Both of them had a surprised look on their face after Italy's action. Past Germany felt stunned by what just happened. "I-Italy?"

"Hold on, Germany!! You're not like that!! You wouldn't say things like that!!" Italy shouted at him. It wasn't the Germany he knew. If anything he was...he was acting like he was....

Italy's whole body shook. He then pointed at Past Germany and spoke, "Y-you!! You're ridiculously serious! You only do what manuals say, a-and you raise dogs, and you're buff, and you're hobby is making sweets-"
