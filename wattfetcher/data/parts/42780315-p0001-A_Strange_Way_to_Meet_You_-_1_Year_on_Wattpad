Wow, is all I can say.
It hasn't been a full year yet, but by now I had read my first fanfiction and been shocked at first, but then grew to love them more than anything.
But hey, let's save the soppy stuff for the end.
I didn't have to do something like this, I'm doing it as a thank you to my followers :) (note that this won't be very well written or have a very good storyline, it's basically a shoutout.)
I asked a while ago if anyone would be willing to be part of a special thing, and here it is! A few people replied, and they're all in here.
There will be five chapters, the first being posted on the 25th June and the last being posted on the 30th.
I hope you enjoy this little story!
