If you comment then comment.  I may or may not reply.  If you comment something rude than by all means go ahead, vent your thoughts out, but I, again, may or may not reply.  Honestly if you don't like my book you can go ahead and tell me.  If you want to give me your mean comments than go ahead.  I am totally fine with it.  I might comment back and it may be something about how you can hate all you want but your opinion may not be taken into consideration.  Now if you want to comment nicely, give me tips/ advise (which ever you want to call it), or vent about how you like something or someone in the story go ahead ^_^  I'd really appreciate it.  It'd be nice to see someone like my story so much.
Now to the point of this long ass message.  I'll be doing my best to update and of you who read My Life as a Hybrid Princess will be reconstructed.  Then this may go On Hold.  Also the story is almost over.  Although if you want it to go ongoing and me to have another book with them in college or somthing I can.  Also I am thinking about changing the title.  If I do what would ya'll want it to be called?
1. The Werewolf and the Spy.
2. The Spy's Werewolf
3. My Boyfriend is a Spy?
4. He's my Spy.
Or do ya'll like the title as it is?
Anyways, I'm done.
