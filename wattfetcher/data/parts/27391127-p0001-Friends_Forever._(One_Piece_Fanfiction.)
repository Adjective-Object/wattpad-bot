That's all she had to do. She promised him that she'll do it. Yeah she will. A promise made and sealed with a bracelet that she now holds dear.
She gulped. She was far too nervous. This was one of the best schools ever, literally but it was also the worst.
The Grandline School for the Gifted. In normal society, its called the school for freaks. The school for kids like herself, who have being rejected from society and has been classified as a freak.
She stood outside the iron gate. She looked left and looked right. Then she realized, "Where the hell does this property end?"
She directed her attention to the gate. It was just begging her to walk through. To take the first few steps of bravery that she wouldn't possible possess.
It was now or never. The task-force might be here soon and she doesn't want to be caught up in the mess. She opened the massive gate. It creaked as it slowly opened its self.
Sakura swore that she saw a bright light before everything got dim. The Grandline Academy was beautiful!
The ground was soft and sticky. And out of it, soap bubbles blew out of the ground.
"So cool. C'est belle." Sakura sighed in awe of the supernatural phenomenon.

Meanwhile, a group of kidnappers crept up slowly behind her.
"You think that this will be worth much in the human store?"
"Seems so. Do you see that shape she has and those boobs?"
Sakura blushed slightly at their remark. Yes, they whispered but she heard them. She knew they were behind her and that they were going to try and take her away to be sold.
Like she she was ever going to let that happen.
She continued walking along like she didn't hear them. The kidnappers, seeing this as their chance leaped towards her. As they came closer, Sakura watched them fiercely then jumped away. They cursed under their breath but Sakura couldn't hear that. It was too muffled.  They then rushed towards her with their weapons.
Sakura just continued to look at them until she jumped and firmly planted her foot on one of the kidnapper's faces. A gush of air circled them.
Sakura:  Sky Pulse.
She said and the kidnapper was sent flying. The other one merely watched with a shocked expression.
"She's a devil fruit user?" One of them exclaimed in pure shock. Sakura merely smirked, "So what?"
"Ga, I better run." the kidnapper finally said before leaving. Sakura smiled at herself. That's the first time she has actually defended herself and not get beaten up. She felt proud.
"Wow, you're gotten stronger a lot stronger since the last time I saw you." a familiar masculine voice said. Sakura turned around and her smile grew brighter and bigger.

"Ace!"
