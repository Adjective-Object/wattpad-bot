"Leena, don't do this to yourself, you have to eat", "Simon, I told you 5 times that I'm not hungry" I turned my face away, Simon brought a plate full of food with a spoon on top of it, "Remember when you fed me cake? Not it's my turn, open your mouth" He put the spoon on my lips but I kept them shut, "EAT" He shouted, "Shut up, go away my aunts are coming" I shooed him, "No, I'm not moving until you eat, now put this in your mouth", "No", "Eat", "No", I Said EAT", "Go away my aunts are about to reach this floor", "Not before you
Eat this" Simon raised an eyebrow, "You haven't eaten since the first day", "Okay, fine,  just leave" I pulled the plate from his hand  and started eating, "Now go" I said, "Not before you finish this" He said, my aunts came and caught him sitting on the floor in front of me, Simon coughed and stood up, I rubbed my face and sighed because I knew I was about to get a long lecture from my aunts. They asked me about him and where did he come from, Zainab and Amal were sweating, I told them that he was a friend of Karam's,  Karam came and changed the subject because if  those two aunts get in an argument, it ends with a huge rumor and Scandal.
Karam took Simon and went outside.
Zainab and Amal woke me up, the lawyer had arrived. I wore dark clothes and went downstairs, the brothers and sisters for my parents were all sitting in the living room, passing smiles and envy looks, I noticed Karam sitting beside Simon looking sad and disappointed, I sat on a chair, and the lawyer started talking, as soon as he did, my relatives started arguing, one of them wanted the house,
The other one wanted to have the Ferrari, an aunt wanted mom's golden bracelets, I was staring at them like a deaf man in a party, I didn't know where all of those things come from, I didn't even know how did we buy this mansion. When I left, we were rich, but we lived in a big house and had two cars, now I'm in a mansion with a garage full of cars .... How, Why and When?
Simon and I made eye contact, he didn't understand what was going on, but he felt how disturbed and angry I was.
I asked if I could talk to the lawyer in private, My uncles rejected, they said it wasn't Okay for a man and a woman to stay alone, I said that I was going to take Karam with me, they all glared at him.
Me and Karam got out of the room with the lawyer after 2 hours, I was completely shocked after what I had heard, my relatives were still arguing, Simon was looking at them and trying to understand a word they were saying. Their head turned to my, Karam's and the lawyer's direction, they drew fake smiles of their fake faces, I told them to go home, I wasn't ready to discuss anything, many of them protested saying that they had the right to take their share of money immediately, we got into a huge fight, the lawyer told them everything, men should take 2 millions, women should have one million, aunts and uncles should have and part of the companies my father had, they all gasped at the huge amount of money their luck gave to them, I stood up and suggested something, I offered to buy their parts of everything,  I wanted to have the companies and properties instead of money, so I was going to pay 25 millions to all my uncles and 12.5 to my aunts, they immediately agreed, Karam got into a fight with me, I told him to shut up and stay away from my decision, Karam slapped me hard on the cheek, Simon caught him and my relatives protected me, of course they would ... I was like a bank to them, I asked the lawyer for the papers, he had every paper that was needed, all of my relatives signed without reading a thing, they gave up all the properties for cash money. My uncles and aunts left to their houses with few millions in their bank accounts.
Karam stayed and we got into another fight, Simon caught him, "What's wrong man ?" Simon asked,  "THIS IS THE DUMBEST GIRLS I'VE EVER SEEN, She paid more than 10 million dollars for each person that was here" Karam said, "ARE YOU CRAZY?" Simon screamed, "What were you thinking?" Zainab said angrily, I stood in my place, smirking, "Do you think I'm crazy ?" I asked, "YES" They all screamed, "I spoke to the lawyer, Karam wasn't listening, I bought their parts of the companies and everything,  in a year, those companies will give me money 10 times more than the money I paid today. Karam, you are the only one that I didn't buy his parts, because I want you to control everything, I want you to run everything for me, I'm not stupid to let everything my father worked hard for just go easily and get into their filthy hands and hungry tummies. And by the time they realize that,  they'll come back begging me to give them their parts back, but it will be too late because they've already signed the legal papers. I called the lawyer yesterday and he told me about this great plan, he was my father's friend".
