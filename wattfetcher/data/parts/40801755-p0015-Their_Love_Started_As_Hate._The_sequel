I ran down the last couple of stairs leaving my suitcase behind, "James," I shouted and jumped into his arms, "Emily, I missed you," he mumbled through a mouthful of my hair, he set am down and kissed my cheek, "areYou ready to hit the road,"
I nodded and pulled my suitcase down the last stairs, "I'll take that my darling," I smiled at his nickname for me, he always called me that, "thanks,"
I walked over to my aunt Jen and gave her my key, I could feel marks, eyes burning into the side of me, my aunt Jen wrapped me up in a bear hug, "drive safely honey bun," James walked back in and grabbed my waist after my aunt Jen let go of me,
"Your a sweetie for picking her up James," she smiled, he returned the gesture and I felt his lips brush my ear, "is he the one that hurt you?" I nodded slightly, gulping and looking down at my shoes, I was handing the key back over because my aunt Jen said she didn't need it and, she had to change xanders nappy, I felt hands I my waist and then I was turned, I sent James giving me a play-along look, he leaned forward and placed his soft lips on mine,
It's been a while since if felt those lips on mine, I didn't think he was going to take it further, so when I was of guard he slipped his tongue in, they fought for dominance, and I one, smiling at my victory, there was a clearing of a throat which mad me pull away from James, I blushed a little,
"Maybe you'd should leave, get some dinner on the way home," Mark said glaring at James, he walked away and ran his hand though his hair.

"She is such a bitch," Rose said going through my closet, "how did she get so popular?" She questioned, i laughed, "from fucking every popular boy in our school," it was her time to laugh
She paused, "do you think she has done it with; Mark?" I sighed they could have, that's a low stoop though, I don't think he would go that low do you? Wait I'm asking myself, "I don't I know," I mumbled, "so this James guy," Catherine butted in wiggling her eyebrows suggestively, I rolled my eyes,
"We dated when we were like 16, he just helped me out, we are friends, nothing more, nothing less," "ohh, how about this, she said holding up a full outfit, she was asked on a date and came to borrow my clothes because apparently they are better,
"Its perfect," I smiled, "your only going to the movies, I it was me I'd be going in leggings and a crop top," Catherine laughed, "so what are we wearing tomorrow clothes wise?" I said jumping of my bed, "something that will make us prettier than the ugly beasts at school," Rose said seriously, I laughed at her seriousness,
"Okay let's get picking," I walked into my closet, the girls were rummaging through racks of tops and dresses, when my phone started ringing, I looked at the caller ID, hm, why would James be calling me, he made it clear he had no feelings for me after the kiss, although I kind of wish he did, I picked up the phone and said hello,
There was no answer, "James?" "She's so sexy, and the way her lips moved against mine, made me want her even more," James said, "man, your lucky to even know the girl Mark is a douch to even cheat on a girl like Emily," an unfamiliar voice said, "I told her I didn't have feelings for her because that would just be awkward, we dated like 3 years ago and I was the one to break up,"
James butt Dailed me, I couldn't help the smile forming, "for god sake Jackson what have I done," I heard James groan, I wonder what he's like in bed, ew Emily stop, I sighed and hung up, no use keeping that going even though, I liked it, its not like I'd date him again, "girls have you found anything?" I asked walking into the closet that looked like a natural disaster happened in it.
