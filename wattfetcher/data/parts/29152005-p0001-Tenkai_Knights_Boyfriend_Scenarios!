You walked home from school alone, hoping not to expect to be called to Quarton once more, you already had to sneak out of class once, but due to your parents being famous for an awesome clothing store in the Benham City mall, you got off the hook. As you walk home, you heard familiar voices coming from in front of you. Of course... Granox and Slyger, you betrayed Vilius years ago, bot he still wanted your Tenkai hide.
"Well well well, look who it is." Slyger said.
"What do you want?? How many times do I have to tell you to lea..." You were interuppted by a voice you recognized too easily.
"Hey Granox! Slyger!!" The voice yelled.
You looked in the direction the voice was coming from. You couldn't believe your eyes. It was Guren Nash.
"Leave her be!
"She's a tratior!! Granox yelled charging at them.
"Oh no you don't!!" you yelled. You pulled your portal device and your (f/c) corebrick and slid it into the compartment that held your corebrick in and pressed the button sending them both Quarton.
"Whoa! How did you do that? I thought the Portal Device only worked on one of them." said Guren.
"I tinker with stuff like this... my mom works with your dad." I said.
"Oh... what's your name?" He asked.
"(Y/n), on Quarton (y/tenkai name)." You said.
"Guren, on Quarton, Bravenwolf."
