I pulled into her driveway and carried her out of the car with her wrapping her legs around my waist. Sometimes I think she's mentally challenged. I marched up the stairs to her room. I tried setting her on the bed, but she refused to release her legs around me. I tried prying them off, but that didn't do anything. She obviously doesn't miss leg day.
Finally she fell off of me when she saw a sparkly thing in the corner of her bedroom. She scrambled up off the floor and tripped her way over to the shimmery thing. It was a toy crown she must of had when she was like five.
She jammed it on her head trying to make it fit. It was obviously for a four year old. She walked over finally getting the stupid crown on her head and shouted with delight "Colton loooook ima princessssss." "Lovely." I replied.
"Greta I need you to go to sleep now." I said softly. "But I'm not tireddd." she whined. "Greta please." I begged her. "Ok ok ok ok." she sighed pushing her hand on my mouth and than stated "You talk to much." I glared at her and pointed to her bed. She frowned and marched over there.
"Coltooooon can you ssssleeeeep with meeee. Pweasssse." She pouted giving me puppy eyes. She got me. I couldn't say no to her. I got under the blankets and held her close to my chest. She was already drifting off.
I heard her stir a little and say again "Colton can I have a baby now?" I smiled "Greta maybe some other time." "Mkay." She mumbled. I slowly drifted off to sleep as well.
