"The feels are real." I say quietly, "What?" He asks, I chuckle "Nothing." I said, Cameron starts playing music, I spin around on Sammy's said wiping whip cream on his face. I chuckle and he laughs wiping the cream on my cheek.
We finished the gingerbread house, mom put the gingerbread man in the oven. I let it cool off, "Where's my water?" Sammy asked, "In my belly." I chuckled lifting up my shirt a little showing my belly, "Zayum." he chuckled.
Mom soon walks in, "Mom can I get a belly piercing?" I asked her she turns around slowly, "Now why would I let you do that?" She asks, I start to laugh, "Ah ha your funny, I'm serious." I said, "I am too." she chuckled, "Please!" I begged her.
"I don't know I'll have to think about it." She told me, I nod. "I'm tired." I said, Sammy nodded and I lay on his chest, he picks me up and carries me in my room, I look on my bed and it was Jake sleeping.
I chuckled and I laid him in his bed, "Goodnight." I mumble, Sammy laid his head on my chest and I rubbed his head. "Goodnight." he said, I cut off the lights and fall asleep after Jake moves next to me.
