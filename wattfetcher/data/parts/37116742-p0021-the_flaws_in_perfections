baby I can feel it we've grown apart by the day darling can you see it we've gotten colder with the distance
I thought you would be different we don't mean it it isn't different this time around
all the little things you said the meaningless words stories you filled me with
I did what I had to do I feel you leaving now I see your bible and your gun it's all over now
