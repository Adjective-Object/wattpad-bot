Hi, my name is y/n l/n. And this is my life. Its pretty shitty and not very exciting but its.. different.. Anyways. My mum is an alcoholic and my dad beats us. My little sister Addilen is never hit or gets things thrown at her. Shes daddys princess. My mum, Aubrey, gives my dad drugs so he doesn't beather. I sure as hell aint gonna give him my dope! Me and Addie go to the library to escape the loudness and arguing in the house. I pull down my sleeves so Addie doesn't have to see the scars and cuts I've done. she doesn't need to see more then she already has.. I'm constantly being beaten at home and school. I  bring my headphones to the library so I can watch youtube. Amazingphil, danisnotonfire, immature, cryotic, pewdiepie.. are all reasons im still alive other then Addie. "Are we gonna go to vidcon?" Addie says, snapping me out of my thoughts. I write, "I don't think dad wants you to go, I would be in so much trouble just going myself. plus I don't have enough for the both of us." I lied. I don't talk either.  I haven't said a peep since I was seven. that was 5 years ago..

So how was that? I actually got better at writing! Its amazing!.. like phil.. I-Im sorry.. im obsessed with him and dan right now.. theyre the only things making me not cry.. so tell me how it was? I LOVE YOU!!
remember..
don't cry.
