I: Hey do you want something from the store?
A: You're playing games and need something to chew.
I: I just asked if you wanted something from the store?
A: You're super hungry so what do I do?
I: Okay, i've had enough of you texting me song lyrics.
A: My mind is like a puzzle or a Rubix's cube, but figuring me out something you shouldn't do.
I: Anthony, I just wanted to know if you wanted anything from the fucking store.
A: Because my thoughts are locked inside a padded room and if these padded walls could talk we'd certainly be doomed.
I: Are you done yet?
A: Say my name and his in the same breath. I dare you to say they taste the same.
I: I'll take that as a no.
A: Let the leaves fall off in the summer and let December glow in flames.
I: If I sing along, will you stop?
A: Erase myself and let go. Start it over again in Mexico.
I: I'm just going to let you get this out of your system.
A: But that's no fun.
I: GOOD! YOU'RE DONE! now what do you want from the store?
A: These friends, they don't love you. They just love hotel suits, now.
I: Anthony Padilla, tell me what the fuck you want from the god damn store!
A: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK AS LONG AS IT'S ABOUT ME!!!
I: .......
A: I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of words.
I: If you don't tell me what you want i'm leaving and taking Luna with me.
A: Can you get me some fruits to make smoothies?
I: Okay. Love you :*
A: Love you too :*
A: And don't really care which side wins as long as the room keeps singing that's the business i'm in, yeah.
I: I'm leaving. Byeeeeee
