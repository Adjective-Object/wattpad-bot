River:"River?! What the fuck is wrong with you?!" I stopped and looked to see Corey and Kiefer. I know Corey said it. I stood up and Kiefer walked up to me.
"River, you know what's going to happen. Right?" He said. I nodded and I saw Corey grabbed Mallory's waist and arms as she struggled to get out of his grip.
"Good." Kiefer smirked and pushed me onto the grass. I felt my arms being grabbed and my head was tugged up by Kiefer's strong hand. "Corey, let me go!" I heard Mallory scream and I saw her back kick Corey in the leg.
She got out of his grip and she got on top of Kiefer trying to grab his hands. Kiefer then punched me. "Kiefer stop! Please!" She screamed. I saw her grabbed by Corey and Wil. Kiefer punched me again as I groaned in pain.
"River!" She screamed as she was kicking her legs, but they had a hard grip on her. Everything was blurry with tears...my tears. Kiefer punched me one more time before getting off of me. I turned onto my back and they let Mallory go.
Mallory:I ran up to River and cupped his face. His head was bleeding. I cried and he cupped my face. He wiped my tears away and I kissed him.
"No, Mallory!" Corey shouted picking me up by my shoulder. "Stay away from him or I swear to God I will hurt you more!" Corey shouted. I yanked my arm back but he slapped me.
I can't take it anymore. I tackled him. I tackled Corey. I punched him until he flipped us over and straddled me. He held my arms down with one hand and punched me with other as Wil watched, smirking.
Corey got off me and I gasped for air. Corey towered over me and pulled me up to my feet. I watched them all walk off as I helped River to the nurse's office. "Thanks." He whispered.
"You're welcome." I replied and we went to the nurse's office.
