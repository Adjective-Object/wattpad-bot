I got my phone out and and put my earphones in and listen to one of my favorite songs(Austin Mahone-Places). After the song ended and replayed over and over again, and I put my head on the window and fell asleep. ----***~~~~~~~~~~••••••
I woke up and looked at the window and saw that I was at the airport and I also realized that I was now listening to (Shawn Mendes-Show you)which is also one of my favorite songs.I got out the bus and walked into the airport and was lookin for the station to go to LA. I finally found it and walked over there and took my earphones off my ears started talkin to the lady"I'm guessing your here to go LA aren't u?"She asked"Yeah"How old are you?"How old are u?"She asked"16"U look kind older like about-"She said before I cut her off"18,21, yeah I get that a lot"It was quiey for a little while and she was typing something on the computer"Its booked"Great just Great"I was about to turn around she say something"But we do have a room in First class"Great I'll do that"Ok"She gave me the ticket, and I walked into the plane and gave a lady my ticket and lead me towards an opened seat.I put me bags in that thing where u put your luggage at I sat down. I waited about 10 minutes until the lady said thay we are about to be im the air. I got so nervous bc I've actually never been on a plane before, but I can gey through this. I was inhaling and exhaling to calm myself down until a person that sat by me that looked so familiar."I'm guessing that this is your first time on a plane"That obvious?"Don't worry, plane flights aren't as bad as u think they are"We stood there in a awkward silence until he asked me something"I'm just wondering but how old are you?"Im 16 but I'm almost about to turn 17 in 3 months"Wow u look kind of older"Yeah I get that a lot"I chuckled"Oh sorry I forgot me name is Jesse Adams"I'm Cameron Dallas"I knew it, I was wondering why u look so familiar"He chuckled"So u heard of me"Yeah, your vines are hilarious"He laughed"So are you here by yourself?"I asked him"Yeah, I was visting an old friend of mine"Oh, yeah I completely forgot that u lived in LA now"He chuckled. I didn't realize that his eyes were similar to mine but I think his was prettier than mine"Are u mixed?"He asked out of curiosity"Yeah, my mom is black and my dad(Bastard)is white "Cool..... why did u call your dad a bastard?"Crap I must've been thinking out loud"Its a long story and a bad one"And I'm also part Indian, you can probably tell by my black hair"Yeah I can see it"Do u have any siblings?"Nope I'm the only child""Cool"But if u was wondering I'm kind of spoild"Oh ok"We sat their in silence for a while, I looked out the window and realize that we were in the air"Wow, the sky from up here is amazing"Yeah, hey Jesse I was wondering are u-"I cut him off bc I know what he was going to say."Gay?, no.. but I'm actually bisexual"Cool, and how long have u been..bisexual?"I think maybe 2 years and yes my mom knows if u were wondering"He chuckled "What?"Just funny how u know exactly what I'm going to say"Oh"I chuckled.I can't belive I'm actually talkin to him, but at least I'm not one of those fan girls that scream and cry and sometimes a little bit of both which is kind of aggravating"The screaming and crying is the good part"Crap I was thinking a loud again "Sorry, I mean I understand why, but they just doing a little too much...It just gives me a headache"Dont u do the same?" "Me?, no.. I mean I get excited but not all crazy"It was quiet again for 2 minutes until the lady told us that we have 10 hours until we arrive in LA"I almost forgot to tell u, why are u going to LA?"He asked"Well my mom moved to LA, but I wantes to stay in Louisiana so I've been living with my Aunt for 5 months until my mom called and said that she found a place for the both of us, and I said yes and now that's were I'm headed"Wow"I know"I this sound all classic or whatever but what your favorite color(s)?"Red and Blue"Good choice of colors"Why thank u"I chuckled" hey,Jes do want to make a vine with me?"Sure I guess but I kind of have a little stage fright"Oh I understand"But we can do it"He had a big smile his face, it is so pretty which is weird sort of. He got his phone out got on Vine put on the video thing"Ready?"Ready."Hey guys would like ya'll to meet my new friend Jesse"Hey"I said(I was so nervous)"I just got back from Louisiana and heading my way back to LA, so I see u guys later"He ended the video and put it on Vine"I dont know how u do it but that actually kind of fun"I had a little pratice" "A little, mors like a lot"He laughed "What?"Nothing just that your an amazing and cool person"I chuckled"So are u"(I think I just saw Cameron blush) "Cameron Dallas, did I just made u blush?"His cheeks was getting red. I was laughing and then I turned around and looked through the window and saw that it was dark oustide."Well its getting late"I said"Yeah, do u have a blanket?Yeah I do actually".I told him to get up so that I can get the blanket out of my bag.He pushed back so that he can get out of the way, and I'm pretty sure that he lookin at my butt. I got blanket went back to my seat and put the cover over me until I saw that Cameron was shivering so I gave him some of the blanket.I tilted me head to the window before I went to sleep I saw cameron was scooting over so that he can get close to me, and I went to sleep.
