I keep thinking, 'It's all going to end anyways, so what's the point?'
But then I picture your star drunk
Eyes resting upon mine in the moonlight.
I don't understand what deemed
Me fit to witness the beautiful depths
Of those eyes.
And if I'm looking to resist
The things I'm feeling, i will never come out victorious,
For these feelings are feelings
That demand and scream
To be felt.
