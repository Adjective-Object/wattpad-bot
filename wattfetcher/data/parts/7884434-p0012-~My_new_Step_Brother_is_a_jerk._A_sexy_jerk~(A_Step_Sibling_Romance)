"You like that Seth?" I asked suductivly.
"Fuck yes I do!" He said grabbing my hips and rubbing them softly. "I know you wanted me Shea" I let out a laugh and he looked at me confused.
"Sorry. We gotta get back to Lisa" With that I pryed his arms off of me and and ran back to the front of the parlor. I see Lisa sitting there talking to a boy that looked her age. She was smiling and he was smiling back. AWE!
"Lisa who is this?" I said walking over to them.
"Oh uh hey Shea! This is Benji! We are in the same class"
"Hello Benji!" I said holding out my hand. He smiled up at me and shook my hand.
"Where is Seth?" I laughed to myself
"He has a tummy ache he might be a while" I went into my pocket and pulled out a 20. "Here you and Beji go play mini golf. I'll wait for Seth" I said with a smile.
"Okay! Thanks Shea!" Her and Benji got up and walked out walking next door to the mini golf course. A couple minutes later Seth walked out and saw me sitting there by myslef.
"Where is Lisa!" He demanded
"Relax she is next door with a boy she likes. She is fine!" I said with a smile.
"Are you crazy!? A boy? Hell no!" He started walking outside when I grabbed his hand. He turned and looked at our conjoined hands and smiled softly. "Seriously more teasing?" He asked with a smirk.
"I grabbed your hand not your dick" I laughed.
"You could do that too" He said pulling me into him.
"Seth stop, we are not a couple. I don't want any cute guys walking by and thinking i'm taken" I said with a wink. He just frowned. And let me go. I laughed and pulle dhim back in a hug. "I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings" I laughed
"I am still hurt but the hug helps. Maybe a kiss with make it all better?" He asked hopefully
"Nope not a chance." I let go of him and made my way out side. As we walked out Lisa and Benji where finishing up.
"Lisa! C'mon we have to leave!" Seth yelled making Lisa jump. She looked up a blush on her cheeks. She looked down and finished puting her ball in the hole.
When she was done she hugged Benji and made her way over to us.
"Thanks for paying Shea! I had a good time!" She said with a smile.
"No problem Lisa! Did you get his number?!" I asked her with a grin
"Shea!!!! No. Okay yes I did!" She started smiling like crazy.
"Awe!!! Lisa has a crush!!!!" I said nudging her.
"Shut up! Do you blame me? He's a babe!" She said with a laugh. Seth made a gagging noise and me and Lisa laughed harder.
"Seth! Shut up! Your the one with a crush on our new almost st-" Seth covered her mouth and smiled at me. Whe he thought she wouldn't say anything else he uncovered her mouth. "Step sister!" She finished which made Seth turn extreamily red! Awe he's so cute when he blushes!.
"Lisa no I don't! She's not even my type! I prefer blonde!"
"Mhm sure so thats why you guys where locking lips in Sheas room!" She laughed. I stopped and so did Seth. "Don't worry I won't tell Dad and your mom. I like Shea! I want her to stay and plus you guys make a cute couple!" She laughed and got in the back seat. I looked over at Seth and he looked as shocked as I did.
