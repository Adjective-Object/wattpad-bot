"WOULD THE TWO OF YOU SHUT THE FLUFF UP!!!!! I'M TRYING TO THINK AND HERE YOU COME RUDELY CRASH LANDING AND ACTING LIKE IDIOTS! APOLOGIZE!"

"Sorry, Aya." Haruka apologized, his entire face black.
"I'm not sorry." Marco whispered, all he got was a huge bump on his eye.

"What did you say!"
"I said I'm sorry."
"Sorry won't cut it Marco!"

After a few minutes.....

"MARCO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE! HARUKA, WHY DID YOU BRING MARCO HERE!" Aya shouted, anime tears running down her cheeks and she was shaking poor Haruka's deformed body.

"I'h dwdnr't hw cimw on hwe oyh akkorde."
^^"I didn't. he came on his own accord."

Aya dropped him and sighed. She sighed again and this time it was louder.

"I didn't come on my own accord. Oyaji sent me." Marco answered, dusting himself.

"Eh? Whitebeard sent you!"

"I always knew my life would end this way." Haruka stated, bowing on the ground with depressed lines emitting from his body.
"Yeah, life was good while it lasted." Aya cried in the same position as Haruka.

"Guys, he will not kill you but you broke a law. You went out on a job without a senior student."

"I knew something was wrong!"
"Now, I have to talk with the one who received the request."

At that moment, Sakura came back with Millie and if looks could kill, Sakura would be dead by the glares they sent her.

"You idiot!"
"Bitchy Lizard, why the fuck did you sign our death certificates with Whitebeard?"

-_-" --> "What the hell do you mean?"


"Eh? Whitebeard is the principal of the school?" Sakura exclaimed as nobody had told her this fact.

"Why did they send me here? I've literally dug my own grave." Sakura cried with the same depressed lines. Haruka and Aya joined her too.

And they all sighed, "Life was good while it lasted."

"WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP THAT! HE WON'T KILL Y'ALL YOI!"

Millie finally looked up from the funny scene and looked at the strange man in her ballroom.

"Who's that pineapple?" She asked, pointing to Marco.
