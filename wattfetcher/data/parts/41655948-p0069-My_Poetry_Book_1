"A life lived for art is never a life wasted" - Macklemore
This quote is constantly running through my head. It's from the song Ten Thousand Hours, look it up it's amazing. But anyways, this quote just speaks to me. It reminds me that although it's unstable and sounds crazy, I should live my life for art because art is amazing and it means I'm doing something with my life, and that I've got the courage enough to chase my dreams. Don't give up on your dreams, your dreams are everything. You may not see it now but every hour of work you put into your dreams will help. It's a long journey to get there but as they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the ride there. Whatever you do with your life, make sure you're happy and that your dreams are still a part of your life. I love you guys.
