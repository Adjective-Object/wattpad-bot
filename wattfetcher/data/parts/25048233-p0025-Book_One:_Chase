"Did you know I was a very shy guy back then? I can't hold conversations as long as three minutes. Everything starts to get awkward and people usually hate that."
"Ha! I never knew. I mean, you look so friendly right now!"
"Yeah. I owe it to this special someone who changed me. I met this person when I was a freshman. Ahh, memories."
"Oh, that's sweet! So... where is this special someone now?"
"That person is here..."
"Here? Working with you?"
"No..." He paused. "In my heart, you silly!"
"Ah! I figured. Haha."
"So..."
"So... what?"
"I announce this day as our first official date!"
"..." Not you too, Art!
"I'm just kidding!" He smiled again. "You better head home now or it will be too dangerous later."
"Yeah. Thanks Art."
"Anytime!"

A/N:
I feel I have a lot of explaining to do. But first, let me apologize to the avid readers and fans of this series. I know I have disappointed most of you and I promise to not do it again.
I've been "soul-searching" for the past few months and I've finally moved on. I had this pretty bad break-up which made me unable to do a lot of things. I focused too much on trying to heal my broken heart that I forgot I had you guys. It's a long story but yeah, I'm back!
If you still want to read my stories, then please feel free to support. I will not leave you guys again. Expect to have updates every week!
Thank you for understanding. <3
