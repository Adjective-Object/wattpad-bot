The light and the dark pack lived together in harmony once before joined together by the guardian's that protected them.  The guardians were formed by the earth's peace. The more hatred there was, the more the guardian's fought.  The belonging's of the packs started disappearing.  Each pack thought the other pack took them, but they didn't. The pack's rage grew and grew the more stuff disapeared. The guardian's anger grew with the packs until they could not take it.  They fought and fought until their lives were gone.  With matched power there was no telling who would would win.  They fought until they were dead, until they both fell and were illuminated to the stars. The packs eventually separated and split into two separate packs.

The Pack  Light: The light pack made sure they stayed far away from the Dark Pack, since they weren't together anymore more. A She-Wolf ran into the leader, Fang's, den. Fang looked at her fiercely, "What is it now Clover!" He asked with a snarl.  Clover breathed heavily trying to catch her breathe, "The Dark Pack, they're back!" Clover looked up at Fang worried.  Then Fang turned around staring at Clover with a shocked look, "WHAT!!?" He said angrily.  Then all of the sudden a whining from outside Fangs den was heard. They both looked at the entrance only to see a shadow of a wolf being slayed by another.  Clover ran outside to see  two Dark Pack wolves taking over. The two Dark Pack wolves looked at clover and ran away.  Clover watched in fear and then turned to the survivors left in their pack.

Clover turned around and ran to Fang, the leaders, den.  Clover looked at Fang, "The Dark Pack...they.....they attacked...there are very few survivors" She said in fear.  Fang looked at clover and growled, "THIS CAN NOT GO UNPUNISHED BRING ME OUR BEST WARRIORS!" He growled, "they will pay for what they have done"
