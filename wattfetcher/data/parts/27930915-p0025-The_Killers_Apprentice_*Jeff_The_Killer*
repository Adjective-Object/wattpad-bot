"Sorry.. sorry.." I apologize while still laughing. She just shakes her head as our laughter dies down.
"You're stupid." She tells me.
"You're stupid." I turn her insult on her like a third grader.
She surprises me by crashing her lips into mine. I don't know what to do, so I just stand there until she stops. We both look at eachother for a moment.
"So I'm gonna pack the body up and plant it.." I say awkwardly.
"Yeah. I'll leave you be." She scratches the back of her head and exits the room.
Shit, Jeff. I'm such an idiot. I should have kissed back. I should have said something.
I'm so fucking stupid.
Lena's POV
Why.Why.Why did I do that.
"Lena! I'm hungry!" I hear Wyatt as he tugs on my arm. I sigh. "Take something from the fridge. I'm not in the mood right now." I say to him.
"Wow, what crawled up your butt?" He asks, offended.
"Nothing. I'm sorry just could you.. could you please?" I ask him.
He looks confused, but then hugs me tightly. "I'm sorry you're sad." He says into my stomach. I tense up, but then accept the hug and stroke his head.
"I'm fine." I smile at him.
I hear dragging coming from the hallway. Jeff comes out with a giant bag on his shoulder, clearly the body.
"You're leaving now?" I ask Jeff.
"I'll be back in a few hours." He tells me. "Will you be okay?"
"Yeah, I'll be fine." I nod. "I'll miss you." I tell him, instantly regretting it.
He kisses my forehead, confusing the hell out of me. He's not affectionate what the hell?
"I'll miss you too but I won't be that long." He deep voice assures me.
"Okay, see you later?" I ask him.
"Later." He nods and exits.
"Well that was dramatic, he's coming back in a couple hours." Wyatt crosses his arms.
"You booger."
