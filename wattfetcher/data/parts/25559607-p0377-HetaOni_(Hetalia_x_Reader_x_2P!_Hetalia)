I looked around the room. Every possible place that someone could hide in was searched...but no (Name).



"Where...did she go...?"

The eerie silence of the halls made me feel uncomfortable, so I decided to just head back to the room where I was supposed to stay at.


On my way there, so many thoughts ran through my mind. Where did (Name) go? Who was that guy who looked a lot like Luciano? ...Why am I...even here?


The last question made my head ache the most. I still have no clear idea about it. All I know are from the things my friends have told me. I have no...memories of my own.


I opened the door where I knew there would be scary monsters kept in a cell. When I entered the room, the creatures were still there. They were creepy, possibly dangerous, and scared me shitless when I saw them earlier.


But oddly, I don't feel anything about it anymore. I mean, I'm aware that they could harm me, but I actually feel quite confident that they won't be able to get me since they're trapped there. Still...


Still... I find it weird...that I'm looking at it now as if it's a normal thing to me. This is just the...second time I've seen those monsters, right? It feels so strange. Maybe I was ridiculously brave and I just don't remember? Maybe... Maybe...not?...


Shrugging, I climbed up the rope that led up to the door up on the ceiling. Once I was up, I tried to take a moment to listen to my surroundings. I could hear my friends talking loudly about something. They most likely have not taken notice that I left. "Good." I sighed in relief.


I untied the rope from the metal bar and closed the door. I placed back the rope to where the little girl found it and headed back to my room.


"I don't fucking care! You know you have to explain, so explain everything already!" I heard someone shout from the other room. I recognised the voice, it was Allen's. Wow, they must be in some kind of quarrel right now.
