Hey readers! Okay so i've written a few stories before but i never tried to upload one online so this is my first time! I didnt want to upload it until i found a title (yes im VERY indecisive)but my friend convinced me to put it up anyway because its such a great book. (her words not mine. i think its okay and that it could be better.....) So what i decided to do was to put up the book and ask my readers to give me their opinion on the best title. so far i have a few, and i will list them here and i will add whicever titles i like from your suggestions. As i continue to upload, if you guys would please give me suggestions for the title, i would appreciate it so much! All the way at the end, i will give my readers a chance to vote on their favorite. Thanks so much!
Heres what i have so far:
1. Hidden Secrets2. The Footsteps to Freedom3. Finding Your Way4. Struggling For Survival 5. Holding on to Life6. Two Worlds Collide
