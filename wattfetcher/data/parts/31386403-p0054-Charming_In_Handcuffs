I nodded in agreement. "Me too."
Meredith stood up off my bed and headed to the door, "By the way, I know you aren't sick." She smiled and winked before walking out my door. I had to smile to myself as well. She probably thinks that I faked it to stay home with James all day. And part of me wishes that's what I would've done.

I was sleeping so well when the loud crackling of lightning struck and woke me up. Several claps of thunder followed the boisterous noise, making it impossible to go back to sleep.
In a sleepy haze, I looked at my bedside table to read the time. It was a little past three in the morning.
I got out of bed and walked to my window to close the curtains.
But before I could close them, something caught my eye.
I tall figure, standing below my window. I know it couldn't be Jack because of the line of string. The figure stood on my side of it.
My heart was racing and I couldn't look away.
A flash of lightning illuminated the face for only a second.
I waited for another flash of lightning, and when it came, the person was gone. The sight of white hair was etched into my mind, willing me away from sleep.

Hope you like the chapter! :)
