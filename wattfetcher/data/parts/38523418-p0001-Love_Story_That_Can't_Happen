Hi I am Katie McArdle I am 18 turning 19 soon. Well I just graduated high school. A little more about me. Well I have brown hair with blonde highlights. I have a brother named Matt McArdle and he is 19 almost 2o. I live in West Fargo and I live right next to a really cute hockey player who plays for the team in my town. He is the same age as me. He has blonde with a little bit of brown hair. He is really cute but I don't think he knows I exist.
