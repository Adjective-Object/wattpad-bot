"Fuck. Are you sure this is your first time?" Johnny moaned. I could only moan in reply. Soon I came, screaming Johnny's name. Johnny followed soon after me. We laid there panting. "Damn. I don't believe you've never done that before. You're too good for that to be your first time." Johnny said. He pulled out of me. I laid there trying to catch my breath. I watched as Johnny went into our bathroom. I smirked when I realized he was mine. And I was his. Johnny walked back out and saw me staring. "See something you like?" He joked. I smiled and shrugged.

"Maybe. Come over here and I'll let you know." I said.

"Yes ma'am." Johnny said and stood between my legs. I smiled up at him and beckoned him closer. Johnny obeyed and I kissed him.

"Thank you." I whispered against his lips.

"For what?" Johnny asked. I ran my hand down his chest and smiled as I felt Johnny shiver.

"For everything. I love you." I said. I yawned. Looking at the clock, I saw it was past midnight.

"I love you too. Let's tie me up another time. We should sleep now." Johnny said and pulled the blankets around us. He pulled me against his chest and wrapped his arms protectively around me. I drifted off to sleep shortly after to the sound of Johnny softly singing. I barely recognized the song in my tired state. It was what I like about you. I fell asleep with a smile on my face.
