Poseidon gave us a little smile before snapping his fingers. I was pulled into a vortex with Percy beside me and the marbles placed in the box in my hands.
My necklace slapped again my face. My insides were going to be my outsides if that hadn't stopped then and there.
Just as I was about to black out from the pressure, there was a loud crack after which I was shot u in the sky.
I let out a scream as I dove into the lake of Camp Half-Blood. Seems like I wasn't the only one as I could hear Percy's yells from beside me.
The water inched closer until I was a mere meter away from the surface.
Just then a jet of clear, sparkling lake water shot out of the sky and grabbed my waist as well as Percy's as though it were a hand.
The water rushed towards the shore at a speed that I wouldn't have known to exist.
Just as we were about to slam into the shore the water let go of it's grip. Percy and I went face first into the sandy beach of a shore shot before skidding and rolling to  halt.
I need to go to sleep now, I thought before going to sleep at the spot.
