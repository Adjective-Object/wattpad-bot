Lilli's POV
OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! Aureylian and Captainsparklez are sitting right across the playground!
"Oh my god." I said as I started to cry tears of joy.
"Hi, what's up?" Jordan asked. AHH! JORDAN ACTUALLY TALKED TO ME IN PERSON!
"Oh my god." I said is I fell to my knees balling my eyes out in tears of joy.
"Are you ok?" Aurey said as she knelt down and put her hand on my shoulder. I hugged her and cried.
"I'm guessing you know us from YouTube." Jordan asked. I nodded yes.
"Hi." I possibly questioned.
"Hi, what's your name?" Aurey asked me.
"I'm Lilli." I said once I calmed down and took a breath.
"Hi, Lilli." Jordan said.
"Oh my god." I said as I hugged them both.
"Mommy!" Boo cried, Aurey ran to the slide where Boo had fallen.
"Oh my god!" I said as I cried again. Jordan hugged me to try and calm me down but it made me cry more.
I saw Aurey coming over holding Boo.
"She fell, do you have a band aid?" She asked Jordan.
"Oh. Boo, you okay? He asked. She reached out for him and he took her as Aurey got a band aid from her purse.
"Oh my god." I whispered to my self.
"Sorry about that, Lilli. Do you want a picture?" Aurey asked.
"Umm, oh my god. Sure, sounds -- oh my god -- sounds good." I said.
"Cool. Do you have a phone or your mom?" Jordan asked.
"Oh, MOM!" I screamed as I ran back to our table.
"She's cute." I heard Aurey say when I was on my way back to there table.
"Oh... my god! How did I not see your arm?" I asked.
"Oh yeah, I got dizzy and fell." She said.
"Wait dizzy? I thought you slipped or tripped or something. You didn't say you were dizzy. I would have been more worried if you said you were dizzy, Erin! I could have helped you walk to the car." Jordan said.
"Yeah, it doesn't matter. Well picture time?" She asked changing the subject quickly.
That's weird, she was dizzy? I wonder why, and why did it sound like he saw it happen? Was he there?
"Yeah, okay." I smiled. We took the picture and that was that. As I walked away, Erin sighed loudly.
