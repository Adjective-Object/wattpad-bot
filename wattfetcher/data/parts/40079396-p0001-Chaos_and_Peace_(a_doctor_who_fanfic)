Of course they say I'm weird...thats all they do....they always call me a freak. I hate it! A sound of metal. another. another. At least I have a window.
"Lily Hello!" A lady said as she entered my room. the rooms were small at the orphanage. I was more worried about how she knew my name. "Oh, um, hello." Is what I said to reply, she told me her name was Jane."What is that sound?" She asked. "Hm, oh, it sounded like metal." I told her. "But why?" I shrugged "How should I know?" "What is your guess" "I mean we could look out the window but I don't know if I want to..." then she looked out the window. "I can't see outside. its to dark." I brought out a laptop from under my pillow "I mean....i was able to sneak a laptop...maybe I can hack the light systems." "um okay." Is how she replied. I was about to except another person appears out of thin air. Literally. "hey what's with the lights?" He asks "hold on" Then he closed his eyes and pointed at the lights. Seconds later they turn on. "Well, that worked better than I thought it would." Then they started having a conversation about things called Weeping Angels and Daleks. After a little while I take a sonic screwdriver out of my jacket "Still haven't returned this..." She looked at me "Oh who gave it to you?" And she laughed a little. "Oh, um, someone called Grace." I told her." Then a noise that I finally understood. The T.A.R.D.I.S! A white door appeared and Grace fell out "My sonic, why...did you have it...IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT FOR SO LONG. Do you know how hard it is to find something in the T.A.R.D.I.S?" I nodded "You left it here a month ago." "I can't believe I left it with a six year old...." lIve been meaning to give it back I just haven't seen you." I handed the sonic back "now could someone look outside?" "Why?" Grace asked. "Metal noises is why" Jane then looked outside. And starts dragging me away. I was able to get out of her grip while Grace asked if we should go in the T.A.R.D.I.S. We got in and flew away. eventually I forgot.
