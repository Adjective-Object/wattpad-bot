When I was A young boy
((Lies I am a girl))
My father took me into the city
((I live in the city ._.))
To see a marching band
((Nope he doesn't like that stuff))
He said
"Son when you grow up will you be the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned, will you defeat them, your demons and all the non believers."
((Thats way too deep for my dad))
