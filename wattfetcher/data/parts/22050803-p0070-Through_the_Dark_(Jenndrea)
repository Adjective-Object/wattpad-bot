"Oh, God. Cool it, Patrick. Don't bring that back up, it was years ago." Her dad nodded. "Anyway... Have you, you know, talked to Mom since I left?"
He rapidly shook his head. "I didn't even know you left until you showed up here today. Does it look like she wants to tell me anything? I'm an asshole, Jennifer, and so is she."
"That's where you get it from!" Andrea exclaimed excitedly. Jenn and her dad glared at her.
"Why didn't you ever check on me? Give me some vague sign that you knew you remembered my existence?" Jenn inquired.
"I had no reason to. You're a decent kid, you'd make it somewhere, whatever."
"But I didn't! You could've at least called to ask me how I felt -- I could've used that. I didn't make it anywhere. I'm just living across the country now with other people who have lives, and all I do is sit around the house and fuck my girlfriend. That's not a life, Dad." Andrea blushed.
Her father shrugged. "Are you happy with it?"
"It's fine, I guess." A silence rose over them. "I'm just like you and I don't want to be. You hurt Mom, and I don't want to do that to Andrea."
He scooted forward in the chair, placing his elbow on his knee. "Parents try to make their kids better than they are. I didn't spend enough time around you to do that. Now, I'm sure your mother spent the last eighteen years teaching you to hate me."
"And?"
"You're nothing like me. Now go, your mom probably misses you."
Jenn got up, pulling Andrea up with her. She headed for the door, opening it and allowing Andrea to go through first. "Wait, one last thing."
"Yes?"
"Can I borrow your car?"
