We have faced many casualties, but for now we have won.	Swiping my sweaty brow, I look at Orion, who is still in his wolf form. Next to him, Dawn glances at me the looks towards all the corpses, finally settling her gaze on Alpheus. I nod in reply and walk over to where he lies.
"Today," I start, "we have lost a very respected and brilliant man." The other Lupis bow their head in respect.
I continue.	"Alpheus was a great man, of great status and of kind heart. He leaves behind sorrowful hearts and a poor widow whom we shall care for." At this Alpheus' mate, Nara, lets out a choked sob and drops to her knees.
"In two days' time, our nation will hold a memorial funeral for all the brave men and women who risked their lives and happiness to protect us." I form my right thumb, index finger, and middle finger into a circle and stick my ring finger and pinky together, using it to slide diagonally down from my left shoulder to my chest, then sliding it straight down to my stomach and placing my knuckles across my forehead so it looks as if I am saluting with two fingers. The Orinus farewell.
"Thank you good men. We will never forget you."
I lost my parents thirteen years ago. I will not lose anymore loved ones.
