I am not wholeI am brokenPieces of me are in everyoneLike shrapnelI was a bombSwift but deadlyI ruined many livesWith a snap of my fingers they vanishedI will never be wholeYou cannot rebuild meI have no drive to liveNo need to functionI am simply dead And I shall let it consume me piece by broken piece
