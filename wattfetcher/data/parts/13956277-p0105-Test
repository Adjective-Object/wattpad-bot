"WHAT ! WHAT'S GOING ON !" I shouted at Damon, "Sit down and calm down" He said, "Dont tell me to calm down when you scare me and freak me out like you did on the phone" I said, "Listen, this is not easy to explain" He started walking in circles, "SIT DOWN AND SPIT IT OUT", "You need to get back to your country"He sighed, "Did you freak me out and bring me from my work to tell me to go back to my country? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU", "Your parents are not fine" My eyes shot open, "What?", "They had an accident few days ago, I thought they'll get better but they didn't", "What ! How did you know ! What happened" I tried to hold back my tears, "Calm down. Remember when your father knew that you're living here and was about to force you to get back, I called him and spoke to him, he didn't agree to let you stay at first, but, I offered something" Damon took a deep breath, "What did you offer ?" I sniffed, "I ... I told him that I'll stalk you and tell him about anything and everything you'll do and that I'll protect you from everything, Like a bodyguard, he agreed and said he'll give me 500 dollars a month. But I swear I didn't do it for the money, I did it just to let you stay because you loved it here", "You've got to be kidding me, you WHAT !", "Just please listen, I did it, I told him about everything, and how you defended yourself and how strong you were and great at school, that's why your parents didn't call you many times, they were so proud of you. Then one day, I called your father and he was driving, I told him that I'll call him again later but he insisted and put the phone on speaker, your mother was sitting beside him. Jealousy hit me hard when I felt you getting close to Simon, I told your father everything about Simon and that you became friends with him and told him that you went to the park with Simon *sighs* your father got angry and he started shouting and scolding me for not stopping you then  ... he crashed into something and I lost the connection, I called again after an hour and a nurse answered, I didn't understand what she said at first then she spoke to me in English and she told me they hit a bus then a huge tree, she said they weren't really fine, many bones got broken, I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you this earlier, I thought they'll be fine soon, but I called today and the nurse said they're getting worse a-" I jumped at him amd cut him off, I started punching his face with all the fors I had, "HOW COULD YOU ! YOU IDIOT ! IT'S ALL YOUR FALT" I shouted at him while my tears and fists were falling on his face, "Leena stop" Simon came in and pulled me away from Damon, "Let her get everything out, It's Okay I deserve it" Damon said, "GO AWAY ! ITS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU, EVERYTHING HAPPENED WAS BEAUSE OF BOTH OF YOU" I screamed while crying and punching Simon's chest, "I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU, I HOPE YOU DIE" I sobbed and kept punching Simon's chest, Damon was wiping his bleeding nose, while Simon stood still in his place looking at me with caring eyes, I kicked him and punched him until I was tired, he didn't say a word, "GO AWAY, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, SCREW YOU, IT ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOU, I TOLD YOU TO GO AWAY BUT YOU DIDNT LISTEN, NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED, MY PARENTS ARE DYING AND IM THE LAST ONE TO KNOW, I HATE YOOOUUUUU" I punched him one more time, then suddenly, he pulled me into a tight hug and rested my head on his chest, "LET ME GO" I punched him one more time before I surrendered and hugged him back, his shirt got wet, "Shhhh, everything will be fine, calm down" He whispered in my ear while holding me tighter, he lifted my chin up, "Look at me. NOW, we'll back our bags, get two tickets and get you back to Jordan to see your parents, everything is gonna be Okay" I pulled away and looked at him.
