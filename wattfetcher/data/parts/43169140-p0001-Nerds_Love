Blah blah blah introduction and crap I would tell you about my life but it's all shit.
Whatever I'm dating this asshole named Brady and your probably asking why not break up? Haha, not that easy as I wish, If I did, he would beat me up.
Yes my own boyfriend would beat me up, did I mention he was an asshole?
Anyways I act like I don't even give a shit around him I just go with it and compliment him.
And he is coming up to me right now in the school hallway looking really hot I gotta say.
"Hey babe, wanna watch my football game after school?"
"Uh sure I guess." then I fucking faked smiled, ugh I hate this.
"You guess? Amber, you need to understand this is my life, you HAVE to be there."
Yeah? And what if I don't show up? What If something important in MY life comes up, huh? I wanted to say that so bad.
"I know sweetie." then I put my hand through his hair and fucking fake smiled again!
It was later on, now in science the last 8th period. I was put together with a nerd for my partner, and he wasn't ugly like many, many, many, many others. He was actually really nice, I have no idea what his name was but, if he got me an A+ in this class, that's good enough for me.
We we're about to mix some shit when he asked "do you like to skate?"
Skate? I love to skate but I had no idea, a nerd would like skating.
"Actually yes I love skating."
"Really?" He looked like he just solved a world hunger. "Would you like to skate with me after school today?"
Me? Well I would but, I have to be... ugh DAMNIT ugh I hate this life I have to fucking life dating Brady.
