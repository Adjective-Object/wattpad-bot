Ever wonder what its like to be loved my by someone or love someone? Yeah me too but I know I will never know. Relationships for me have never turned out great. I think relationships never turn out good for me because I don't believe in love. Love has many consequences that I'm just not ready for. Love is hard to control and someone always ends up being betrayed or hurt. I am just not ready to be responsible for breaking someone else's heart.
I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Faith Carter, people call me many names like Faithy or Faithers. I am a junior at Jefferson High school and live with my mom and older sister in West Virginia. My parents split up after I was born, but I still have a close relationship with both of them. I have a pretty good and normal life besides my slight obsession with Ariana Grande.
One day I want to be able to know what this thing people call love is but I'm just scared of the outcome. How will I know if it's really love? How will I know if he feels the same way? How will I know if he is "My Everything"?-----------------------------------------------------------Sorry for the short chapter I just wanted to introduce one of the main characters.
P.SCameron will be coming really soon and and the chapters will be longer!
