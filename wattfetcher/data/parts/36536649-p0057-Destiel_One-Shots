"Dean, let's sit out here. In the garden?" Cas suggested and Dean nodded his head.
Mary Winchester's garden was beautiful, and the boys only sat out there for serious talks.
"What is it, Cas?" Dean asked as they walked past Mary's yellow roses with red tips.
"You know, Dean, yellow roses mean friendship, but yellow roses with red tips signify friendship and falling in love."
"Okay," Dean chuckled.
"So, Dean," Cas began, but decided to do this in a better way. He went to the rose bush and snapped off a red-tipped yellow rose.
"Cas?"
"Dean..." Cas cut himself off and placed his lips on Dean's.
Dean mouth was warm and wet and perfect and - just so... Dean.
Not to mention Dean tasted like cherry pie.
And they kissed and kissed and kissed themselves breathless.
They ignored the muffled "TWENTY BUCKS, SAMSQUATCH, RIGHT HERE" coming from inside.
And all Cas could think was this feels right.
