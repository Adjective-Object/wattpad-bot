"Dean!" Castiel shouted, finally seeing his husband after the third day. He crashed his lips into Dean's.
They were in a car accident. Going south down the interstate when a drunk woman hit them head-on. Cas was mostly fine, just a broken wrist. Dean had been unresponsive for a while, but now, he was up. He was up, he was mostly fine, and that's all that mattered.

Cas eventually pulled away, but only because the other man wasn't kissing back.
When he looked at his husband's face, it was blank and confused.
"Dean?" Castiel whispered.
"Who... who are you?"
