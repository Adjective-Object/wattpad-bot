"I went on a run to clear my mind..." I informed him. I walked over to my charger and plugged in my phone.
"Oh Robin, I'm so sorry. It's my fault, I told mom that you might need someone to talk to about your mom's death. I'm sorry." He informed me. I just looked at him.
"You should have asked me first, if that's what I wanted..." I told him.
"I know and for that I'm truly sorry, but I can't get you out of out it."I looked at him as he walked up to me. Wrapping his arms around me, he said.
"I'll always be here for you." After a bit of hugging he let go and looked at me.
"Now come on, we need to go counseling..." he told me with a sad smile....
