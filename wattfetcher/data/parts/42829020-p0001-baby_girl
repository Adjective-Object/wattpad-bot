How many times have you said I love you in your life? I bet you've said it many times for many reasons and to many different people. But have you ever really meant it? Have you ever found that sensation of love? I know I have but have you? What is my idea of love you ask? The firs thing when I think of love that comes to my mind is my boyfriend of 5 years , Daniel Veda.
