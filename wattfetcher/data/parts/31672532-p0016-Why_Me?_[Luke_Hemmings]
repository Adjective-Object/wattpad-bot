"Please? You can trust me." I did trust him, but I hate telling people what's wrong because I feel like such a burden on them.
"Fine. I finally called Sarah and she almost hung up on me and so I told her what was on my mind about her ignoring me and never talking to me and she flipped out and said that I'm not her friend anymore and blocked my number. So I just layed on the floor for about an hour and cried and blah blah blah." I could feel the tears behind my eyes fighting to be free, the one slipped out and I lost it. I just broke down and cried in front of Luke, but felt no shame. I held my knees to my chest and my head buried in between. I then felt something wrap around me and hold me close, it was Luke. He was so warm and cuddly, I unraveled and hugged Luke tight and cried on his shoulder. He hugged me tighter and whispered in my ear it'll be okay, I promise. I never felt so close to a guy like this before, yeah I had a boyfriend before but we never really did this kind of stuff. Luke was sometimes quiet and would be awkward but when he has something to say, he would tell you. Taken out of my thoughts, Luke pulled away to see my face and whipped away tears that were on my cheeks.
