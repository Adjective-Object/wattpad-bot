I was shot in the chest, and I remember every second of it.

The boy behind the gun stared at me, his gaze level, and his breath steady. He isn't afraid to kill me. Why? What have I done? Who is he?
Deep brown eyes blink right before his pointer finger draws inward. I expect to be terrified. To be moving, quickly, attacking.
After all, isn't that what a human would have done? And why am I not scared?
Because I trust him. The person behind the weapon is a friend. I never thought this would happen, and I'm still in shock. Looking down at my chest, I see the blood spurting from my wound. I'll be dead in a minute.
How does that song go again?

Before it gets better;
The darkness gets bigger;
The person that you'd take a bullet for
is behind the trigger.

My gaze turns from my chest up to the boy again. But the young man is gone, and in his place, gun still firmly leveled at me, is a girl. She looks to be around sixteen, with a calm face, black hair, and startling emerald green eyes. She looks so familiar.
And as I watch her, I fall. The first bullet has done its work. I stare up at her with unblinking eyes-I'm helpless in my situation.
And I very well should be. She won't let me go until I figure out why I'm here. She shoots me again, even though she doesn't need to, and she knows it.
Then I remember where I've seen her. Of course, her hair is different now-it's snow white, stripped of its color. But her face is mostly the same-and I would know, of course.
I see her in the mirror every day.
