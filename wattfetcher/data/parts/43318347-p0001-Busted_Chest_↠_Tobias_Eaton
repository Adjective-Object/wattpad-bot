I DO NOT OWN DIVERGENT OR ANY OF IT'S PLOT LINES. I DO, HOWEVER, OWN VIENNA QUIIN AND HER PLOT LINES WITHIN THE BOOK.
SO, I'VE BEEN EXCITED FOR THIS FOR A WHILE. I DECIDED INSTEAD OF DOING TEEN WOLF FANFICTION, I'LL JUST MAKE OTHER FANFICTIONS FOR OTHER FANDOMS. SO, HERE'S WHERE DIVERGENT COMES IN.
ALSO, VIENNA TAKES OVER TRIS'S ROLE IN THE SERIES OF THE BOOKS. SO TRIS ISN'T EVEN A REAL PERSON, SHE DOESN'T EXISTS. TRIS'S STORY IS PRETTY MUCH VIENNA'S STORY WITH TOBIAS/FOUR.
PLEASE, DONT FRET. I'LL STILL UPDATE BROKEN LUNGS REGULARLY, BEING I HAVE THE REAL BOOK FOR BOTH OF THE STORIES ON MY PROFILE, SO THEY'LL GET UPDATED REGULARLY.
