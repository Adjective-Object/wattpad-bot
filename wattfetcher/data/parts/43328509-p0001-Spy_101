Have you ever killed a man? Have you ever felt the rush of blood when you pull the trigger? Have you ever experienced the after effect when you feel invincible? I have. I've felt the blood, I've felt the deadliest felling, the felling of ultimate power. The felling that you are in control of if they live or die. In my case, it's my job. At this exact second you may ask yourself is she mental. No. I am a spy, you know the cool ones of TV, yeah that's real. Right now though, I'm not very gamorous. I'm sitting in a bra and thong, dry humping an old guy. His eyes have rolled back and im unbuttoning his shirt. In a few minutes when I turn around he will be dead. He didn't pay 350 dollars for nothing. He moaned. "Fuck me baby," he grabs my hips and spins he around. I can feel his full erection on my thigh. I pull his trousers down and sit on it causing him to moan and lay his head back. "Show me a good time," he grinned. As he was doing this, i reached up and pulled out my gun from my angle wings. He stopped and looked up. "Baby baby, is a toy," he kissed the gun. "Listen up Thomas Epizare, my name is Laura Mendze and I mean business, I'm not s hooker." He looked at me. His polish accent kicking in. "Laura Mendza, I heard this name before, I think," he grabbed my hips. I pressed the gun to his chin as he drew back. "Why not kill me Laura Mendza?" He looked at me, with his big eyes. "Where are the girls and the money, Mr. Epizare," I said trying to contain my temper, I tapped the gun in the side of his skull. "Baby I don't..." He didn't get to finish before I shot him. And then the effect kicked in, the power. I pulled myself off him, pushing by boobs up, returning the gun to my wings. I pulled back the curtain and walked away. There was nothing I could do now. He was died. I am Laura Mendza and I am a killer.
