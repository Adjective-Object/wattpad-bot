*ARABELLA POV*
When I woke up the next morning I went down stairs to go see if Cam was up.
Let's just be aware I was in a tank top and spandex.
I walked down the stairs to see cam with two other guys. They had the brightest blue eyes oh my god I was amazed.
The younger looking one said, "Take a picture. It'll last longer."
I laughed and noticed he was staring at my legs.
"Take a picture. It'll last longer." I said and winked.
He turned a bright shade of pink as I laughed and Cam looked some what mad. Clenched jaw and all.
"Geez cam. What's your problem?" I asked and he just glared at me.
"Seriously, do you need a tampon? 'Cause I have some upstairs if you need." I said trying my best to keep a straight face which was really easy since I did it a lot.
He glared at me again and I just sighed walking upstairs.
I went into my bathroom and searched through my drawer and once I found it I went downstairs.
I walked up to Cam looking up at him with a really serious face and handed him the tampon.
"Remember to change it regularly." I said and he looked at me strange.
"You are one weird child.." he said while trying not to laugh.
"Umm I think we all already know that, Cam."
We all just stared at each other for a minute then we burst out into laughter.
"Go get your bikinis on! we're going swimming!" Cam said imitating a white girl voice.
I just laughed and went upstairs. I went threw my drawers until I found my swim-suit. I put on the mint green bandeau and mint green bottoms, grabbed my phone and towel, put on my flip flops, and went downstairs.
Everyone  was already down there ready to swim and we headed to the beach.
