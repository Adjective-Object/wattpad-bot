"So what's your name?" the new kid asked me politely. His voice was rough and sort scratchy, but still had that high pitched male adolescent sound to it.
A girl a couple tables ahead turned around, "Don't bother talking to her, she's just a mute freak," she said rudely, I hung my head even lower.
"Piss off," the guy muttered, making me look up in shock, "I never liked people like you and I never will. Besides, if she's mute, how do you know she's a freak? Have you ever talked to her?"
The popular chick stared ahead in shock, just as surprised as me. "Her mom was a freak, so she is too. It's just logic, raised by a witch, you are one. And just look at her, she practically screams freak."
I put my head down again. She was right, I was a freak. Or at least looked like one. My hair was long and wavy, reaching the small of my back. It started off red at the roots, them lower down faded to brown, then orange, blonde, and at the tips white. The freaky part: it was all natural. And that wasn't the only thing, my eyes. My eyes were a daaaark grey, speckled with other luminescent shades of blue. Salt and pepper, but with grey and blue.
The joke almost made me smile. Almost. "So what if she looks different? I think it looks cool, and that doesn't even matter. I hate to sound like a cat poster, but it's whats inside that counts," the boy argued, seemingly growing madder.
He turned away from the girl as she huffed  and turned back to her group of  popular people. Probably to tell them to get me back later. And to shun the new kid until he got the message and started hating me.
"Well  I'm Moxie, I know, girl name, but people just called me Foxy at my old place, cuz of the red hair," the boy said. He paused for a moment, seemingly thinking, "Hey," he said, "why don't you write down your name if you can't talk?!" He seemed exited, and I didn't want to tell him that I chose not to talk. I nodded and pulled a piece of paper out of one of my binders.

Proxis
I can talk, I choose not to.

Foxy looked at me oddly.

Everyone here shuns me, it'd make no difference if I talked.

"I'm sure that's not true," Foxy said, astonished.

I was raised by the town freak, and I got her burden when she died.

Foxy gave me another odd look. Confused but... Hopeful? Weird... The bell rung to interrupt my thoughts, and I quickly gathered my stuff for first period. "See you later," Foxy said, the odd look gone and replaced with a warm smile. I nodded at him and he let out a small laugh, still laughing as I walked out the door.
