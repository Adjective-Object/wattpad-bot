Tony smiled, "Joe had to use the restroom." He said motioning to the bus driver, "And when he smelled the bathroom he said he's stopping at the next gas station and I knew there was a reason I liked him."
"Well it'll be nice to stretch and I could use a monster."
"Did you fix everything with Kellin?" Jaime asked and I nodded.
"Yeah I did and speaking of that I might need to tell him why we stopped."
"Probably be a good idea." I nodded and went back to the bunks where Kellin was on his phone.
"Hey we're at a gas station come on." I said.
"Okay." He said and stood up.
"You want anything to drink? My treat." I asked as we headed out of the bus.
"No thank you, I'm alright."
"You sure?" I asked.
"Yeah, I'm alright."
"Alright well I'm getting a monster." I told him as we walked inside.
"You do that."
"I will thank you." I said sticking my tongue out at him as I went to grab two monsters. One for now and another for later.
"Hey why did the buses all stop?" Austin asked me walking up holding Alan's hand.
"Joe and Tony had to pee."
"Jaime?"
I nodded, "Yes him."
"Whats going on here?" Kellin asked gesturing between the two.
Alan started to blush, "Oh well ya know we uh we're dating." He stammered.
"Oh really?"
"Yeah." He said smiling.
I looked over at Austin and smirked, "Thought you weren't a relationship kind of guy?"
"Things change Vic, people change." He said.
"Uh huh." I said still smirking. "Well Kellin what do you say we leave these two lovebirds alone and go back to the bus."
"Sounds good, Alan, you and I are talking later." He said to him.
"You got it Kells."
"Oh and Austin- I have my eyes on you." He threatened glaring at the taller guy.
"What? Why?"
"Because you're dating my best friend and he's a delicate little flower and you better treat him like one."
"Delicate little flower?" Alan said, "Since when am I delicate little flower?"
"Since I said you are." Kellin said and Alan glared.
"Shut up and go make out with Vic."
He rolled his eyes. "Why does everyone keep saying that!"
"Let's just go to the bus." I said blushing a little. Is it that obvious?
"Gladly. See you guys at the venue!"
"Yeah, later." Austin called while Alan glared.
"Am I really a delicate flower?" Alan asked as we walked away.
"I thought that picture was photoshopped." Kellin said as we walked back.
"What picture?" I asked confused.
"You haven't seen it?" He asked pulling his phone out, "Someone took this of them kissing yesterday. I thought it was photoshopped or something."
