Aubrees POVI love surprises but this one was in expected.
Cam pulled out the ring. Oh my god was this happening?
He pulled it out and asked me,
"Aubree, will you marry me?"
"Oh my god yes!!" I screamed.
He pulled me over and kissed me. We went to the bathroom to get ready and he just smiled for the longest time at me. I could tell he was excited.
Once we were ready he sat down on the couch and pulled out his computer and got on the internet to make reservations for our wedding. We had it scheduled for June 16th at the Scotrade Center and our reception would be at Busch Stadium.
This would be the best wedding ever.
Cam started making invitations on Shutterfly. I got out a list and started naming people to invite. My list Sandra PettyBella DickeyAva EdenSophia HortonJessica Hulsey Shelea FischbeckDora The Explorer Kameron House Addisyn Casey Etc.
I made my list and Cameron made his list.
Cameron asked me who he could invite. "Hey sweetie, umm can I invite Hayes and Nash."
"Who's that?" I asked
"Really-"
"I'm just kidding and you invite whoever you want" I said.
"Ok thanks." He said
I looked over his shoulder and I saw he was looking at having the reception on the field or in the clubhouse."I think we should have it on the field cause it's bigger." I told him.
"Ya that makes since." He told me.
He made the reservations and the wedding. I started to make dinner but I realized we didn't have any food. Well forget that. I told Cameron and he went to the grocery store and bought a cheese and bacon pizza back.
I put it in the oven and waited 10-13 minutes for it to bake. I took it out and slices it up and we ate it. I out the left overs in the refrigerator for tomorrow.
I woke up and I relived it was the first day of June. We still had 15 more days. So we went dress and tuxedo shopping today.
