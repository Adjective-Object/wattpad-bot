"Nope we're in a new place and we're going to explore it."
He sighed, "But I don't want to."
"Too bad, let's go get coffee or something." I said and grabbed his hand.
"Fine." He grumbled.
"Good now go get some shoes on." I told him.
He groaned getting up and walking off before coming back with shoes on. "Lets go."
"Great," I said. "Let's go."
He nodded, "Fine lets go do some exploring."
"You need to stop being a fuddy duddy and get happy. I'm supposed to be the moody asshole not you." I told him poking his cheek.
"Don't." He said smacking my hand away.
"Don't what?"
"Don't poke me."
"Why?" I asked and poked him again.
"Because I'll break your fucking arm. I am not in the mood."
"I think you need a hug." I told him.
"No."
I gasped, "You're saying no to a hug? What has the world come to?!"
His eyes narrowed, "I don't want a hug. Deal with it."
"I think I'm going to hug you anyways." I said wrapping my arms around him.
"Vic let me go."
"No, not until you accept it."
"Accept what?"
"This hug."
"I'm not accepting it." He muttered refusing to hug me back.
I pulled him closer and smiled not letting go, "I guess we're just going to be standing here all day." I sighed resting my chin on his shoulder.
"Vic!"
"Kellin!"
"Let go of me!"
"Nope."
"This is uncomfortable." He whined.
"Too bad, I'm not letting go until you hug me back."
He groaned once more before giving in and hugging me back.
I smiled, "Now was that so hard?"
"Very."
"Well then fine- I won't hug you ever again." I said pouting and pulled away from him.
"No! Don't not ever hug me again. That's unfair."
"Well you didn't like the hug so I guess I'm just not going to hug you anymore."
"I love your hugs."
"Well it didn't seem like it now come on, let's go get some coffee or something." I told him.
"Sounds good to me."
I nodded and the two of us started walking around town in search for a coffee shop when Kellin finally found one.
"How about Caribou?"  He said looking at some coffee shop.
I nodded and grabbed his hand pulling him along into the coffee shop.
"Let me pay," He said as I handed the money to the cashier.
"You're not paying, I refuse to let you pay for anything." I told him.
