On the Sea-Train.....
"Why do you get motion sickness?" Sakura asked the suffering pinkette.
"Its a pretty dumbass reason." Haruka hissed earning him a very weak slap from Aya.
Next stop. Candy Island.
"You hear that Aya, the train will stop in a few minutes." Sakura spoke soothingly to the sick girl. She merely nodded.
Then the train stopped.
"I'm alive!" Aya exclaimed with her wings popping out.
"Whatever. Let's just do this fucking job." Haruka hissed. Then Aya slapped him.
"Have a better atti-."
They were amazed by the sight of the island. The sky was tainted in a pinkish-orange and were filled with cotton candy as clouds. The very grass before hem was made of candy and the trees were made of candy canes and the lakes were made of chocolate.
The houses were made of gingerbread and frosting. In the fields, for example, they grew candy apples and sweet popcorn. To all candy lovers, this place was paradise.
"Peppermints!" Sakura exclaimed sparkling and drooling.
"Chocolate!" Haruka followed having the same expression.
"Licorice!" Aya followed. Afterwards, they went off in a candied frenzy. Sakura found herself ontop a peppermint tree already having eaten half its bark. Haruka literally bathed in the chocolate lake. Literally. Aya well almost destroyed a farmer's income.
"Welcome to Candy Island." a pink haired princess greeted only to find no one there. She was sure that they were coming on the 3:00 train.
(Picture is Princess Twilight.)
"Princess-sama, I'm so glad you're here." a random farmer called.
"What is it?" The princess asked sweetly. Sweetly enough to make the man stop dead in this tracks.
"There are three savages loose on the island and they are eating all the candy! Oh, and one is bathing in the choclate lake." He reported.
"Eh? Bathing in the lake?"
A few unfortunate minutes later...
A loud scream was heard in all of the Candy Island which was given by no other but the Princess.
"You pervert! Don't go bathing in an open lake!" Sakura scolded already beating Haruka to a pulp.
"Princess-sama, are you alright?" Aya asked the shivering princess.
"He..He..He..He was.."
Going back in time, a few minutes earlier...
"Ah, that was a nice bath." Haruka sighed standing up. The steam from the warm chocolate greatly exaggerated and magnified all the perfect curves and muscles on his already perfect nude body.
The Princess coming to inspect on the claim made by the former and just happened to see Haruka at that moment. Hearing her, he merely turned her head being completely oblivous to the obivous fact.
The Princess was suffering from a disease commonly known as 'Seeing-a-guy-in-the-nude-and-my-precious-innocence-taken-away.
Back into the future....
"Princess-sama, I'm so sorry for my friend's idiocy. It won't happen again." Aya apologized, once again beating Haruka to an evener bigger pulp.
"So what's the job about?" Sakura asked her mouth still filled with candy canes.
