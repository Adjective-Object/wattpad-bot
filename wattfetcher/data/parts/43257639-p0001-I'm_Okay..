AN: As I said in the discription, this story is based on a complicated relationship. The characters will be described later on, but the two main characters for now is, Maria House (Mary) and Christopher James (Chris). Mary has a beautiful long brunette hair, with grey eyes, pale skin. She's bout 5'4". While, Chris has dark brown hair, with blue eyes, fair skin and his height is 5'9".
Chapter 1.It all begins with this one call Mary gets a week before schools are opening.."Mhm.. Ahaan.. Okay.. Great, thanks for calling Mr. Lee.",  Mary said with excitement. Her mom staring at her weirdly, as if she has seen The Vamps new music video. "What's the excitement about, hun?" She asked confusedly. Mary explained about how she applied to get into this school she always wanted to go. As they shifted to Beverly Hills, she was applying for this high school since months. Her mom was happy for her and they both decided to go outside for dinner.
.."Your order, please" asked the waiter. "I'd like to have fish and chips with lemonade drink." Mary said while smiling at the waiter. "And what about you ma'am?" He asked Mrs. House. "I'll have the same thing, Thankyou."
(Mary)Later on, I began to look around the restaurant, I caught a glimpse of a guy starring at me. But, I looked away and didn't bother much. As soon as me and my mom were done with the food. She paid the bill, and I gave the waiter a tip. Because he was charming and his smile kind off wooed me. While we were leaving the restaurant, I looked at that guy again, who was still starring at me. I decided to go and talk to him, but my mom called me, and then I forgot about it even.
Furthermore, me and my mom went for shopping, I shopped from Forever 21 and mom bought some new trainer shoes from nike. While I was leaving the mall, I saw that guy again. This time, I went up to him and asked what his problem was. He showed me my phone, and I began searching my purse. "Oh, I must've dropped it off while entering the restaurant. Thankyou so much." I looked at him, this time it was up close, he has dark brown hair, blue eyes, and he's kind off taller than I am, I take it as if he's around 5'8" or 5'9". With his sexy voice, he said, "You're welcome, be careful next time." I smiled at him and said, "I'm Mary" I shook my hands with him. "I'm Chris".
