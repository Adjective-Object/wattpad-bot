Jessica arrives at the apartment building. She enters and runs upstairs to her floor. She knocks on marks door. It opens and mark looks at Jessica."Jessica what's wrong,and what happened to your face?" He said as he  examined the hand print from where she got smacked."I got smacked by a guy named Danny at work." She said as tears began rolling down her cheeks."It's ok, shh,shh,its  ok, markimoo is here." He says hugging Jessica trying to calm her.He lets her in and both sit on the couch. He was still holding her,calming her. She never felt llike this before. So safe,so secure,so loved. Mark pulls out of the hug and looks at her face. Wiping tears away from her face."I know what will make you feel better!" Mark says. He stands up and runs up stairs. A few seconds later mark comes downstairs with a pink fake mustache and a pink cape on."Super mark is here to help a damsel in distress!" Mark says while he stands in a funny super man like pose.Jessica smiles at marks goofyness. She decided to play along."Oh, save me super mark!" She says like a distressed person."I'm here m'lady, what is thou problem?" He says as he puts Jessica's hand palm down with his."I was smacked by an evil goblin, but luckily I hasth given thine ass to goblin when I punched him in the nose." She says laughing."Show the lady like a kiss on the cheeck?" He asked"I would love one please."Mark kisses Jessica on the cheek.He was right Jessica was feeling better. They both laugh then watch TV. She never felt so happy before,she liked the feeling of being happy.
