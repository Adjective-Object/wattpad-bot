" I gotta go check on my girlfriend " I said getting and grabbing cookies and ice cream and a water then I paid  for it
" bye  justin " she yelled  out smiling
" bye amber "  I called out and returned the smile then rushed to Kylie's side I ran back to her room  to see her mom in tears then my heart dropped as I seen my mom give me a  concerned look then I saw  docters  rushing in and out Kylie's room  and then the door slammed shut and  all I heard was the beep of  a machine then I saw docters walk out with there heads hanging low and the left the  door open  I walked in the room and  dropped to my knees  kylie  was laying there motionless not one movement  and   I just cried out right there I couldn't lose her not now not ever  then  ran to her side and pulled her in my arms and sat down in the floor with her and gently stroked her hair then softly pecked her lips
" baby please wake up " I cried in her neck  and I stayed like that for a long time  then Kylie's dad walked in the
"morgue is here to take her body and ready it for the funeral"
" why she's not dead she's just sleeping " I cried   stroking her hair " she's gonna wake up she has to " I added
" she's not waking up she's dead "  he said
" they aren't taking my baby shes not dead she's just sleeping she will wake up you'll see" I  told him still stroking her hair
" justin she's dead she's not gonna wake up " my mom said coming in the room
" no mom she's just sleeping" I said pulling her closer to me
