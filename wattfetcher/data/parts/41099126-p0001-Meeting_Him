Chapter 1: Moving to Texas
*Morgans POV*
Hi I'm Morgan Stewart! I am 13 years old and I am moving to Texas. Right now I live in North Carolina....it sucks. Anyways my mom is making me move because I have had so much drama going on at my last school. But the thing is, is that I have to make new friends and that is kinda hard for me to do. I hope I make good ones. We are leaving tomorrow. We are driving all the way there and I'm gonna be on my phone listening to music the whole way there. Right now it is 9:05 pm, did I mention that I'm famous. I have a lot of followers on Instagram, Twitter, and lots more social media. Do you know this app called YouNow? Well I broadcast on that. I have amazing supporters. I love all of them. I am about to tweet something so haha lets go tweet something I guess.
" Hey guys! If you live in Austin Texas, I will moving there tomorrow. So I am going to be having a Meet 'n' Greet soon!"
*Next Day*
Today is the day we are moving, I'm excited but then I'm not. I know this kid on younow called "BruhItsZach" and I also have his number. He is really funny and I am hoping that I can live near him so me and him can collab. All of a sudden I hear a ding go off on my phone. Speaking of Zach, he just went live on YouNow. So I go to his broadcast and all I see is people commenting "Did you know Morgan is moving to Austin Texas" I'm thinking why are they saying that. So zach reads the comments and he says "Ohh she is. She cute tho. Do yall want a youtube video with her in it with me?" Everyone starts to type "Yes". I started to blush because I've always wanted to make a youtube video with him. I'm so excited. 5 minutes later my mom tells me to get in the car so we can head off to Texas.
*5 Hours Later*
We arrived at our new house. It's beautiful and right beside it is a house that I recognize. I think that is Zachs house. So me and my mom go next door and knock on the door. Then the door opens.
*Zachs POV*
Who is here. Ok guys lets go see who it is. Do yall want me to turn the camera? Ok I will. I open the door and its a girl I recognize. All the comments say "Its Morgan!" MORGAN! What are you doing here?
*Morgans POV*
Omg I was right it was Zachs house. He opens the door. He says hi. I am your neighbor (laughing face). Zachs says "No way, thats cool. Say hi to the broadcast." I say "Hey guys!" Then my mom walks away back to the house. So um I will talk to you later. k? I say. Zach says "Or you can come in and be in the boradcast with me if you want." I say "Sure I would love too". All the comments start to say that they ship us. Some say that me and zach are their favorite younowers and now they are together. I start to giggle and say "Seriously me and Zach, its more like Zach and Corisha" Me and Zach both laugh. I see Corisha comment " Awe thanks Morgan" I say ur welcome back. So me and Zach just talked for like 45 minutes on broadcast and then after that I told him that I should be home to unpack my stuff. So I hugged him and said goodbye.

*Next Day* *Zach's POV*
I  can't believe that Morgan moved right next door to me. Me and her both do YouNow and stuff.....that is pretty cool. I know my supporters don't want me to have a girlfriend but I think ive might of found one. But I need to get to know her beter and stuff to make sure that I want her to be my girlfriend. But what about Corisha.....ugh this is a really hard decision to make. I don't know, Im gonna think about it for a while.

*Morgans POV*

Maybe I should ask Zach if he wants to hangout. Maybe I will. Before I go over there I put on my sweat pants and a hoodie and white vans. Ok so now I am walking over to Zachs and im getting nervous bc I don't know if he is only or with his friends and he might say no he cant hangout. What do I say if he says no? Ugh idk.....oh god well. Will see what goes on. So I walk up to the door and the door swings open. Its Zach. "Hey Zach want to hangout?" I say. "Sure, lets play soccer in my back yard since I have a goal" Zach says. "ok " I say back. So now we are in his backyard and we are playing soccer and out of no where, I trip. Zach starts to giggle and then comes and sees if I am ok. I told him that I was alright. And after that Zach suggested to go inside and just chill for a while. So we decide to watch a movie... a scary moive called "Insidious 2" Oh god I know im gonna get scared.....
