Hi. I'm 3D. My favorite colors are blue and red, but I prefer the darker shades. I guess you could call me goth but in my opinion, I'm not. I like dresses but I like goth Lolita kind of dresses that are usually black with white crosses, white with black crosses or just dark red and blue. I think Leonna is really lucky to have Sollux because his eyes are my favorite colors. Anyways, nice to meet ya. Can I go now? *from the distance, some says yes* Ok. *leaves*
