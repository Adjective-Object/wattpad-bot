We already got Fili, Kili, Dwalin, Oin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Nori, Ori, and Dori. The only ones we needed to get before the meeting in the Blue Mountains then the shire were Balin and Gloin. We arrived at some other dwarf kingdom. An elderly dwarf came up to us. "Hi. I'm Michelle. You must be Balin." I bowed.
"Indeed. You must be the one Gandalf sent me a letter about. Thorin, I need to speak with Michelle alone. I will bring her to you when I am done. Come with me child." Balin instructed.
I followed Balin to an office. I sat down in a chair. Balin examined me. He looked at my ears and nodded. "Gandalf was right. You and your siblings will slowly become your true form. You and your brother are going to be elves. Your sister is going to be a dunedain. You must be careful about doing anything or saying anything elves do." Balin said.
"I know. It will keep the other dwarves from finding out and hating me." I sighed.
"Here is a contract I made for you."
I had to sign where it said seer. I signed it. Balin led me to where Thorin and Gloin were speaking. "I'd like to welcome the newest member of the company. Michelle the seer." Balin announced making me blush in embarrassment. A little dwarfling ran up to me.
"I'm Gimli. I will go on adventures too when I get older." The dwarfling smiled.
"I know your future. You will go one an important adventure in 60 years." I added.
"Sweet. I better start practicing."
Gimli ran away. Gloin was chuckling. Gimli came back with two wooden swords. "Will you teach me how to fight? Thorin says that you are a great fighter." Gimli stated. I noticed Thorin blush slightly.
"I haven't fought before. He saw me practice for the first time. Maybe you can teach me." I suggested.
"Then you can teach me when you become an expert."
"Ok. Let's start."
Gimli tossed me a wooden sword. He charged at me. I twirled around to dodge the attack. Gimli charged again. I decided to give him a chance to hit me. Gimli swat at my leg. I pretended to fall. Gimli held the fake sword at my helicopter wound. I yelped in pain. Gimli backed away tears forming in his eyes. I rushed to his side.
"I didn't mean to hurt you." Gimli cried.
"It wasn't you. I was stabbed in my stomach before I met Thorin. It got stitched up. It wasn't you. I promise." I said.
"Gimli, why don't you go practice more with your friends?" Gloin requested.
"Ok." Gimli sighed then ran off with both fake swords.
"Show us the wound." Thorin demanded.
I lifted my shirt up to the wound. It was infected. Balin left to get something. He came back with a bag of medicine and herbs. He sanitized the wound and put medicine on it. He gave me some herbs to eat. I ate the herbs.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Thorin asked.
"I'm still pissed off at you." I stated.
"Let's just get going." Thorin sighed.
"See y'all at the meeting in the shire."
