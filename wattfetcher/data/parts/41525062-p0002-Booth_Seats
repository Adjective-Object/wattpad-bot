She talked about her dream to become a lawyer, but lamented on how far off that idea was, which led into a discussion about how mad she was about the treatment of women, which then caused her to remark at how Ryunosuke wasn't laughing at her or telling her to shut up, which circled back to her skepticism about the whole meeting.

What was her name? Oh, how could he forget to ask that? Eventually, the sun began to set, and they both got on their bikes.
"I'll be heading off now. See you later...?"
"Naruhodo Ryunosuke! And you are?"
"Mikotoba Susato. It was really nice talking to you. Maybe we could do that again sometime?" Without waiting for his response, she sped off to her home. Ryunosuke never felt better in his life and felt like he soared as he biked home. Mikotoba Susato! What a wonderful name!

The next day, she saw Ryunosuke in the hallway, walking to her father's class. She excitedly ran up to him, ready to tell him about more of her thoughts.
