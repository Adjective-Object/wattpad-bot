"He's been drugged and lost quite a bit of blood! Help me get him inside someone!" A werewolf helps lift him up. He carries Andy inside. I follow them. I look around the place to see that it's nicely decorated and kept very clean. I look over to see the wolf put Andy down on the couch.
"I'm Josh. What's your name miss?"
"Kat." I say simply.
"Nice to meet you Kat. This is my wife, Britney." He points to the vampire who has now stood beside Andy.
"Nice to meet you both. You have children?" I askThey look at each and then back to me.
"We've tried and tried but we were successful once but.." Britney trails off. I look to the ground before speaking once more.
"What happened?" I ask them. Britney looks down and Josh walks over to her and hugs her close. He gives me the biggest death stare.
"That was a bit rude to ask right away miss Kat...but our child didnt make it..."
"Oh im sorry its just that im with child. I didnt mean to offend." I announce. They're eyes widen and they both look at me. Britney runs over and softly sets her hand on my lower tummy and looks at me. She gets excited and giggly as Josh tries to wake Andy up.
"My finacè would be furious if he found out.." i say. Britney looks at me and steps back a little bit. Josh looks at Andy and pinches his nose. Andy wakes up gasping for air and then he covers his mouth. Britney grabs a bucket and hands to Andy as he vomits into it.
"So Kat is with child?" Josh asked him. He placed the bucket down and nodded.
"Yes with my child my friend." Andy said to Josh
"So she has fiancé?" Britney asks him. Andy looks over to me as the room falls silent.
"she does but its not me... it never will be."
