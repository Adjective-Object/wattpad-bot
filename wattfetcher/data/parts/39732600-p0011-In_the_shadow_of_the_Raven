But out of nowhere a knife went through the neck of one man. He dropped to the floor dead. The others drew weapons and their leader put away the knife drawing a sword.
"How dare you kill my men! Show yourself coward." He yelled, his face contorted in rage. Two more men dropped dead, knives protruding from their necks.
A figure stepped into the light.
"Noble!"Ciella screamed and strained against the ropes tying her down. Noble drew his sword, stepping forward.
"Well, what are you waiting for! Kill him!" The man shouted and several bandits surged towards him.
"Noble!" Ciella screamed and began crying.
"Your coming with me." he took the sword and sliced through her ties, cutting her arms and legs. She screamed again as he grabbed her arm, hauling her with him. Ciella put up a fight, and the last thing she saw was Noble fighting as a searing pain shot through her head. Her vision went black.
