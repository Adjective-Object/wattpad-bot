-note to reader-This book is about MAGCON but it won't have all of the people in MAGCON. In this book, MAGCON will only contain Carter Reynolds, Matthew Espinosa, Nash Grier, Hayes Grier, Jack Johnson, Jack Gillinsky, Cameron Dallas, Aaron Carpenter and Tez Mengestu.
Hey! I'm Kirsten Skye Espinosa,I'm 17, I live in Virginia and before you ask, yes I'm Matthew Espinosa's sister. If you don't know who Matthew is, i'll explain now. He is a famous Viner and he is part of this group called MAGCON, which stands for meet and greet convention. They go on tour and stuff like that.

I had just finished eating dinner and now I'm in my bedroom on my phone. *knock knock* "Come in!" I yelled. The door opened to reveal Matthew. "Hey Kirsten." He said as he sat next to me. "I was wondering if you wanted to come on tour with me this summer. It'll be fun! So what do you say?" "Does mom approve?" I asked. "Yup!" He said popping the "p". "When is it?" "It starts tomorrow, so if you are coming, you better get packing!" He smiled. I smiled back. "Well I guess I'll come!" He did a weird little happy dance as I laughed. He walked out the door so I could get packed but first, I logged onto twitter and posted:"@kirstenespinosa1997: Can't wait to go on tour with you guys! Love ya'll even though you guys don't know me yet!😘😆❤️ @camerondallas @nashgrier @hayesgrier @mrcarterreynolds @jackjackjohnson @jackgillinsky @tez @aaroncarpenter " I instantly got a mention from Nash! "@nashgrier: @kirstenespinosa1997 I can't wait to meet you baby! I'm sooo happy you agreed to come! See you tomorrow love!😚" then Carter mentioned me. "@mrcarterreynolds: Hey @kirstenespinosa1997 I'm so exited to meet you!😊" then Cameron. "@camerondallas: can't wait to spend time with you @kirstenespinosa1997 ☺️" Wow am I spoiled by them! I faved all of the tweets. I stood up and started packing my clothes for the summer!
*2 hours later*
I'm finally done packing! I sat on my bed and checked the time on my phone. 12:00am. I laid down and pulled the covers over my head and fell asleep.
