Ok first I'd like to say that NALU is bound to happen so don't get your hopes up on stuff like:Gralu and loluBut in my opinion They make a beautiful couple They have history and FUCK NALI!!
It's not that I hate lisanna but like even she loves NALU soI made my pointOh and I ship lisanna with a different Person but I really do like NALU but HEY! Don't get me wrong I do ship alotttttttt of people with
lucy and not really a lot with natsu but NALU Is the most awesome ship in whole freaking FT shipsThey can make laugh one sec and the next your crying
And how natsu protects her but of course THEY WILL BE CANON (Wait aren't they or is it still"One sided love"?)Ok well I'm done here NEXT!!!!
Point of page:Nalu is fucking AWESOME!Rating of ship:8/10
BYEEEEEE!!!!!!
