I woke up in the same room. I was really getting tired of blacking out. Bucky still sat in the chair, holding my hand, and absently running his thumb over the scars.

Hi again. I whispered.

Hi. How do you feel?

I don't really know. What is wrong with me?

Well. Your hands got ripped up. Your wrists only got minor scratching so you wont have scars there, but the rest of your hands have major cuts. You dislocated your left shoulder, broke your right wrist, and broke you left leg. You had a major concussion. You have a five inch long, one inch deep cut across the top of you collarbone that had to have stiches and is still healing. You have a four inch long, two inch deep cut right below your ribs that also had to have stiches. You also had a lot of small cuts and bruises. You have been in and out of consciousness for two weeks, allowing many of your smaller injuries to heal. Your vocal cords suffered temporary damage from smoke inhalation. The doctors said that you will have to stay at least another week.

Wow. Are you ok? I saw you collapse?

I am fine. I had a small concussion and I collapsed from exhaustion.

I am scared. I don't know what is going on anymore. Why didn't Hydra leave me? Why are they allowing you to be here? Oh Bucky.

I don't know. They have been nice. Too nice. They are planning something. But don't worry. Please. I wont let them hurt you. I promise.

Bucky listen. I. I..... want to thank you for saving me. Why do I matter to you anyway?

You are the most beautiful person I have ever had the honor of meeting. But your beauty doesn't come from outside. It comes from inside and shows on your skin. You are selfless. You changed my life. I was a monster but now I am a man. I was hopeless and had no reason to exist. But you changed that. You are my reason. My purpose. I don't deserve you. But you still stay with me.

Oh Bucky. You don't know how much that means to me. I promise that if we ever get out of here, I will stay with you. I promise. Bucky. I swear.

I don't think we will ever get out of here. I am ...... afraid. I am scared that they will hurt you. That we wont ever get out of here. That they will wipe you and that you wont remember me. I dream about that you know? Oh darling. If only you knew how much you meant to me.

Bucky. I... You make me forget reality.

I began to fall asleep. Bucky gripped my hand a little tighter and planted a kiss on my forehead. I smiled as I drifted off into a dream.
