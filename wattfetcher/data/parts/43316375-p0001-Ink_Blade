"A long time ago, I was a traveling merchant, selling and trading; for a living. I met a lot of crazy people, saw a lot of crazy things, things that a normal person would normally never forget...
"...unfortunately though, I'm not a normal person, thus such things do not apply to me, I regret."
This the quest of a traveling merchant who travels the world, racing down these trails of black ink called "Ink Trails," in order to prevent Earth's unfortunate demise. Kirrin will be telling you of her journey, and will also note any terms that originate in the world of this story as she goes on. Perhaps you will sit on the comfy rug next to her antique rocking chair, with a cup of herbal tea made by Loura, as you observe Zeimon tend to the warm fire, then suddenly notice Kyeiho trying to pick on you.
Now, without further ado, let's listen to what Kirrin has to say.
