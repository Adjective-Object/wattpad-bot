"Nope I have only had like 2 girlfriends. Seth on the other hand. He doesn't date he fucks" I laughed and so did he.
"Yup thats Seth alright" Even though I went to a diferent school Seth had gotten around the girls at my school. It didn't surprise me.
"So you guys live with eachother?"
"Sadly yes. Its interesting. Lisa is pretty cool tho"
"Yeah she is. She made me piss myself laughig once."
"Nice!"
"Hahaha yeah" God that laugh was incredible. His looks where incredible. He had beautiful blue/green eyes. A strong bulid, and jaw line. He was picture perfect. God.
"Are you heading to my house?"
"Yeah. I came here casue my dad works here and he needed my car so I was waiting for Seth to pick me up" He said with a half smile.
"Tell him you have a ride. Hop in" I said unlocking my doors.
"Wow thanks hahaha"
"No problem."
We arrived at my house a couple minutes later. Seth was standing outside and the look on his face was priceless.
"What the hell man?" He said to Casper.
"Relax Seth all I did was give him a ride. Calm your dick" I said walking past him. Casper let out a chuckle and Seth glared at him.
"Stay away from my Step sister Casper" Seth said harshly
"Seth I can talk to him if I want! I can do whatever the fuck I want! Stay off my back and quit being a dick. Just cause you can't have me doesn't mean he can't" I said with a smug grin
"Listen Shea you will be mine" He said warningly.
"Nope never" I thought of something. I walked over to Casper and grabbed the colar of his shirt. I smashed his soft lips to mine and kissed him right infront of Seth. I broke the kiss between me and Casper and looked over at Seth.
"I'm not yours and never will be. Your a player. I don't go for players" I smiled at him and walked upstairs to my room. I closed the door and sunk to the floor, my back pressed against the door. I lifted my hands to my lips and touched them softly. Casper was a great kisser.
