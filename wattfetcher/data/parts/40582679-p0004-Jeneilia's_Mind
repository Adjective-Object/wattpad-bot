My uncle got shoted by a criminal because my uncle wouldn't let him have his house. My uncle inherit is house from Is parents and he worked hard to build up and support his house! So he wouldn't just give up his house like that not after all he did to it or all the years he spent in it! I mean who would?? And that guy took out his gun and shot my uncle and he's out there running around hiding from the police while my uncle is under ground all alone :( . I hope they catch him and lock him up because he desever it!!!! How can this guy go around killing innocent people and get away with it my uncle doesn't deserve to be dead he is such a good man!!! And he died leaving his girlfriend with a 3 year old nab baby and an unborn . Is girlfriend is in a mess she can't believe neither can I . I'm so hurt and upset that man should be found and be punished I know it wont bring my uncle back but it'll stop him from killing other innocent people!!!!!. ~Jeneilia XXX
