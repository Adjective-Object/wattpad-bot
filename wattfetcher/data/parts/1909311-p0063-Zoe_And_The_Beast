A/N: Just wanting to change things up a bit, I decided to post this...a little excerpt from Beast's past. Enjoy :) Comment and vote if you like it! Note: Please listen to the music while you're watching, if you can.

My fingers raked the room, raiding everything they could find. Bookshelves, the closet, what was underneath the bed, the desk; everything. I had clawed through the living room, the kitchen, and the bathroom already. There was nothing.
He was a murderer, there had to be something. I tore through his bedsheets, and scrambled through his drawers.
Pencils, notebooks, movies...there had to be -
Oh shit.
Brushing aside a notebook, my eyes caught onto a speck of deep black metal. I pushed away whatever was in the way, then picked up the black object, my fingers trembling.
A gun.
Oh god. The dark exterior, the fragile interior. It was hauntingly heavy in my hands, too heavy for its own good. A feeling of power came over me, creeping up slowly.
With this little object in my hand, this time little thing...I could kill. I could release everything inside of me, let it all out...with a little click. I little pull.
My fingers skimmed over it as I examined the ridges. Smooth, soft, and coil. There was a golden bullet on the inside, barely visible. Slowly and steadily, I clutched the gun into position, aiming at the mirror in front of me.
Smiling slightly, I let the gun snap straight in front of my reflection. This was what I wanted to do for so long. For so fucking long.
This was it.

A/N: 8 months and I finally updated. Dang, I'm so terribly sorry guys. I have no excuse, really. I'm just really sorry. Please comment and vote if you like this!
