I fed Sammy some until he didn't want anymore, I walked into the bathroom puking again this time, it was too much. "Cameron!" I groan crying, I puke again. "What?" He asks, I open the door, "Wanna help me on this one, cause I'll sure enjoy it." I snapped at him.
He looked at me, I looked pale and sick, I puked again and he held my hair. I start crying again, and stopped puking, "I'll tell mom to ask the doctor if you are supposed to puke this much." Cameron said I nodded.
I brush my teeth then rinsed my mouth out and washed my face, I look in the mirror seeing Hudson, I turn my head quickly and don't seem him there, I dizzily walked into the kitchen to Cameron, "Cameron?" I say I sit on the floor and he feels my head, "You're burning up." he said he gave me a liquid medicine, I kept it down but I rushed to the bathroom.
"Ugh I hate this!" I say I puked again and brushed my teeth and rinsed my mouth out. I walked out and Cameron puts me next to Sammy, I groan again. "What's wrong babe?" Sammy asked, "I have a high fever, I've thrown up since twelve, and I keep hallucinating." I tell him, "It's okay." he said.
"Try keeping this down." Cameron handed me a banana and water, I ate the banana and drunk the water, it did go down, so I fell asleep with Sammy's arms wrapped around me.
