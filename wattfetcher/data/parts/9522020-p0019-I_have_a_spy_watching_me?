"I am to. Also sorry for getting mad earlier Jaycie. I hadn't known there were more people that she hugged and well you know I don't really like it when I don't know who it is she is hugging. One reason is because she is mine and only mine just like I am hers and only hers." I'm guessing Eric said as he sat next to Lydia.
"Oh that's fine. I know if my, umm, boyfriend was hugging another person I'd like to know them as well." I said to Eric.
"Hehe see I told you she wouldn't be so rude about it like the others. Here the nice looking people are the nice looking people. Morse looks mean so he is mean and he certainly does have his moments." Lydia said
"Lydia why do you always make fun of me? Why can't you go make fun of one of your other friends or better yet make fun of Greg if you want to bully a brother." Morse sighed out.
Yeah Morse and Lydia are also siblings. Justin and I are the only ones that don't really hang around our siblings until we get home. Speaking of siblings, I wonder where mine went. He isn't at his table. That got me confused, he said that he wanted to sit with me. He was suppose to eat lunch with me right now. I didn't see him anywhere though. What is he up to?

Well now, that was so hard to get this chapter out, but I just wanted to add just a few more important characters. They're important for my reasons, but you know that's as good as an unbroken pinky promise that is going to be fulfilled. SO tell me how ya'll like it! I did most of this on my iPod, but the rest I did on my sisters laptop. Also excuse all the mistakes in grammar and spelling. I try to reread and get most of the grammar fixed, but if I didn't I am sincerely sorry.
