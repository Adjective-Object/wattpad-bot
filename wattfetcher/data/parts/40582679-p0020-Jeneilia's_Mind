Today was just normal and boring as hell. So anyways Mick doesn't own a wattpad but she wanted me to tell whoever reads this hi and I was like lmao okay I'll tell my invisible fan base. I didn't know what to write about but Mick says I should talk about me and how I am feeling about myself and life and I thought okay I'll do it so here goes crap.
I'm gonna talk about me first so yeah one thing I know about me is that I'm really nice I've heard it from a lot of people and its a good thing but its also really bad because people tend to take advantage of you when your too nice and I hate that. I'm always that girl who tries to like help everyone and try to make everyone happy but people think I'm gonna always be there to help them and make them happy but no one day I'm just gonna stop because throughout all these times I'm trying to make em happy and make sure that there better non of them ever stopped and asked if I was happy or better and its like I wasn't doing anything for them. I hate that just because people always see me smiling or laughing they assume I have the perfect life or that I'm super happy all the time and I'm just like hell to the damn NO!!!!!! I am non of the above I don't have a good life sometime I wish I could just run away and leave the world behind. Dont assume im happy all the time just because I'm wearing a smile cause the saddest times in my life is when I smile and laugh the most.
So now I'm gonna talk about how I'm feeling about life. To be honest I think having life is a blessing but then again it can be so shitty and upsetting  like one second my life is going alright then it just goes right down. I have my times when I really enjoy life like when I'm talking with my friends and joking around or when I'm helping people etc.
So that was a pretty shitty chapter just like all other chapters lmao love you lots like jelly tots ~Jeneilia
