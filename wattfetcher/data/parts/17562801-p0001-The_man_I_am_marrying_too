Saturday 8am
When the night has come and the land is dark
Y la luna es la luz que brilla ante mí
Miedo no, no tendré, oh I won't, no me asustare
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
I wake up to my future husband singing. I turn off the alarm and sit up its time to go look for my wedding dress. I get up and take a shower I look at my closet to see what to wear. I choose an American eagle graphic tank with skinny jean and my black and white converse. I text Leslie and Luz to see if there ready to go Leslie tells me yes while Luz texts me saying she barley woke up IDIOT!! She knows this is really important but at the same time I know she always like this. I get in to my red honda and go pick up Leslie and Luz. I just hope Luz doesn't take 2 hrs to do her hair!👎
