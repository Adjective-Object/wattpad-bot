...What I don't understand is why they'd treat me like this.



I know. I know that it's probably because they don't want me to get hurt...but it's not like I'd put myself in danger. If they end up battling against each other, then I'd be able to help them! I mean, I can see their status, if they're in a critical state or not. I can help. I can... Besides....



"....I belong, don't I?" I asked softly, my voice almost cracking.





France was just silent, but I can see the dichotomy in his eyes. "(Name)...I..."




I took a step forward, to get closer...but France shook his head.



"(Name), please forgive us for this." he said as he quickly walked out the door and slammed it shut. I rushed towards it to follow him, but it seems he was  still leaning on the other side.


Banging my hand on the door, I exclaimed. "France! France, let me out of here!!"




"I'm sorry." he said from the other side.

As I heard that, I tried turning the knob. It won't budge.





Locked.



In my frustration, I kicked the door. Not a smart move. It just made my foot hurt a little.



"What the fck are they thinking?! I can't believe them!" I said to myself, reaching for the phone.
