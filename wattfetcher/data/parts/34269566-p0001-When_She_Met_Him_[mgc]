A/N - HI!!! This is my new story! 😁I've decided that this story will be about Emily herself and then at the end she will meet Michael. if people like this enough I might even do a sequel to continue it, but for now, like the prologue suggests, this will be the story of how she meets him.I'm going to write it all first and then publish it bit by bit just so that you don't spend ages waiting for me to update. it's probably going to have really short chapters but hopefully it will be good. I'm excited to write it! I hope you read this and enjoy it too 💕💕💕💕-kirsten x
