"Foreign scents." He growls. "They aren't rogues, though."
I stare at him, scared.
At that moment, wolves leap out and slash at my parents, who take one look at me and start fighting!
"Papi!"
My father glances at me and tells me to run. I refuse.
"Run!" I look helplessly at my mother as she struggles to pull two grey wolves off of her mate, getting clawed by a grey wolf in the process.
"RUN!"
Tears stream down my face as I let my legs carry me away, deep into the forest. I see the last parts of my parents get torn apart and their last words on their lips.
"We love you son, run!"
I see the wolves turn towards me snarl. My eyes widen but I still pump my legs harder, obeying my mother's final wish. Up ahead, I see a cottage and knock, where an elderly couple pull my frantic body in. They hear my story and decide to take me in.
As I lay in my room at night I think of my parents dying. My mother's sorrowful eyes about leaving her baby behind. I know she can't hear me, but I still answer her final requests like an obedient pup.
"Yes, mother."
'I love you too.'
