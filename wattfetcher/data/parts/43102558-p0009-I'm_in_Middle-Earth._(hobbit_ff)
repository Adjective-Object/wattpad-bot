Thorin's POV....
I raised my hand and slapped Michelle in front of everyone. "I hate you!" Michelle screamed in tears. She ran off. I realized what I did. I was about to run after her to apologize. Fili stopped me. He shook his head. He ran in the direction Michelle went in. I walked inside. My heart was hurting for some reason. I turned my attention to the burglar.
Michelle's POV....
Someone came running up to me. They sat down beside me and held me close. I saw some of a blonde beard. Fili. I smiled. I staid in his arms. "Uncle didn't mean to slap you. He would have came to speak to you, but I stopped him not wanting anything to go wrong. I'm here for you. You can release all of your tears. I will be your shoulder to cry on." Fili grinned. I wiped my tears away and looked up at him.
"Thank you Fili." I smiled.
"I'll do anything for you."
"Ok."
"Let's head back to the others. I saved you a plate of food and a mug of ale."
"Just what I need." I laughed.
We walked back to the hobbit house. I chose to ignore Thorin. I sat down in a corner. Fili brought me my food and drink. He pulled a chair over beside mine and sat down. I kept the mark from the slap hidden. I ate my food and drank the drink. I felt someone staring at me. I saw Thorin gazing at me in sorrow. The others had the meeting then went to bed. I walked outside to be alone. I sat down on the bench.
The door opened then closed. Someone joined me. A hand forced me to face its owner. The moonlight hit my skin. Thorin moved the hair covering the mark. He glanced it over. I let out the air I held in.
"I'm very sorry for hitting you. I lost my temper. I should not have hit you. It was wrong of me to take all of my anger out on you. I hope you can for-" Thorin rambled.
I stopped him with a kiss. I continued to kiss him. It felt right. Thorin kissed back. I pulled away to breathe. "You need to learn not to ramble. Good night." I sighed and stood up. I walked back into the house. I found Fili sleeping peacefully. My heart skipped a beat when I heard him say my name. What is going on with me? I thought. I laid down beside Fili then fell asleep.
