After finishing my math and science, the table was finished. My books were taken away and I returned to my stool. I was really enjoying that scene. I didn't have any lines and I just got to laugh at everyone. It was a lot of fun. Once everyone was ready, we started the scene again.
"And... Action!"
They began their lines again and I twirled the glass in my hand. When Tony was attempting to lift it, I brought the glass to my mouth and took a large mouthful of my water. The only problem was, it did not taste like water.
I immediately spit it out of my mouth and made gagging noises. My hands tried to wipe it off my tongue, but the taste wouldn't leave. It was extremely bitter and did not taste good at all.
"What the hell is that?!" I screamed out. I was jumping up and down trying to get rid of the horrible taste. My mouth was watering and it was making weird noises every few seconds.
"What, you don't like vodka?" Robert yelled back. My eyes widened as I realized what I just drank. That bitch replaced my water with vodka.
"No, no I don't!" The cast was laughing at my reaction and I couldn't get it off my tongue. Brendon then threw me a water bottle and I downed it. For the most part the vodka was gone, but it still lingered a bit here and there.
"So, how was your first drink?" Robert slapped me on the back.
"Terrible. I hate you," I coughed out.
"Aw you know you love me!"
"Oh just you wait," I mumbled, already forming a plot of revenge.
Hello peeps. Thank you all for reading and I hope you all enjoyed! :)
That was like the shortest A/N I've done...
