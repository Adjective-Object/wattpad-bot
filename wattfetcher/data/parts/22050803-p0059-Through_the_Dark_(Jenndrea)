"Don't worry, okay? We'll talk about this later," Andrea told her, "now, c'mon, my parents are probably wondering why we've been gone for so long."

Hours passed to what logically would be dinner time, but Lauren and Arden rarely ever ate at that time. Oftentimes, they would eat a meal around midnight, counting it as their dinner. Still, it was six o'clock, and neither of them had any clue what they were doing.
"Arden, why don't they want to spend New Year's Day with us?" Lauren asked, reaching for her phone.
Arden shrugged. "Oh, I don't know, maybe because there's no space to park, or maybe because our doors bother them, or -- it's insane, I know -- maybe it's because they want privacy or to get away from somewhere they were almost killed, but to be honest, I don't know."
"Should we get new doors then?"

"Lauren just called me. She asked if she needed new doors," Andrea said as she walked inside, sounding completely confused. Jenn couldn't clear it up either.
"Yeah, she just texted me that," Jenn said, lying on the couch. Andrea took a seat next to her. Her parents were out of sight.
Andrea slowly crept towards Jenn, kissing her the moment she reached the top. Jenn pulled her closer, grasping at the fabric of Andrea's shirt unknowingly. Just as Andrea leaned in for another kiss, the door bursted open. She leapt off Jenn, who tried sitting up and straightening herself out.
Andrea saw two familiar faces who were most definitely not her parents.
