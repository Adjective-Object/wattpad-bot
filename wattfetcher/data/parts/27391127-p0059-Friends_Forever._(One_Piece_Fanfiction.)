"Because I'm too busy reading." Sakura answered, going back to getting lost in the plot off the book. That was until, Luffy pulled the book away from her?
"What is this?" Luffy asked holding the book above herhead.
"Give it back!" Sakura shouted, attempting to grab the book. Luffy merely stretched his legs until he was taller than her and kept reading the book.
"No fair!" Sakura whined, kicking Luffy's shin.  Luffy fell on her belly and she regreted that choice for the rest of the day.
Sakura once again, had tried to take the book away from Luffy who was by now trying to read the first word on the first page.  Sakura had an idea and wrapped herself around Luffy  in her hybrid-dragon form.
"Luffy, give me back my book!" Sakura shouted choking him.
"No way" You won't play with me!"
"That's not the issue here!"
"That is the issue!"
"Would you guys..." Ace started walking towards them. Luffy and Sakura paused taking the time to have the most scared faces in the world.

"SHUT THE FUCKING HELL UP!" He shouted after beating Luffy and Sakura into lifeless pulps.
"G-Gomensai." They both breathed.
"That's my Ace-kun. Giving well-deserved punishment to the naughty." Haruka stated with anime tears running down his face.
"So you're alive." Zoro said darkly.
"However, didn't you change the suffix. Wasn't it -sama before?" Aya asked.
"Shut the fuck up you damn auto-correct." Haruka hissed. Then Aya slapped him.

Again, a little while later........

The detention room was once again quiet. Quiet meaning that Luffy was knocked out and Zoro was sleeping. A very rare occurrence indeed.

Sakura went back to reading her book when...
"Psst."
She tried her best to ignore it but the prson was very persistent.
"Psst."
"What the hell do you want, Luffy?" She screamed-whispered.
"Let's prank Kid!"
"Do you have a death wish?!" She whispered.
"Maybe." Luffy chuckled.
"No."
"I have Sharpies!"
"Sharpies have nothing to do with this.....wait...Did you say Sharpie?"
"I knew you'd give in!"
"Damn Sharpies and their usefulness." Sakura cursed under her breath.
"What'd ya two doing?" Aya asked looking at the duo sitting on the floor, organizing their Sharpie markers and plan.
"We're trying to prank Kid." Luffy laughed.
"Do the two of you want to die."
"That's exactly what I tod him but his stubborness is as Strong as one of the Deans!" Sakura exclaimed pointing to Luffy's innocent smile.
