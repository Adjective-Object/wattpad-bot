I end up worried about everything. Plus the amount of headcanons for Hetalia is overwhelming! //flails//
So here's a small update about the world for people who rather be on Instagram!~
- 6500 people have already died in Ukraine and everybody blames Russia. As long as the fucking US is in this, Russia won't leave.
- Norway just saved 600 Africans, so applause for him. Mostly pregnant women.
- The heath has killed 700 people in Pakistan...
- One of the men of my family is getting a monument-- Be proud
- Marit fucking Bj√∂rgen is pregnant. The world shall celebrate.
- The government keeps on being bitchy and we don't give a damn. It's like all Finns just shrug, sip on their black coffee and go "Meh... Let them do what they do. If it goes to far, some crazy bitch is going to shoot someone important anyways..."
