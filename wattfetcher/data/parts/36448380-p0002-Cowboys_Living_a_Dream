"Ok. Come around 6:30. Ok?"
"Ok," then the bell rang and all the seniors flud in. And my favorite class of the day starts. The day flew by and by the time I knew it, it is lunch. I was to my locker and see all of my friend already there.
"Hey guys!" I tell them. My group of friends comsists of Maddie, Amy, Liam, Jennifer, Aden and Jacob. Maddie and Jacob are dating. Amy and Liam are dating. And Jennifer and Aden are dating. I am the only one without a boyfriend. But I don't really care. They all just hug me at one time. I love my friends.
"It feels like I haven't seen you in forever!" the blond haired brown eyed Jennifer tells me.
"I just saw you last week and texted with you last night." I tell her. I just roll my eyes as everybody else greets me and I open my locker and grab my lunch. They all head to the lunch room. I tell them that I will meet them there. I stay at my locker for a minute and grab my phone out of my pocket and text my Mama to remind me to wash my truck afer school. I know she will be working but going in for lunch soon. I am soon scared by someone grabing me in the side. I scream and turn around to see Ben standng there with a big smurch on him face. I just laugh and roll my eyes, put my phone back in my pocket and shut my locker then walk to the lunch room to see all of my friend there. I sit there with them. We talk some and after lunch is over I walk to my next class.
School went by fast and I was soon sitting one the tailgate of my truck waiting for Tommy. When he gets there he tells me about his day and I tell him about mine. Then we hop in my truck (after we put the tailgate up) and head home.
When we get home, I but on my work boots and do my chores. Which consist of cleaning the horse stalls, getting the chicken eggs, and feeding the cows their dinner. When I walk in the house, I pull of my muddy boots and go to my room to change. When I get downstairs, my Mama is in the kitchen making dinner. I tell her I am going to Ben for dinner.
"Hey. Did you wash your truck?" she asks me. Crap. I completally forgot to wash my truck.
"Mama, uh, can I please borrow your truck?!?! I forgot to wash mine and it is really muddy." I ask her with high hopes she will let me.
"Your Daddy has it. Sorry but, you are going to have to drive your truck." This makes me disapointed in myself for not washing it. I had even been thinking about it all day.
"Ok. Bye," is all I say headed out the door to Ben's house. In my muddy truck.
When I get to his house it is exactally 6:30. I walk up to the front door and knock. He answers and invites me in taking my jacket. Such a gentleman. The smells coming front the kitchen are amazing. I say hi to his parents and his brother Michael. We all talk a bit. Eat dinner and before I know it, it is 8 o'clock and I have to get home. So I saw my goodbyes and Ben walks me to my car.
"How was the food?" He asks me helping me up into my truck.
"It was good," I say starting the engine.
"I'm glad you got to come."
"Me too."
"I will see you at school tomorrow?"
"O fcourse you will." I say with a smile.
"Bye."
"Bye." I tell him and close my door and trive home. When I get home everybody is watching a movie. I say goodnight to all of them and head upstairs to bed. Wanting tomorrow to come because today was great. It was a great day. That was my last thought before I drift off into a long peaceful sleep.
