"Hey Jill!" Bill said to Jill as she came up to him
"Hi Bill!" Jill said back.
"Do you know why we're doing this?" Bill asked.
"I have no clue." Jill replied.
The bad way
I am just a block of text, with no rhyme or reason to me. There's no need for me to keep writing this, but I'm trying to prove a point. Oh hey, here comes Bob! "Hi Bob!" I said to Bob. "Hey Mary." Bill said back. "Why are we doing this?" I asked. "Isn't this hard to read?" "It sure is." Bob replied.
See what I'm saying? It's hard to read and it's annoying.
Now then...
I found a story in the poetry section that was about OneDirection. And this wasn't a poem...
No, this person wrote out the whole freaking information on OneDirection.
What.
The.
Hell?
That's not a poem, that's a biography.
Well, I'm now off to go find stories in desperate need of fixing.
