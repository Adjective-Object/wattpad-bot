Katelyn and I made a new phobia. The phobia of being afraid of Andy. We call it andyphobia. So, just to make sure it's not a phobia already made, I searched it up. There is a person on Facebook NAMED Andy Phobia. But it is not a real phobia, well it is now. Andyphobia is now an official, well in my mind it is. Andyphobia is the fear of an obnoxious, teenage girl that won't shut up when told, named Andy.
