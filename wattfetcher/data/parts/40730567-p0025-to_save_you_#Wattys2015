Maybe in another world, i would be over you. like i would be sitting in my favorite coffee shop in nyc and i'll be reading my favorite book for the fiftieth time. when i'll look up and see you standing across the street, waiting for the crosswalk to tell you when to go. you'll be wearing the same peacoat you've had for years and i'll watch the way your breath floats through the cold morning air. i won't get up and run out so we can catch up. and i won't let tears fall either because i won't recall memories of us. i won't cave in at the sight of you bc one day, in another world, i'll be over you. but this is the world we live in, and i'm still pathetically in love with you. i don't think i will ever fall out of love with you.

This time, she felt like she had nothing to live for anymore. She quickly wrote a letter in her messy handwriting, and took the bottle of pills hidden in her drawers.
She closed her eyes, and fell into a deep slumber.
One that would last forever.
And her last words were for a boy, who had unknowingly ripped her heart out, tore it open and stepped on it, until nothing of it was left.
Abrielle didn't belong here. This wasn't her home.
