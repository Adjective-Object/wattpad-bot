"What?"
"What if I let Grinny stay with you for a week?"
"REALLY?!?!??!" Natalie asked in excitement while her purple eyes lighted up.
"Sure! He already likes you and comes to your house every night! So why not?"
"Awesome! Thanks!"
"No prob!" I replied to her.
The rest of the car ride was pretty enjoyable. We talked about a lot of random things like we normally did. Natalie made fun of the way Jeff looks like she normally did, but I didn't mind. I never did. What Jeff doesn't know, won't hurt him,right? Besides, Jeff already knows that Natalie makes fun of him. She does that to him everyday. Natalie really does hate Jeff.
Natalie pulled up to the entrance of the forest as always. I unbuckled my seat belt and grabbed my purse.
"When will you be able to drop off Grinny?" Natalie asked as I opened the car door.
"Uuuuummmm.......," I thought about when to drop him off. "Is Sunday okay?"
"Sure! Sounds cool!"
"Awesome." I said as I slipped out of the car.
"Oh! Say hi to Toby for me!!"
"Will do!" I said as I rolled my eyes and chuckled a bit.
"See ya soon!" Natalie waved me off.
"Later!" I said as I slammed the car door shut.
I watched Natalie drive off before I headed down the trail. As soon as Natalie's car was out of sight, I turned around and walked down the forest trail to my house. I enjoyed looking at the scenery past by me. I liked living in a forest. Not only is it peaceful, but it's beautiful! I love the outdoors.
Minutes later, as I continued walking, I could hear footsteps behind me. When I turned around, no one was there. I assumed it was just an animal or something, so I just continued to walk. I heard the footsteps again as they were getting closer. When I stopped walking and stood there for a moment, the footsteps stop. Just when I was about to turn around and ask who's there, I got tackled to the ground.
I screamed as I fell to the ground. Who ever tackled me pinned me down while they were on top of my back. Judging by the weight, you could definitely tell that whoever attacked was male. When I looked up to see who tackled me, my eyes lit up a bit and I smiled to see a very familiar face.
"Hi Masky!"
"Hello Miss Jessica!" he joyfully greeted me.
Masky got off of me and stood up beside me. He held out his hand as I took a hold of it. I kinda grunted as he pulled me up. I wasn't hurt or anything, though. When I finally stood up, I patted away the dirt on pants as Masky stood over me. Masky was a bit taller then me, but was a bit shorter than Jeff.
"You alright?" he asked.
"Yeah! I'm fine!" I assured him.
"That's good."
I looked around and noticed that he was alone."So, where's Hoodie?" I asked.
"Right here!" I heard a voice coming from beyond.
Masky and I looked the other way to see Hoodie walking towards us. I smiled as I saw him. When he finally came towards us, I happily gave him a hug.
"Hi Hoodie!"
"Hello there Miss Jessica!" he greeted me as he hugged me back.
