"Elina, did you know that ?" I glared at her.
"Uh, maybe" The played with her fingers.
"What a great surprise, Mixed sleepover" Jake grinned.
"What ?" I asked.
"Uh, Peter's parents didn't let him have us so.... I invited them" Simon said.
"ARE YOU CRAZY ?!! I TOLD YOU MY FRIENDS ARE COMING OVER"
"Calm down, there's enough space for all of us" Jake smiled, I rubbed my face in anger.
"Elina, we're going home, get your bags" I said and Elina whined.
"Don't be so grumpy" Jake said.
"Ikhrass" I said.
"what ?" Everyone asked.
"She told you to shut up in Arabic" Elina explained for me.
"cool" Everyone said.
The bell rang again.
"I'll get that" Jake opened.
"Heeeeey boys" and here comes, the hottness group.
"I see some chicks" Lewis said.
"*cough* Hey" Elina said.
"hello babe" Lewis kissed her.
"Ewwww" I wrinkled my nose.
"I'm leaving in a taxi, you can stay, Elina" I took my bag and opened the door.
"Wait" Tom caught my hand, all the girls gasped and I heard them whispering saying that I'm lucky, I stared at his hand and he pulled it back.
"I'm sorry, but no matter how many boys are here, it'll be safer than going in a taxi alone" He said.
"Awwwwwwwwh, you look cute together" William teased.
"Shut up" Tom said.
"Tom is right, it's safer here" Ashley said.
"Stay" Simon said "I won't throw you over my back again" he continued.
"Okay, but wallah if anybody touches me or annoys me he'll get punched in the face" I threatened.
The bell rang again, I hate that bell.
Tom opened the door " Hey Damon" What ? Damon ??
"Hey everybody" Damon waved, the girls almost fainted.
"You knew it, right ?" I glared at Damon.
"maybe" He smiled.
"Come on girls, let's go upstairs" I said.
"Party pooper" William said, the girls agreed.
"Let's watch a movie" Simon said.
"Horror" Lewis said, they all agreed.
"We need some popcorn" Diana said.
"I'll make it, I'd do anything to get rid of these boys for minutes" I said and headed to the kitchen.
"I'll show you where the plates and popcorn are" Simon followed me.
"You're the nicest between them" I said.
"thanks" He showed me his perfect crystal teeth in a wide smile.
"What are you doing here" William asked.
"Hunting horses" I answered sarcastically.
"Ha ha, funny. I'm hungry" William said.
