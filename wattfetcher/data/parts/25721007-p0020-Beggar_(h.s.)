The four get back by the time the pizza arrives. We all sit on the couch and get into deep conversation. I even talk to Zayn a few times. Then I go to bed early, in Harry's room again.
Finally, everything is going my way.. for now.
Helloooo! Okay so I updated twice today bc that last chapter was horrible. But I love you guys and I hate slacking. And I personally am proud of this chapter.
Oh and that plot twist though about Brock being Harry's father. Whut even? I made sure to put a little Hennon action too. Lol.
Vote! <3
