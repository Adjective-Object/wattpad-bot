"I've been thinking....Do you kn-..." Russia stopped.
"Do I..what?" The girl asked.
Russia shook his head. He was silent for a while, but then spoke once more.
"You... You have something on your face."
The girl's hand shot up to her cheek. "Wh-What? Where?" She asked.
The man reached his gloved hands towards the girl and wiped off something from the her right cheek with his thumb. He then looked closely at his thumb and said, ".......Huh."
The girl gave a confused look. "What's wrong?"
Russia then looked at her and replied.
"It seems like pink and blue icing."
____'s eyes suddenly widened. Horror was written all over her face. "That's...I...well..."
Now, Russia found this intriguing. It wasn't supposed to mean anything to him but...her reaction made him suspicious of the girl.
He was about to ask more questions when a loud ringing of a cellphone was heard.
"Argh!! S... sorry, it's my cell phone." England apologised.
China tilted his head. "Again? Russia's also rang earlier."
"Same here! We heard a piano!" Italy exclaimed.
England gave a puzzled look. "A piano? Well, anyway, I'll answer it."
No voice was heard, but there was a sound of a piano.
"It really was a piano. But it was a different note from the one that Russia heard. Italy, did you also hear a different note?" Japan asked.
Italy nodded. "Yeah, it was different."
"Only one note. That's the only thing in common. But there is no doubt that they're a big hint. We should all solve this one by one." England stated.
"Yes. If we do that, we'll soon be able to meet America and France. Though they'll probably get mad at us for taking so long." Japan said.
"Eh? What?" Italy said, confused.
"Huh? What are you talking about?" England asked as he furrowed his brows.
Japan then looked around him questioningly. "Er, what...Did I say something wrong?"
China turned to the man beside him. "... Russia."
Russia nodded. "Yes, I know. It's okay."
"Ex... cuse me?" Japan asked, obviously confused.
"You said 'something wrong'... was it on purpose? Not that I care to correct you, but...poor Prussia." England said sympathetically.
Italy agreed. "Yeah, why did you say France and America, Japan?
The ones we have to save are Prussia and France, right? Why did you say America?"
Now it was Canada's turn to get confused. "What?!"
"C-come on, now, what's wrong with you? We're here to save America, aren't we? Neither France nor Prussia came to this place." England explained.
Russia fell silent.
"Only... America? No, wait a minute..We-Well, America said at the meeting place that he wanted to come...
