3rd pov

Out near the woods was this mansion.Who did this mansion belong too?! Well of course the outrageous rich bratEHRMM It of course belong to the one and only Atobe Keigo."What do you want Atobe?Why did you call us here....AGAIN"Asked Oshitaru Yushi.

Oshitaru Yushi is a third year tennis regular at hyotei academy where of course the school Atobe goes too.

The rest of the people that Oshitaru meant are the rest of the boy tennis team.

Shisihido Ryo third years boys tennis team regular who is mostly seen playing doubles.

Chotaro Otori second year boy team regular and is mostly seen playing double with his partner and senpai Shisihido Ryo.

Jiro Akutagwa an sleepy third year regular who is mostly seen sleeping but when awake he a total air head -.-

Mukahi Gakuto third year regular an acrobatic player and is seen mostly playing doubles with his partner Oshitaru.

Hiyoshi Wakashi second year regular who is going to be the next captain got the boy team once they have graduated.

and finally Kabaji Munehiro third year regular who only listen to Atobe knowing him since forever. the only word we heard from his is "usu"pretty freaky right.

And this is the Hyotei boy tennis team regular and captain oh also including Atobe a very pompous rich brat ;-;

"I have thought of the most best idea ever right Kabji"Said Atobe. I would have said asked but no then you might see the word way to much.

"Usu"Kabji replied with his usual answer/(>.>)/

"huh?!"thought the regular while Oshitaru sighed in annoyance, Kabaji un-fazed, and many more I will leave it to your imagination.

"OK What is it this time."Asked Gakuto. "Well.."Atobe trailed off and told them his plan
