"When i was a little girl i use to sing in my mirror with my hair brush, i use to imange myself on a stage with my fans screaming my name, but my fans at that time we're my stuff animals. My mom would come in my room and just watch me and watch me dance around in my mirror like i would do as if i was  performing. I use to dream of the day when i would be on top me little Destiny and people ALL over the world would recongize my talent.... little did i know that time was coming ... and when it did ....it came harder than ever."
