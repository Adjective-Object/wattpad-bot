Suddenly I'm not half the girl I used to be.There's a shadow hanging over me.Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why he had to go, I don't know, he wouldn't say.I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.Now I need a place to hide away.Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why he had to go, I don't know, he wouldn't say.I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.Now I need a place to hide away.Oh, I believe in yesterday.

I looked over at Colton and mouthed the words "wow" She stood there with a small smile. "Welcome to the band Aurora." I say. Her smile gets a little bigger.
"I think that we could be two leads. Does that make sense?" I say. "Totally." Aurora smiles. "I'm so excited. I really want to beat Jocelyn!" She smiles but states "I heard about the fight thingy in the sophomore hallway." I looked at her kind of upset. "It's ok." I looked down at my feet.
We stayed quiet for a while. The boys had gone to get pizza letting Aurora and I hang out. "I thought it was really brave of you." She stated. "No one has ever really stood up to them." I smiled and said "Yeah but I almost got a concussion from stupid Jocelyn." "Don't sweat it were gonna beat her." Aurora reassured.
"Hey you wanna practice a song?" I asked her. "Yeah." She said in her monotone voice. It was weird how she had no emotion yet she sang amazing. "How about Fight Song?" She asked. I nodded. I didn't really listen to a lot of music from this generation, but I actually knew this song.

Like a small boatOn the oceanSending big wavesInto motionLike how a single wordCan make a heart openI might only have one matchBut I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't sayWrecking balls inside my brainI will scream them loud tonightCan you hear my voice this time
This is my fight songTake back my life songProve I'm alright songMy power's turned onStarting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight songAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleepEverybody's worried about meIn too deepSay I'm in too deep (in too deep)And it's been two yearsI miss my homeBut there's a fire burning in my bonesAnd I still believeYeah I still believe
And all those things I didn't sayWrecking balls inside my brainI will scream them loud tonightCan you hear my voice this time
This is my fight songTake back my life songProve I'm alright songMy power's turned onStarting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight songAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
