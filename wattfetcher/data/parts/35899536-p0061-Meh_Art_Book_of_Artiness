Umm.... wanted to try adding blood to something and.... this happened. FrostForest, if I got anything wrong just tell me. I have NO PROBLEM with redoing something. If it is to bloody, just tell me and I can remove some or all of it. Oh yeah, @RubyShard! I finally used a layer! WHOO! I actually enjoyed drawing this one. Ok, time for me to stop being a procrastinator and get onto the other request...

Time: 5 hours (I think)
Program: IbisPaint
