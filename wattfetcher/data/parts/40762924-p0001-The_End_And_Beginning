So I got up at a 9:30 which is early I remembered that I needed to bake so I made blue cupcakes with blue icing (dedicated to Mystorymylife_ ) . I tyred one and it was nice. so I got into my uniform and went down.        I saw Cora and Heather down there, Heather had a cake and Cora had cookies (soft but nice) then Rachel came and we brought the gear to our stall place, once we finished Cora, Heather and the others were told to go off. We went to Supervalu and got rolls. Then we sold stuff and then we went to "Bobs Casino" I won â‚¬10 in 5c coins, then we played paranoid in the playground. I left to go home.
