Basically in this, Patrick was like the dorky and nerdy kid in highschool, and Pete used to pick on him (being the cool punk kid or whatever), but later on in life, they meet again, and Patrick is now a model and he's really hot and Pete falls in love with him...
So yeah.
Sound good?
God, why am I starting YET ANOTHER FIC?!?!?
I love you lovely llamas!
