"But, knowing the truth, I also understand my brother's decision. I can't just tell you something that he's so desperate to hide." Romano said sadly, stroking his brother's hair.


England clicked his tongue and spoke, "But this isn't only about him! Other people's lives are at stake! This doesn't involve just us countries. There's a girl named ______ in this mansion, as well! We well know that we need to get her out of here... If you won't tell us anything, what are we supposed to do now?"


Romano shook his head, eyes starting to well up again "...... Sorry. I don't know, either."


Spain placed a hand on England's shoulder. "Go easy on him. I don't know what to do, either, but you're being too harsh on Romano. Give him a break."


"Potato Head, what do you think? Should we interrogate him, or wait for him totalk when he's ready? I want your opinion." Romano stated, turning to Germany for answers.


Germany looked straight into Romano's eyes, but said nothing.


Japan tilted his head, "Germany?"


"I...I... just want him to wake up first.


More than to interrogate him or to wait...more than anything, I want him to wake up.


And then, if he wants to talk, I will listen, and if he doesn't want to talk, I won't ask him anything.


I think we should try trusting him." Germany told them, taking a shaky breath afterwards.


Prussia nodded in approval of his brother's words. "... Yeah. Even Italy has learnt a thing or two, right? When he wakes up, his opinion will be important."


"Indeed... Let's wait for him to wake up." Japan said, giving a small smile.



Germany suddenly glanced at Italy. "...Hm? Oh. W--wait!"


The rest raised their eyebrows in question.


"... He's going to wake up." Romano announced.


Russia observed the Italian. "Oh. He's awake."
