"Let's go." I said resting my head on his shoulder before smirking and kissing his neck softly.
He chuckled and I felt him squeeze my ass as he started walking to the front of the bus.
I kissed his neck again and again before I started sucking on his delicate skin.
"Als are you- don't give me a hickey!" He whined and I pulled away smiling.
"Too late."
"Little shit." He mumbled.
"Its pay back from the other day." I told him and started another one.
"Are you making another one? That's not fair- I only gave you one."
I pulled away again, "You gave me three. You put the others on my thighs." I told him went back to it.
"Yeah but no one's going to see that." He complained. I didn't say anything as I finished up that mark and started another.
"You're gonna t-turn me on like this before I go on stage?" He said as we walked into the venue.
I shrugged before finishing and pulling away with a big smile. "Yes I am." I said before actually kissing him and tangling my fingers in his hair.
"You're mean." He said as soon as I pulled away.
I rolled my eyes at him and brushed some hair from his face, "I know. And maybe later I can help you with that problem." I said looking down, "Who's gonna notice that and the hickeys first?"
"I don't know but they're going to notice and I'm going to get so much shit for it." He complained.
"Come on I like them." I said, "You can get me back later or something."
"I could do it now." He said grabbing my waist and holding me to him.
"Nope, you have to go get ready, Pierce is on and I think their set's almost over." I told him pushing him away, "You're just going to have to do it later."
"Oh no , I think the guys can wait a few minutes." He said grabbing me back and not letting me go no matter what.
"You suck."
"And swallow." He said before starting. I was so happy no one was around us right now because I had trouble trying to stay somewhat silent from this.
"So un-unfair." I moaned pulling him off me after a while, "This is all unfair."
"Now, now I could give you three." He smirked.
"No, bad Austin."
"Oh I'm not the bad one." He said and attached his lips to my neck once more.
"Babe I-I have to take pictures." I said trying to push him away. He didn't say anything but kept going, "A-Aust..."
"Oh god you two get a room!"
Austin pulled away and I looked over seeing Kellin standing there with a box in his hands.
"Shut up Kell. Don't you have something to do?" I asked and he glared at me.
"Don't tell me what to do Alan Anthony. Besides aren't you supposed to be taking pictures right now?" He demanded, "And you need to be getting ready Austin. Vic and the guys are on their last song."
"We lost track of time." Austin said, "Could you go, so I can finish?"
"Oh my god you don't do that shit where everyone can see!" He said in a grossed out voice. "And I'm going this box is heavy anyways." He muttered.
