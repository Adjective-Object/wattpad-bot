China raised a hand and asked, "What should we do?"
"I want to search for the metal pieces. I hid one somewhere on the 2nd floor. Let's search for it and then go to the 4th floor." Italy told us.
America snapped his fingers and exclaimed, "Oh! I remember that one. It's the one that you and I hid, right? I saw it when we broke the clock."
"What the hell? You should have told us yesterday!" England scolded, crossing his arms.
The blue-eyed American shook his head and explained, "... It'd have been a little dangerous if I'd told you yesterday. I... won't say who to, though."
"You mean one of us was going to die? In that case, who can go get the metal piece?" France asked, giving a troubled expression.
Spain stepped forward. "I'll go, then. If you tell me where it is, I'll go get it alone."
"I'll go, too. What are the chances the Thing is going to appear?" Romano asked, turning to his younger brother for answers.
Italy looked at him with a hesitant face, but took a deep breath and spoke honestly. "......100%."
"Heh, bring it on. Never underestimate the country of the Mafia." Romano smirked.
Italy spoke up, raising his hand, "I'm coming with you. If possible, we should go in few numbers."
"Do you mind if one more goes? I'm coming with you. It's not far from here, and I'll request reinforcements if anything comes up. And I'd be grateful if they came running to us right away." Germany said, exchanging looks with the other countries.
Russia took a seat beside Prussia and spoke, "So... five people will be too much. All right. We'll be ready to leave right away. Prussia, can you get in touch with those outside?"
"Okay. England, Canada, (Name), you'll help me." Prussia said, meeting our gazes.
America looked at the search party and explained to them, "The place is the room opposite to thefireplace room. It's supposed to be well-hidden under the carpet."
"Got it~ Sir, we're off, sir." Italy smiled and saluted as they went off to the designated room.
As they left the saferoom, a pop-up menu appeared before me.
===========
Germany's Torture level went up.Italy learned a new skill.
===========
The menu suddenly changed to display the countries who went out to retrieve a metal piece.
====================
Italy, Germany, Spain, and Romano exited the safe room and headed over to the room located at the lower-right corridor of the second floor, the one in front of the fireplace room.
As they cautiously went inside the room, they searched for a metal piece and found it under the dusty carpet.
**Found: "Piece of Metal".**
"I hid it here... I don't remember that at all." Italy said slowly as he studied the small, cold object.
Romano turned to his brother and asked, "Oh! Hey, Veneziano, where's the monster going to come from?"
"Oh, er..." Italy's eyes widened, slowly recalling something.
As if on cue, a large monster fell from above and landed with a heavy thud on the floor. It eyed the countries before it and stepped closer, causing them to clench their weapons tightly and prepare for battle.
