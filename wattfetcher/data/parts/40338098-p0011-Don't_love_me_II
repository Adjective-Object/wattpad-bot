Summerholiday.. I can't sleep.. Then I'll make a few new parts.. Third update now----------------------------------------------
He hugged me before we walked back to the hotel together. I texted Liam and said that he could go back too. Harry was texting and calling me non stop. Take the hint when I'm not answering.. I hope that Ash don't use this chance to do something stupid.. When we got to the lobby we walked straight to our rooms. Harry texted me again "please answer me babe.. I'm coming up in 5 x" "okay, see you then x" I answered him and layed my phone away. I opened the window and layed down on the bed. It was so warm in here and I felt so sick by being here. I took of my sweatpants and layed them on the floor. Goooooood.. I can't understand that Niall called me beautiful when I was wearing this.. Sweatpants and a tshirt. Okay. Soon Harry got in and saw me. He just smiled and walked over to me. He layed down next to me and kissed my forehead. "I'm sorry for that earlier. I didn't mean to say that.." He said and looked at me. "You told him to kill himself.. How childish are you Harry? Never do that!" I answered him and turned around. I could feel him getting closer to me. I liked it so I didn't move away from him. "How could you?" I asked calm still not looking at him. "It was a mistake and I will never do it again!" He said. I took a deep breath and turned around again. "I hope you don't.. I love you Harry" I said and smiled. "I love you too May" he said and kissed me slowly but perfect. That night we just cuddled. I loved it. -12.30 am-Niall was getting back to our room and layed down next to me. He had been practising with the boys. Their first show was tomorrow. I can't wait to see them live again
