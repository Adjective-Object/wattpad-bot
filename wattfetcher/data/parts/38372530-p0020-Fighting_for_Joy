Hey yall, as you all know I'm ALWAYS writing and up to new books and I was writing for a new book, it's still in the works so it won't be out for a while, and I wanted to know for one, what would yall like to see as far as characters and also plots and themes. I'm obviously considered a 'plus size writer' but I'm willing to try new things as long as I can relate in someway because as you know by now, all of my books have an underlying message. Feel free to Direct Message or comment to me about anything in particular you'd like to see but please know that I always take what you all have to say and would like to see seriously so just let me know what characters you'd like to see and also what plot or theme you'd like for me to portray for those who were asking in my dms (a lot of yall) I don't think I can pull off a 'one shot' book lol. Thank you all for your time and consideration.
Happy Mother's Day to all the mommies!
