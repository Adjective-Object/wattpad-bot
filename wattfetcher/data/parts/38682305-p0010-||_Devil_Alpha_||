|| READ AUTHORS NOTE AT THE END!!!||Maria P.O.VMy throat burned as I tried to scream for help but they all came out as muffled sounds. I leaned back into the hard wood chair, my legs felt like something was holding them together. I looked down at my legs tied down to the legs of the chair. A large chain was wrapped around my stomach that connected to a large white pole.  Blood was splattered across it which made my stomach turn. I tried to shift or use some of my wolf strength many times but something was stopping me. I tried to talk to Monica, but the "wall" was between us again.  The only thing I could think of was Luke, please Luke. If you want to make up for what you did, please help me. I closed my eyes as I heard a door open.    "Wake up! ", the voice spat. I slowly opened my eyes, not wanting to be faced with the man who put me in this position. He had large bags under his eyes, his beard went down his cheek bones. His eyebrow piercing stood out, but he still looked so familiar, he looked like my mom. Oh god no. He can't be! No.      "Michael?", I whispered. He turned around, "what did you just call me?"No, now I'm gonna get killed because I thought he was  Michael. My oldest brother that was kidnapped.   He looks at me hard,     "Maria? No you can't be? Maria's dead.---- he paused looking at me he scanned my face until he seen my legs. He got down and looked at my left thigh, he ran his finger over my birth mark.     "MARIA? OH GOD I THOUGHT YOU WHERE DEAD!! OH GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?", he says as he paces still not taking the chains of my stomach or untying me.           "Maria where are you?", a voice in my head said, sounding a lot like, Luke. Crap! Luke! â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢AUTHORS NOTE:Idk how to end this chapter! Double update, yay cupcakes!!
