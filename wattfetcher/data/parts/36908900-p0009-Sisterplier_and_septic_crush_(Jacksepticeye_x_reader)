Mark's POVWe drove to the alley we were told to meet at. And there we see Y/n all tired out she was tied up and bruised jack ran up to her after jumping out of the car "Babe Y/n... I mean Y/n..." he said running up to her untieing her or at least trying till some guy came up behind us "I see you found your lovely one, I had my fun with her..." he smiled and laughed an evil type of laugh he walked over to her jack stepped back "Didnt we?" He swipe his hand across her face and onto her leg she started crying "Dont touch her!" Jack yelled "oh shh shh shhh Jack..." he said putting his finger to his lips he grinned "here you can have her... if you have my money" he put out his hand I handed him the cash he untied Y/n and tossed her over to jack she cried in his arms he tried to calm her down. "I dont want her anymore, I had my fun with her... too bad you cant take  her virginity though...." he laughed and ran down the alley way "so long bastards" he laughed evilly. We took Y/n in the car she fell asleep on Jacks lap him running his hands through her hair "Mark?" He looked up "Yes jack?" He cleared his throat "May...May I date your sister?" He struggled to say I nodded "yes you can jack you helped me get her just hurt her ill hurt you" I said in my deep narrator voice. He laughed "Thanks Mark and I wont hurt her because Markimoo is scary" he said in his childish type of voice we laughed I am glad we can still act childish with each other after what I had done "I am sorry I choked you.." he laughed "its okay buddy. You were only protecting your sister" I nodded.
