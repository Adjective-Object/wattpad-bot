Jake was watching Sky sleep, as creepy as that sounded. After tonight's confession, everything was clear. But then why did Jake feel like something was missing, that something didn't seem right? Was it because Sky let him find her so easily? The way Night talked didn't seem like she wanted to be exposed. Or was it the fact that Sky just didn't seem to be the person to pull an act like that. He was awake when his phone dinged, signalling that he received a message. He rubbed his eyes, wondering who would send him a message at this time of the night. His eyes shot up in confusion, as he read the name of the sender. 'Brielli' was the name he had given Abrielle when they were both little, and when Jake had liked her. Looking back to it, the idea made him laugh. It was Abrielle, for Christ's sake, the idea of him having a crush on her was absurd. His eyes widened, when he read the message. Her words were really familiar to the girl's he has spent almost three months talking to.
Sender: Brielli
To: Jake
They asked me why I couldn't let go of you, the thought of you. The thing is nothing makes me happier than you, and nothing makes me sadder than you.
