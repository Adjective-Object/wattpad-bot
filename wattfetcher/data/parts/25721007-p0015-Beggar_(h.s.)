My heart was beating rapidly as Harry's eyes darkened. His eyes scanned my body and I looked at my bare feet. I know he'll notice me wearing his shirt.
I'm not sure what is to come. Will he yell at me? Or switch to his random nice phase? Harry is like a bomb. You never know if he's going to explode and when he does, it's when you least expect it.
"You're.. You're wearing my shirt?" He softened and his tone was almost a whisper. I nodded and tilted my head back down.
But he wasn't having it. His fingers lifted up my chin towards him and asked, "Why?"
"I.. You smell good," I winced waiting for one of his snarky remarks. I can't think of a good reason why I did it.
"You wear it better than me," he chuckled and I looked back up at him in utter shock. Another rare compliment from the Harry Styles.
"Go back to bed. You look tired," he smiled and I nodded.
I turned on my heel and patted to his room. Harry is so complex.
I laid back down on his bed, embracing the faded scent of him,And before I knew it, I was asleep once again.

Today is Saturday so I figured I would do a little bit of job hunting. I feel like I'm taking advantage of their home and not doing anything to help. Maybe it's just me.
I threw on a hoodie and a pair of skinny jeans.
"Where are you going?" Harry groggily asked. Was he awake this whole time?
"I'm going to apply for some jobs," I chirped. And he frowned.
"Why?"
"I want to help," I shrugged my shoulders and he stayed silent. I took that as a signal to go, which I did.
On the way out, I grabbed a chocolate chip granola bar and a bottle of water. It was almost afternoon, but I didn't expect the boys to be awake since the party was last night.
Soon as I stepped foot out the door, I realized I didn't have a car. It's freezing, but I'll just have to deal with it. Everything in New York is close distance anyway.
The first place I applied to is Forever 21. When I was homeless, I remember always wanting to shop there. It always looked so extravagant. Maybe it was just me.
I was on my way to Starbucks until the familiar, rough voice behind me stopped me in my tracks.
"Well.. well.. well," I winced just knowing who I was, "Look who it is, the worthless bum now a beautiful bitch."
I cursed under my breath. Why does he always have to show up at the worse times? Where is Harry when I actually need him?
"Ya know, your little boy toy can't save you from everything," he cackled. I felt like crawling in a corner and crying.
"What do you want Brock?" I asked in pure disgust. I turned to face him. He smiled, yellow teeth in clear view. I squinted.
"You know exactly what I want Lennon," his brown eyes were dancing with amusement.
"I'm not working for you again," I hissed.
He laughed, "And why's that? You know it was good money. You were one of our best."
"I had to lose something so precious to me, to a complete stranger," I could feel the water brimming at my eyes.
"I didn't know you felt that way, Lennon.." Brock almost whispered and his eyes softened.
