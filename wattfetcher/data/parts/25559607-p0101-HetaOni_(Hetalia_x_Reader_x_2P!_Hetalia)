"Why....Why do you guys need to kill them, anyway?" I asked.
Allen took a step forward, "Doll, they're not the only ones who suffered a shitty time here. We had a fucked up life, too, because of them. It's only fair to return the favour."
2P! China...or Wang, blew smoke from his pipe and spoke, "He's right. They're the ones that banished us. Time for us to banish them."
"Banish them permanently from this world, honey~" A peppy Italian said. This must be Flavio, or 2P! Romano.
I was confused and had no idea what they were talking about. "Banished? I don't understand..."
"Hnh. There are a lot of things you wouldn't understand. You may know a few things about us, but that's just it. You don't know everything. In my opinion, it looks like you don't even know how to actually get yourselves out of this mansion. Just accept defeat, already." Kuro told me while he was polishing his katana.
Oliver clapped his hands together. "Well! Why don't we save that for later and just get this show on the road now?~"
I fidgeted in my place. "I...I can't help you guys kill them. I won't do it."
Luciano looked at me and spoke, "You've got it wrong, ragazza. You won't be the one killing them. Leave that to us and our friends. For now, just getting you away from them is enough. We can't risk you giving them stuff that'll give them back their strength or ability to fight again. We'll think about strategy later. Right now..."
"We'll leave it to my ol' buddy to take care of the useless and troublesome version of Italy, here." Allen said, his thumb pointing at Luciano.
I tilted my head in puzzlement. "....your 'buddy'..?"
Allen gave a laugh, the others joining him.
"Yeah, doll. My buddy."
".....Who's..that..?"
"......Steve."
