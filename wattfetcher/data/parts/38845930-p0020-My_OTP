Jordan's POV
Erin and I have our one year aniversary coming up soon and I wanted to do something really special, so I got her a single rose and a necklace with a ring on it that said our names.
"Jordan, oh my gosh. Thank you." She said when she saw what I got her.
"Oh, you're welcome." I said before kissing her.
"Oh my g -- Erin." I said when she handed me a key to her house on a picture of us that connects to a keychain.
"Now you can come anytime you want, even if I'm not home." She said.
"Well this tops my gift." I said.
"No, I love it." She said as she handed me the necklace to put around her neck.
"No, it's crap compared to a key to your house." I said.
Erin was going to spend the night at my house.
Erin's POV
Jordan got me the cutest thing ever, he got me a necklace with our names on it and I am never taking it off.
We decided to finish editing the video and post it.
"1000 views already?" He said about a half hour after we uploaded it.
"Holy crap." I said.
"Aureysparklez is cannon!" One of the viewers said in the comments.
"You've been together for a while, it took you this long to upload?" Another said.
"Jordan!" I cried when I saw one of the comments saying we were always perfect for each other.
"Aww, Erin." He said while hugging me and rubbing my arms.
"They don't care, why did I think they would hate us together?" I asked.
"I -- Aww, I don't know." He said.
"I love you." I said into his chest.
"I love you." He said after kissing my head.
