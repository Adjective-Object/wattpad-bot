"Come in." I told the nurse and the girls at the door as they knocked on the hospital door.
"How you feeling?" The nurse asked me. She had the incubator my baby is in covered up so that neither me or anyone else could see him or her.
"I'm feeling well. A little bit of pain." I shrugged.
"That's great mommy." She smiled. "Are you ready?" She asked and I shook my head.
"My husband went to go get his camera." I told her and she nodded.
"Your husband seems great. He was so worried and when everyone tried to get him to see the baby he said no everytime. He kept saying he wanted to witness that moment with you, together." She said smiling.
"Yeah. I feel like such a lucky girl." I told her and she smiled.
"You are. Your family is gorgeous." She said and smiled. "I'm sorry, I'm being weird. I'm Doctor Palmer." She said and shook my hand
"Lauren. But you probably already know that." I chuckled.
"I did Mrs. Carter." She smiled and I laughed.
"Mrs. Thomas. I was waiting until my license expired to change it on my license. The lines are always large at the DMV." I said and she nodded.
"Oh I'm sorry, I should have checked your medical records." She shook her head.
"It's fine." I told her and Devin came back in the room.
"Oh baby is in the room." He chuckled and I smiled.
"Alright mommy, daddy are you ready?" Dr. Palmer asked and I nodded eagerly.
She took off the blanket over the baby and there he lay. I couldn't help but cry, seeing that the baby was in fact a boy.
As I cried Devin went to pick him up and placed him into my arms. I sniffed my babies skin and he smells so cute. New born baby scent.
I snuggled his little body in my arms. It was like he knows it's me his mama. Although he is swaddled, he's looking at me so intently. I couldn't help but kiss him and kiss him again and again. Baby boy is too cute.
"Can I hold him?" Devin asked after a little more time with him.
"I'm sorry." I laughed. "Look at me already hogging the baby."
"Nah. This is my little man." He said. "It's gonna be us in the man cave. Popping bottles of similac on ice."
I laughed. "None of that for my baby boy."I said.
"Speaking of food, he's had his last meal a few hours ago. Would you like to learn how to breastfeed?" She asked and I nodded.
She instructed me on how to feed him, and I held him in the position she had at first wanted to try. She said it worked best with premature babies.
"He's not latching." I told her and she nodded.
"This usually happens when babies eat from bottles before they get breastfed. It's nothing wrong with that. Just be patient with little man. Let's try this again." She said and she instructed me to do a method where my breast was out completely, as opposed to me being covered up.
"I hope this works. He needs to eat." I said.
She nodded. "He does. He's 5 pounds 11 ounces 17 inches." She recited and I nodded.
"We gotta get my baby boy eating. Mama wants you to eat eat." I cooed and I looked down at him, as he sat against my nipple not budging.
