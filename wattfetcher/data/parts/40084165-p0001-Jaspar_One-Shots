"Shut up, Caspy." Joe said, returning his gaze to his smartphone, scrolling through the youtube tag on tumblr.
"You've been on the site all day and I want to take you to dinner." Caspar whined, begging for a scrap of attention from his boyfriend. Joe rolled his eyes. He didn't particularly feel like going through the effort of getting ready. "No, Caspar, I told you, I don't-" he was interrupted by Caspar yanking the phone from his hands and walking into the kitchen.
"What are you doing with that, give it back!" Joe yelled, jumping in attempt to take the smartphone back from Caspar to no avail. Height difference sucks, Joe thought as Caspar slid the phone on top of the refrigerator.
"Dammit, I want my phone!" "Gotta kiss me first." Caspar said, a smirk playing across his face.
Joe rolled his eyes and leaned in, kissing Caspar softly. "Can I have my phone now?" he asked.
Caspar smiled. "Not a chance." he scooped Joe up and ran out the door, setting him down in the passenger's seat of the car and driving off.
"Where are you taking me?" Joe asked, slightly angry about the situation.
"Dinner." Caspar said, pulling into the driveway of Joe's favorite restaurant, Chipotle.
After the meal, Joe looked up at Caspar. "You know what, love, this is better than any post on tumblr." Caspar smiled. "I know."
