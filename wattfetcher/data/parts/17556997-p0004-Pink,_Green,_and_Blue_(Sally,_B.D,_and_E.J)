Masky cleared his throat a bit as we stopped hugging. Hoodie walked over to where Masky was as they stood beside each other.
"So what have you two been up to?" I asked as I grabbed my purse from the ground.
"Nothing really...." Masky answered.
"Yeah just some packing. That's all!" Hoodie said.
Masky nudged Hoodie in the shoulder a little bit hard, telling him to stop talking. Hoodie shrugged in response.
"Packing? Packing for what?" I asked; confused.
"Well," Masky said. "Let's just get back to the house first..."
I just shrugged and went along with it. I knew that they would tell me eventually. Masky and Hoodie never lied to me unless it was really necessary. I took their arms and got in between them as we walked down the usual trail to the house.
I like Masky and Hoodie. I've known them since I was little. They are very nice and sweet and home schooled me til I was 12. Even though they may look a bit strange, they're still pretty nice. Although it does get kinda annoying when they call me "Miss Jessica". Sure, they work for my dad, but that doesn't make me any less different.
We finally made it to the house and got inside. Hoodie closed the door behind me as Masky hung up my jacket for me. I wanted to object, but he insisted. I glanced over to the couch, to see Smile Dog and Ticci Toby, sitting there. I walked over to the couch as Masky and Hoodie walked into the kitchen to get cheesecake. They really like cheesecake.
"Hello Smile! Hey Toby!" I greeted them as I sat right next to them.
"Sup!" Toby greeted me back.
I rolled my eyes as I petted Smile's head as he began to wag his tail. Toby had brown hair, wears a grayish hoodie (what seams like a hoodie to me) with dark gray stripes on the sleeves. He also wears yellow goggles and something on his mouth that gives him some sort of smile. He likes hatchets, pancakes, waffles, and he twitches a lot.
Masky and Hoodie came back with a plate full of cheesecake as they walked over to the couch.
"So......what's this about packing?" I asked; wanting to know what was going on.
Masky and Hoodie both exchanged looks with each other, even though they couldn't make face expressions with their masks on. Masky and Hoodie both looked at me again.
"We have to tell you something....." Masky started.
"Okay. What is it?
"Well you see," Hoodie continued. " Us, your father, and your brother....... are going to be gone for a while...."
"What? For how long?"
"A-About a week....S-Starting t-today." Toby answered.
Now I understood why Jeff and Dad didn't come out yet to greet me from school. But then I remembered about Jane. Where was she?
"Well, what about Jane?"
"Jane says that she had to go somewhere to speak to an old friend.....and won't be back for a week......." Masky replied.
"Well, why do you guys have you leave?"
"Important business to take care of that requires all of us." Hoodie answered.
I didn't understand what was so important that they all had to leave. I groaned. "Does that mean I'll have to be here all by myself?"
"No. You're going to get 3 others to protect you while we're gone." Toby replied.
