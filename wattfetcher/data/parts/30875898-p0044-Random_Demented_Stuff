When recovery is so far away, I can't even look
Like the very first page of a thousand page book
And determination has left me for dead
Like a runaway bride that was supposed to be-wed
When life has left me high and dry
And it leaves me in my room to think and cry
About the entire bottle of pills I took
This is what happens,
When recovery is so far away, I can't even look
