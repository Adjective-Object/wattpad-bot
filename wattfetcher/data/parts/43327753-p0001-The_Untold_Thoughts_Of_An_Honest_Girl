I breathed my last breath into you.We detached our lips easily like a mother forced to leave her child.
I breathed my last breath into you. We untangled our intertwined minds painlessly like needles piercing into our hearts.
I breathed my last breath into you.We striped away our emotions effortlessly like concurring the world in one moon.
I breathed my last breath into you.We remembered the memory of birth so clearly like seeing ourselves in muds reflection.
I breathed my last breath into you and watched you cough it out like the smoke of a cigarette as water filled us both to our brims.
I breathed my last breath into you as god breathed the last breath out of us.
