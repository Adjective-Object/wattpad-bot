I followed after him, "Alan please!"
"No, not now Austin. I'm busy."
"Well can we talk later?" I asked desperate.
"I don't know because I really don't even want to be around you right now."
"Please? I really need to talk to you, I need to explain."
He sighed, "Fine, fine."
I grinned, "Thank you!"
"But we're not talking until I'm done. I have pictures to take." He said before walking away.
I watched him walk away before going back to the guys.
"So, what'd he say?"
"We can talk later." I said, "He's gonna let me explain."
"That's good." Tino said.
"Yeah, yeah I know." I said and sat down next to Phil.  About an hour or so later it was us on stage. After we played I felt so much better, I had gotten all of my stress and anger out on stage. It was great.
"That was a fucking great show." Aaron said handing his bass to stage crew.
"It really was, you sounded great." I told him grabbing a water and downed it quickly.
"I know I did."
"Don't get cocky." I said throwing my now empty bottle at him.
"Rude."
"I know." I said before seeing the familiar ginger walking over and talking to Tony, "Guys I got to go."
"Right, right your talk with Alan." Tino said, "Go."
"Wish me luck." I said before walking over to Tony and Alan.
"Hey Austin." Tony said, "Killer set."
"Thanks man, you guys were great too."
"Thanks."
"Yeah. Alan can we go talk now?"
"I'm talking to Tony right now."
"Oh no it's cool I had to go talk to our guitar tech anyways." He said before leaving us alone.
"Well lets go talk then."
"Do you wanna talk here or back at the bus?" I asked.
"Anywhere is fine. Lets just get this done."
"Okay fine we'll just talk here then." I said and Alan rolled his eyes.
"Will you just talk?" He asked annoyed.
"If you're just going to be pissy about it then what's the point in trying to explain it."
"I don't know you're the one who wanted to talk." He said, "So talk, explain try to make whatever point you want to make. Just say it Austin."
"You know what? Never mind!" I said, "God you're infuriating!"
"How am I infuriating!? I didn't do anything to you! I wasn't even trying to do anything with you! You were the one coming after me and I find out you just wanted to get in my pants?"
"That's not all I was trying to do." I said exasperated, "I really like you okay? Yeah at first I just wanted to fuck you because I thought you were hot. I mean I still think you're hot but then I started to get to know you and shit Alan. Why do you think I was being so awkward earlier? What would you do if the guy you liked started talking about how he definitely didn't like you? It's really fucking awkward."
