(*Shays P.O.V*)
Today is the first day of 11th grade and I'm going to a new school called Clairemont High. Oh ya I'm Shay and I'm 16 years old. My real name is Shabree but I don't like that name its to girly. I just moved up to San Diego from New York so this should be fun. But I do have a dark past which I don't want to talk about but let's say that I did self harm and thats all I'm going to say.(*introduction over*)I wake up to my alarm screaming in my ear. I sat up and looked at the clock 5:30a.m the clock read. "Five more minutes." I said while hitting the snooze button. I gently lay my head back down and doze off.(5 minutes later)I sat up quickly and turned my alarm off. I stretch my body and flop out of bed. I walk up to my desk and sat down. I looked at myself in the mirror "I look horrible." I said rubbing my eyes. I plug in my straightener and turn it on. I grab my makeup bag and put on my foundation. Then I put on my eyeliner into a big cat eye then put on loads of massacra. I contour just a little bit and then put on lip balm. I look at myself in the mirror and smirked. " I don't look have bad". I picked up my brush and brushed my hair I flipped my bangs to the side and started straightening my hair. It didn't take that long to straighten my dark black hair. I put some hair spary on my bangs and went to my closet. I put on a black tank top and a red flannel. I put on a pair on leggings and my black vans on too. I opened my door and walk downstairs I could smell the fresh bacon from the stairs. I went and sat at the table with my little brother and my mom while my dad was cooking. I took some bacon on my plate and started eating while my little brother was eating cereal. My mom puts down her phone and asked "Can you walk to school I have early business meeting." I looked at her and said "I always walk to school so what does it matter." She rolled her eyes and walked out the front door. My dad sat down and started staring at me. "What?" I said with bacon stuffed in my mouth. "Now you know your mother works hard to keep food on the table you should treat her likw you treat me... respectfully." I sat down my bacon and leaned back in my chair and said "Your never home either and I treat you the same." Then I got up and grabbed my bag and headed out the door.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~AUTHOR'S NOTEThank you all for reading this is you guys have comments of what i should do in the next chapter that would be great. :* :*
