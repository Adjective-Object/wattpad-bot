Erin's POV
I loved that comment so much, I thought of it until we were going to bed.
"What if we were to... get married?" I asked.
"Okay. It's only been a year, not yet." He said.
"You thought I meant it. I meant, if we were to get married, what would we do?" I asked.
"I don't know." He said with fear in his eyes.
"What?" I asked.
"I -- do you want to -- ?" He said before I cut him off.
"No! Oh my god, sorry. I mean. It's not like I would never marry you, but I just -- no, not now." I said.
"Okay. Well, I would marry you eventually, maybe... I -- sorry." He said.
I laughed awkwardly and lied my head back down on his shoulder.
"Okay." I said.
"I love you." He said as he squeezed me.
"Love you." I said.
"But, what if we did?" He asked.
"Jordan." I chuckled.
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't know." He responded.
Jordan's POV
Erin fell asleep laying on my arm and shoulder. She was grabbing my hand like I was gonna leave and she didn't want me too. The look on her face of sheer joy and love made me hold her hand so tight that she tried to let go.
"Jordan?" She asked half asleep.
"Yeah, I'm here." I said.
"Okay, okay. Yeah, okay." She said while falling asleep again. She repositioned so she was on my shoulder and holding my waist.
"You're so freakin' cute." I said before kissing her head and closing my eyes.
When I woke up, Erin had hidden her face in the blanket. I noticed she was curled up in a ball like she was cold, so I gave her more blanket and sat up. She tried to grab me but I wasn't there so she gasped and sprung up about to cry.
"Baby?" I asked.
"I thought you left. You scared me, Jordan." She said.
"No, I'm still here." I said before kissing her forehead.
"Hmm." She said.
"Good morning." I said.
"Hmm." She said again.
"Are you too tired too talk anymore?"
"Mmm hmm." She said while reaching for my hand.
"I love you." I said.
"Mmm hmm." She said from her sleep. She's so cute when she wakes up. It was only about 6:30 so I decided to get some more sleep.
