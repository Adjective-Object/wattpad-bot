When I entered the training room, I saw Dr.Ali and Mr.Arnold talking in hushed tones. Nobody told me eavesdropping was wrong. I thought to myself.
So I listened.
"I tried so hard. She never got it in the middle. All vampires have the natural ability of aiming, why can't she?"
"I am sorry Mr.Arnold but Rose is my first H.V student, it will be hard to communicate with her, you have to try with her. Remember, an H.V have their potential powers in their feelings, they don't rely on blood for powers like other breeds, they rely on their feelings and desires, I am pretty sure there's something bugging her."
"Why didn't you tell me this information, from before I chose her?" He groaned in annoyance, I hated Mr.Arnold's way of reacting to this. I didn't understand most of what they were saying. I may not know much. But I know that as our teacher, there should be some sort of care.
I wasn't in the mood to listen to their conversations anymore and decided to get back to the dorms.
I entered the my room, just after I closed the door, I got a flashback of today.
My igronance.
My irritation.
My loneliness.
My fears.
My very being.
What have I done to deserve this?
