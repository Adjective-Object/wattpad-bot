I began to climb up the stairs and smiled at the bus driver, I turned and faced the bus, millions of little eyes stared at me. I began to walk down the aisle looking for an empty seat."Hey, come sit next to me," a voice from the back called I looked over and saw a boy my age wave his hand over towards me, I smiled and sat down next to him."Thanks," I said"No prob," he replied. An awkward silence stretched across us"So what's your name," the boy said as he scratched is head."Francesca, what's yours?" "Eli, who do you have for homeroom,""Uh..." I trailed off, I forgot who so I decided to pull out the piece of paper that had my classes and showed it to him."No way, we have the same classes!" Eli said as his eyes lighted up. Eli had dark brown hair with brown eyes and pale skin, his hair was really thick and had some orange highlights, a pretty neat combination. I smiled, looks like I made a friend after all. The bus pulled up to a large building which I guess is the school, it looked exactly like Russian head quarters, I tensed up"Hey it's going to be alright, it's my first day too, we can do it together," Eli said, I turned and looked at him, he had a small grin and was looking directly at me."Ok," I responded, and we began to head off of the bus.
