The bell went and I gathered my things and prepared to meet Tyler's friends.
He smiled at me, grabbed my hand and began to drag me through the mounds of people.
We eventually arrived at a little corridor wich would have looked almost abandoned if it weren't for the people sitting, laughing and eating.
*twitch*
"Hey guys this is my new friend Jacey!" Tyler called out into the corridor.
They all looked over and most of them smiled except one girl.
She looked kind of intimidating.
*twitch*
With her fuzzy Blonde hair and ice blue eyes.
She just looked at me and snarled.
*twitch*
"Hi Jacey I'm Charlie but most people just call me Charles!" One boy introduced
"Yeah and I'm Amelia!" Another girl called
A bunch of names were thrown at me until the scary girl introduced herself.
All she said was, 'Bec'.
*twitch*
I'm guessing that's her name....
"Come sit!" Tyler said.
I sat down in the semi-dark corridor and began to eat my fantales.
They are my heroin.
"Are they fantales?" Amelia asked.
"Yeah" I said shyly.
*twitch*
"Omg they are my favorite lolly ever!" She stated.
"Oh, want some, I have a whole packet." I giggled
"For sure." She sassed.
We continued eating my fantales until Charles suggested we play truth or dare.
"Amelia truth or dare?" Charles asked evilly
"Dare" she challenged.
*twitch*
After a long pause Charles continued.
"I dare you to kiss Jacey on the lips" He laughed
I didn't mind she was hot enough.
I've always been into blondes.
"You up for it?" She asked sexually
*twitch*
"It's just a kiss" I shrugged.
She leaned in and I did to.
All the boys watched in awe as our lips touched.
It was just a peck.
*twitch*
It lasted all of 3 seconds and the boys still sat in awe.
"Hellooo!" Amelia clicked in their faces.
They all snapped out of it and Tyler looked down.
He was embarrassed, cute.
*twitch*
"Jacey truth or dare?" Amelia asked as she placed one of the fantales in her mouth.
"Truth." I said nervously
