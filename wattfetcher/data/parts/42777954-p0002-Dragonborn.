The kitchen was full of oily smoke as the Dunmer help hurried about, preparing breads and soups for the coming dinner. Mareo, the head chef looked down on her with disdain as she hurried by him with her serving cart covered in dishes."Hurry up out of my kitchen girl, or I'll do you worse than that little scratch."The dark elves treated her almost as badly as the high elves; it was as if the serving Mer in her master's household treated her as they did in order to retain some sort of dignity after being driven from their homeland during the eruption of Red Mountain. This did not garner any sympathy or forgiveness from the young orphaned Nord. And in her young heart she was beginning to loathe the pointed ear race in its entirety. The only exception to this loathing was a singular wood elf whose entire family had been wiped out during one of the Altmer's many purges of Valenwood. He was as much a slave to the Thalmor as she was, slaving as a stable hand. She occasionally snuck him scraps from the larder and in return he helped her master her swordplay, both of them practicing with wooden poles long after the masters had gone off to bed. These sessions had earlier on left both of them bruised and exhausted, but Katya had made much progress and in the recent days her prowess with a wooden pole was impressive.It was to him that she ran that night, slipping out of her berth in a cranny of the kitchens. Katya was as light-footed as a Khajjit and as silent as a mouse as she hurried along the servant's passageways. It wasn't long before she reached the heavy oaken door and broke into the bright light of the full moons. The slender girl kept skillfully to the shadows, freezing if a guard happened to glance in her direction. No one stopped her and she made it to the stables in record time.Anson was waiting for her at the door, his nutty-yellow skin glowing in the moonlight. At sight of her he beckoned her into the pitch darkness of the stables, the torches had been extinguished earlier in the night. A practice that Loxias had begun many years ago to dissuade horse thieves. Unlike most Elvin lords he preferred human steeds to elf ones, and so his stables were full of the finest Nordic, and Cyrodilic steeds, there were even a couple of sturdy Breton ponies in his collection. The smells of hay and sweet feed were comforting to Katya and she breathed deeply the scents as she followed behind Anson, towards his sleeping quarters in the loft."We cannot do our practice this evening." Anson whispered into the dark, his palm glowing with a greenish light that illuminated the loft quite eerily. The elf's face was a mask of worry mixed with strange exultation.Katya cocked her head picking up immediately on her friend's odd mood, "What is it Anson? Is there something wrong?"Anson grinned and shook his head, "No, in fact everything is terrific. Let me explain.""Please.""I was called up to see Loxias's wife. She wanted to talk about bringing in some new steeds, a couple of mares from Solitude in Skyrim, and a stallion from High Rock. Anyways, I took the long way out. Through the old armoury." He grinned, and held up his palm in a placating gesture at Katya's troubled expression "No one saw me. No one goes through there anymore at all. But they had left some things behind when they moved it all to the new armoury. I managed to sneak a couple of things out."Katya was excited by the idea, but still she was anxious. Stealing from Loxias was an offence punishable by public execution. "Anson. What if they find out?"Anson shook his head, his grin growing even larger, "It won't matter, because if they find out we'll be long gone and far-away."Katya's heart sped up and her eyes grew wide. "Are we going to do it then? Are we going to leave this place?""Aye. I've got a supply of stores put back, mostly grain and apples from the horses, but also a couple of water-skins that I'll fill up tomorrow. We'll leave tomorrow night; the Cyrodilic blood-mares will be perfect for it. They're young and fleet and take the bit well."The young Nord laughed and hugged Anson impulsively, feeling the happiest that she had ever been, and the most excited. Anson hugged her back and then released her,"Now, look at what I've managed to find for us."From under the straw of his makeshift bed he produced a pair of elven blades, single hand weapons with gold-green blades and hilts of polished moonstone."They're beautiful." Katya breathed, entranced by the gleaming metal.Anson nodded briefly, carefully hiding the weapons under his bed again. "I wish I could let you get used to their weight, but we haven't got time. They'll serve us well anyways I think. Look, Katya. You need to go back to the kitchens. Come back here tomorrow night and meet me at the far end of the stables. I'll have the horses saddled and ready to go. I need you to act like nothing is different tomorrow. Serve Elenwyn as you would any other day. This entire plan depends on it.""You can trust me Anson. I swear on the name of Talos." She crossed her heart; solemnly invoking the oath that she had always heard her father speak to bind his words.Anson grinned, "There it is, spoken like a true Nord. And soon we'll both be there in your Fatherland, free citizens once more. Run along Katya, and I'll see you tomorrow."
