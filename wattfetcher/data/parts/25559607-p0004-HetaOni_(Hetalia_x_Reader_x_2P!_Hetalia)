Italy: Aww~~ After all the trouble we had to find it? C'mon, let's just go in for a little while.
Germany: ........
========<The screen faded out and faded in to show the countries went inside the house. For reals. Sigh.. Nuu..========
Italy: It's cleaner than I thought.
Germany: H-Hey. Can we go now?
Prussia: What's the matter, West? You scared?
========
I giggled to myself. It's really fun to see a different side of countries. This wasn't really what I expected from Germany the first time I played the game. This bit still makes me give out a chuckle.
Though my giggle was replace by shock when I pressed the button again. A loud crash was heard. Since I was wearing my earphones and the volume was up pretty high, I was really surprised.========
Germany: !!
Germany: L-Look, we really should go now.
Japan: Oh, don't be silly. It's not like there are any ghosts or anything. Where is your common sense?
Prussia: Be careful, Japan!
Japan: I know. I'll just go see what happened. I'll be right back.
========I was then able to control the Japan sprite and guided him towards the kitchen. I remember the shard should be there. As I entered the kitchen, I walked over to the broken plate and pressed the button again.========
Japan: The plate is...broken. I have to be careful not to hurt myself.
Japan obtains Ceramic Shard
Then, I go back from where we started to trigger the event where Japan realises the others aren't there anymore.
Japan: !?
Japan: Did they leave, after all?
Japan: How regrettable.
========"Oh Japan. That won't be the only regrettable thing you'll experience there." I thought  to myself sadly.=========
I decided to lead the Japan sprite towards the Tatami room. I inspected some stuff and found a note.
The note reads: "Fix the piano, repair the toilet, leave the aid kit in the drawer on the second floor.
After that, I guided Japan towards the toilet area, when Steve was spotted. I chose to stay calm, because duh.  (Even though I wouldn't.) Steve then went through the door, which closed after the monster entered.
Japan: !?
Wha... What was that, just now?
I...Maybe I'm getting tired...
With that event done, I headed up the second floor and went to the room in the upper left corridor. I walked over to the bed to pick up the whip that Japan identifies as Germany's.
Japan: Is this not... Germany's whip?
What is it doing in a place like this?
Obtained: Germany's Whip.
Then I guided the Japan sprite to the room on the upper right corridor. He checks out a certain curtain and finds Germany. A very shaken Germany. Scratch that, a reaalll shaking shaken Germany.
