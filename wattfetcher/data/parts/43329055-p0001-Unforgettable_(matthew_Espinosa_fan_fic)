Savannah's pov: Me and Matt were talking to eachother threw our windows because Matt lived right Next to eachother. "Let's go for a ride on our boards" Matt said . I nodded and said "I'll meet you in five minutes outside" he nodded and winked at me. Gosh I loved it when he winked at me. It makes me smile.. I grabbed my ' you can't sit with us 💁🏽' sweat shirt and threw it on. I put my hair in a messy bun , changed into some black leggings and put on my white converse.
Matts pov:I waited for Savannah right outside of the gate. I heard a door close and a gate door open. I looked up and saw Savannah. Gosh she looked so cute. She doesn't even try to look pretty but yet she's so beautiful. "Ready?" I asked Savannah as she closed the gate door. "Yeah" she said as she layed her board on the side walk. We got on our boards and headed to the ice cream shop near by us. We stopped by the corner and walked in.
Savannah's pov : "Hey Mrs Berry" I said as a ran to give her a hug. Matthew looked at me in confusion. "Matt, you don't remember mrs berry?" I asked . Matt shook his head. " we used to come here all the time when we were kids" I said. "Ana, I'm just kidding ! I remember her !" Matt exclaimed. I laughed and Matt walked up to mrs berry and hugged her.
Matts pov:"It's been a while since we've eatin' one of the best ice cream's in town " I said smiling.Savannah looked at me and smiled. We stared at eachother for a while but got interrupted. "Okay love birds what can I get for you guys?" Mrs berry asked laughing. "I'll get the fruity mint swirl" I Said smiling. "And I'll get Oreo cream pie " Savannah said.
Savannah pov: As we walked out we thanked mrs berry and I took a look at Matt and he looked sad."Best friend what's wrong? " I asked sticking my bottom lip out."um so you know how um, I um like you, um .. FOR GODS SAKE WILK YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND !! Savannah I've been waiting for this moment for me to ask you ! I love you and will never stop loving you." Matthew said. I woke up sweating . Aw man it was just a dream 😭. I've been having a crush on matthew since we were ten . He was also my first kiss, I was his. A/n
