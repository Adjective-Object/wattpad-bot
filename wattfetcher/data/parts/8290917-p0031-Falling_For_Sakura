Sakura wanted to die rather than live through the humiliation of all seven brothers seeing her in such a state. Sebastian laid her down and Toby rushed to her, barking loudly.
"I'm fine, Toby. I'm fine," she said. Then she glanced up at Sebastian, who looked rather concerned about her well-being. She turned to Nicolas.
"Are you all right?" he asked.
"How did you get here?" Logan queried.
Darcy stood rigid, watching the scene before him, his heart thumping too hard for his liking. He bloody well didn't like the fact that his brothers were showing too much concern and interest in the girl before them. He had the urge to barge in, scoop her up in his arms, and take her far, far away. It was a stupid notion, of course, and Darcy had never been stupid.
Sakura felt her heart beating way too fast for her liking... to be surrounded by the brothers again. She hugged Toby even tighter against her chest and bit her lip. Oh God! She needed to get out of here. Now!
She hastily got up and said, "Thanks for finding my dog," and ran back the way she came.
They watched her go, unable to hide their disappointment.
"We didn't ask for her name," Conrad said.
"How did she get here wearing that?" Hayden asked no one in particular.
"She lives in the cottage just down the road, remember?" Nicolas reasoned. "Otherwise, she wouldn't be wearing..." He left the sentence unfinished because, to be honest, he couldn't come up with an explanation himself.
The brothers decided they'd had enough for the day and started to wander back to the house. Conrad picked up the thing Toby had dropped and found it was a memory stick.
"I think this belongs to her," he said to his brothers.
"We'll have to give it back," Sebastian suggested.
"Yeah." Conrad nodded, smiling broadly.
