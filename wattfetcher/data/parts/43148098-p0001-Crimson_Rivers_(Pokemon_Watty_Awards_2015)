The usual forest chatter went on as the Espeon circled her nest with five eggs in it, her eyes gleaming in the darkness. Suddenly, the Espeon looked up, and the forest fell silent. Dread began to spread through the Espeon, she sensed something bad was going to happen. The sound of the wind whistled through the trees, and a thunderclap was heard, and a flash of lightning illuminated the Eeveelution's terrified face.
Rain began pouring, and Fire-Types found cover under large rocks and underground. All the Pokèmon headed for cover.
Screams from the nearest town startled and frightened the Espeon, and she flattened her ears, hissing. It soon died down as smoke could be seen and gunshots were heard.
It seemed to be the end of humanity.
Screaming, explosions, thunder, lightning, all night long. Eventually, the Espeon fell asleep, sheltering her unborn young.
The Espeon woke up to low chatting, the Pokèmon were talking about what happened. She let the father of her nest, a Flareon, guard it while she raced to see what had happened.
The stench of blood, smoke, and death hit the wild Pokèmon as she stared at the scene. The town was in ruins, buildings crumbled and ablaze, large craters where bombs were, and dead bodies all around. Men and woman with orange outfits strutted around, shooting people if they were alive and not wearing the outfit.
The Espeon turned tail and ran back to her nest, and began dragging it further into the forest when a crack was heard and an egg rocked.
The litter was hatching.
