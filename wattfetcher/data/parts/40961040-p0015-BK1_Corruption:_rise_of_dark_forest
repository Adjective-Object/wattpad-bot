"Wake up" a ruff voice sounded as I felt stinging on the side of my face. I opened my eyes to see at least 20 people standing around me.
"Is he a wolf?" One asked. Another responded with. 'I don't know.' I groaned, I felt like shit. Everything was spinning, I found my mind drifting to Kent, what had happened? Was he OK?
One of the men stepped forward, I recognized his voice, the voice of that shadow Kent had been talking to.
"So, what are you to that wolf? Brother? Friend?" I blinked staring at him.
"Wolf?" One of the men shook their heads.
"Griff lay off, he doesn't know what were talking about." Griff told him to shutup and looked down at me. I was in chains tied to a beam of some sort, I was forced to sit down the chains around my stomach.
"So, can dark forest use him?" I saw wolves that were bigger than they should be walking in, one turned human! I mean freaking turned into a man! A naked man might I add. He quickly slipped on some boxers, his eyes glowed as he stared at me.
"I turn him, he be really strong as wolf, no?" The shifted man got nods from everyone else. He smiled.
"What are you going to do?" I was shaking, I'm pretty sure I would shit myself if I wasn't as manly as I was. :)
"This will hurt, no struggle or hurt more, no scream, you hurt ears" he said pointing to his ears. I saw his front teeth getting sharper.
"Look there." He said pointing  to my right. I did, which was stupid because it left my neck open. I felt two sharp knives dig in my neck. I almost screamed but his hand went over my mouth. Darkness took over my vision, I felt my body shutting down, this was it, I would die.
