Justin grabbed my wrist and I winced at the pain it shot up my arm I tried to hide the pain but Justin noticed and tried to roll up my sleeve but I tried to jerked my hand away and he didn't let me as he rolled it up and gasped at my cuts I could feel his glare so I turned my head but I could still feel it instead of freaking out he kissed it then rolled the sleeve back down .
" how long " he asked almost in a whisper
" four months " I sighed
" these were they from yesterday " he sighed looking at my wrist I nodded and pain feeled his eyes I knew he felt bad about it I grabbed his chin and kissed him softly
" don't worry about it I'm happy now than I have ever been " I kissed him once more
" I love you" I added
" I love you too" he whispered
" I love you more " I cheesed
" I'm not doing that sappystuff " he said then added " but that would still be impossible"
I told you everything Remember

" Justin " I screamed running from him
" quit being a baby" he teased catching me and throwing me over his shoulder and carrying me outside to the pool and out the gate and then he threw me on the trampoline then climbed in and zipped it up and cornered me I tried to make it to the zipper but he tackled me and pinned my wrist above my head then he kissed me then slowly released his grip on me and I wrapoed my arms around his neck and deepened the kiss and his hands traveled down my back when the trampoline dipped and we pulled away and Ryan had got in the trampoline and was now jumping I glared at him and so did Justin " thanks dude for ruining the moment " Justin said sitting up and tripping Ryan then everyone else got on. Chaz and Christian got on and zipped the zippered and hopped over to me a backed up and bumped into muscular arms I knew as Justin's and relaxed into him but the guys came closer then I tired to get out of Justin's grip but it didn't work. " justin let me go " I screamed as chaz starrted tickling me " chaz stop " I screamed and giggled at the same time and tried to push his hands away then Justin pushed him away and took his place hovering over me and brought his hands to my side and whispered " only I can touch you like that " I tensed up and he tickled me and I tried to tickle him back between giggles then I whispered " says who " going along with what he had said " you did by your actions babe " he whispered againist my neck then he started jumping around me so I would fall over if I tried to get up I grabbed around his ankles and he fell and I pinned him "how does it feel " I smirked " I like it pretty good " he smirked back flipping us over I frowned didn't plan on this
" I want food " Ryan complained jumping up and down
"You always want food " Chaz teased smirking
" do not " Ryan whined then they started fighting on the trampoline and Justin moved away from me and pulled them apart " ladies your both beautiful now let's get some food " Justin joked hopping off the trampoline and having Ryan and Chaz fight for who gets off first as me and christian watched in amusement chaz got off and raced for the house then me and christian walked slowly back to the house " look im sorry for the other day" christian said with sadness
" its OK I missed you " I said messing up his hair he pushed my hand away and fixed his hair
" watch the hair "he whined then added " I missed you too " he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pushed my head with his elbow in a brotherly joking way " your like my my wittle brother "I teased patting his head
