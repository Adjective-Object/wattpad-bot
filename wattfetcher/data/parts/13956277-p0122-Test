I couldn't face Karam, I closed the door of my room and burried myself under my blanket. Was I ashamed ? Or sad because Simon was leaving ... maybe I was feeling guilty for lying from the beginning.
But, after all ... who is he to punish me ? I'm 18 now ! I can do what I want ! And this is my house.
"OPEN THE DAMN DOOR" Karam shouted, I was too busy painting my nails, "I'm busy, open it by yourself" I sighed, He broke into the room like Hulk "What?" I rolled my eyes, "What what? What's wrong with you ? Is that how your parents brought you up?" He scolded me, "What? I'm in love ... what can I do?" I blew on my nails to dry them, "Love is a feeling you can't stop,but KISSING AND HUGGING ARE PHYSICAL ACTIONS, ACTIONS ARE WHAT YOU'RE PUNISHED FOR, NOT FEELINGS" His face became red, "Listen to me, are you trying to convince me that you didn't touch your girlfriend at all? Don't stop me from a thing you've already done, now, I need to finish my nails, and I'm going out, I'm not a kid to be punished" I rolled my eyes, "Oh really? If you're gonna be rude, you're getting a punishment" He was serious, "And ... what are you going to do?" I raised an eyebrow, "You'll see" He slammed the door and locked it, "ARE YOU CRAZY? GET ME OUT OF HERE, THIS IS MY HOUSE" I shouted, "If your father is dead, I'm the one taking care of you from now on".
Screw Karam.
I called Simon, "Hi" He said, "So, where are you?" I asked, "I'm in a hotel", "Okay, I'll sneak out when Karam sleeps, and we'll go to our secret place and stare at each other's eyes all night long", "Uh, Leena, I think we're making some mistakes, aren't you feeling that you're doing something wrong? I mean ... you've always rejected relationships and physical contacts" I felt worry in his tone, "Maybe ... Are you trying to get rid of me in a gentle way? After all what you've done to win me ? At last I fell for you and now you don't want me huh?", "No, No, No ! That's not what I meant ! But, it just doesn't feel right ..." Simon sighed, "Okay, Okay, I get it, bye. Don't call back" I shut my phone down and felt anger run through my veins.
I looked through my window, I saw Karam planting cameras in the garden and under my window, then a van came and 5 dogs came out of it, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING" I shouted, "WE'LL SEE HOW YOU'LL SNEAK OUT", "And how long is this punishment?" I sighed, "Until you realize your mistake, you got a bathroom and a mini fridge, you don't need to get out your room", "Karam? Are you serious?", "Am I smiling or laughing? Then NO" He said as he put the 5th camera on a tree.
I heard a conversation running downstairs, I put my ear on the door and it was Zainab and Karam arguing, she wanted to see me but he told her I'm getting a punishment...
"Open the door" I heard Zainab, "Karam locked it" I said then I heard Karam say "Move" Then he put the key in the door and opened it, I saw a look of anger of his face, "What's wrong?" Zainab asked him, "Let her tell you" He said angrily then left, "So, what's going on?" Zainab asked, "Well ... He just figured about Simon" I chuckled, "WHAT?" Her eyes widened, "And ... he figured out our new relationship" I giggled, "WHAT ! YOU SAID YOU WERE JUST FRIEND?" Her mouth shaped an O, "Shh ! We were ! But, things changed and ..." I sighed, "And WHAT?" She said in excitement, "He saw us kissing under the tree" I said quickly and covered my face, "WHAT ! YOU have got to be kidding me" A smile was drawn on her face, "I shook my head as a No, "OMG, No !" Zainab exploaded in laughter, I blushed, "I can't believe it ! LEENA !LEENA kissed a guy ! Leena who was always arguing me for having a love life !" She kept laughing. Me and Zainab, we were more like sisters, but her attitude was the thing I used to hate the most, She didn't wear hijab, neither proper clothes that actually cover the body, she was always the one with a boyfriend, and I was always the one that used to scold her about it because it was totally wrong.
"How was it? What did you feel? What exactly happened?", "I prefer keeping the details for myself" I laughed out loud while she was begging me to speak, "I knew it ! You can't be just friends with that handsome piece of meat" She said, "Piece of meat? How lower can you get ?" I raised an eyebrow and she slapped me playfully.
