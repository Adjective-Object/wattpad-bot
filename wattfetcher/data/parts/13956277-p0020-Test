"See you tomorrow Tom" Damon turned the car on
"WAIT" I shouted... I wasn't supposed be that loud.
Damon hit the breaks and was about to bump into the glass
"WHAT" Damon screamed
I got down and ran towards Tom
"Wait Wait"
"Oh hey"
"I think that your house is where we met, which is 2 hours away, and you can't go there barefoot, So thank you, here are your shoese" I took them off and went back to the car while Elina and Damon were staring at me.
The drive passed slowly .
When we arrived, I climbed to my room.
"Leena"
"Yes Mrs.Carter"
"Im sorry for what happened"
"It's Okay, I just need to take a rest"
I lied on my large bed and escaped to the world of dreams.
*Next day*
"COME ON WE'RE GONNA BE LATE" I almost crashed Elina's door, she came out in her messy pajama and hair with sleepy eyes
"Whaaaaaaat" She groaned
"Yalla (come on) we're late already yalla get dressed" I pushed her into the closet
"It's saturday, No school" She went to the bathroom
"Are you telling me that I woke up at 5 Am to take a shower and got ready at Time .... FOR NOTHING" I screamed
"Kinda" she chuckled
"UGGHHH" I groaned loudly
"But since you got ready in time for the first time ... I'll take you to the mall as a reward" She smiled widely
"Ok, but WITHOUT your stupid brother" I whined
"I Heard you" Damon popped his head in through the door frame
"yeah whatever" I walked out
"Tom is not always a gentleman" Damon followed me
"Annnnnd why should I care?" I rolled my eyes
"Uhh, I just wanted to tell you"
"Aha ??? so"
"I'll take you and my sister to the mall"
"Nah I don't need someone to keep staring at me and checking me out, Im fine" I gave him the fakest smile I could ever give
mind: You knocked him down GURL
me: Awhh <3 thanks to you mindyyy
mind: oh staahhhppp I'm blushing
"You're beautiful! what can I do about it" He put his hand on his heart, acting like I've hurt him
"If I wasn't a good person, I would've went to marline earlier and told her about what you keep doing to me" I said in almost a threatening tone
"Uh marline ? who's marline?"
"your precious blonde girlfriend" I took a bite from an apple
"You win, bye" Damon backed off
I chuckled, such a rude guy ! cheating on his girlfriend, I know it's already Haram (Having a girlfriend, holding hands and kissing etc .... you know what I mean) , but he's also cheating and hurting her behind her back ... poor girl.
