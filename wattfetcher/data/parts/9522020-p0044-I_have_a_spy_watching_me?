"Get in." She said.
"Are you crazy? I don't even know you." I said sliding over her hood and I landed on my butt on the other side to duck when I saw a gun be pulled out.
They missed. I sighed, but I knew what my chances were and I couldn't just disappear as humans are watching so I climbed in and duck in the seat to not get shot.
She sped forward and after ten minutes she lost them.
"They're gone you can put your head up." She said.
I slowly looked up just in case they were just somewhere where she couldn't see them, but when I looked no one was there. I sighed a relieved sigh. Then I noticed where we really were. I laid back in my seat and shut my eyes with a sigh.
"What are we doing here?"
"We are here so that I can ask you why those people were after you and so that I can know why you've been kidnapped." She said
I sighed knowing I owe her for saving my life. I had to think though. I don't want to talk there and my parents don't like it when I don't tell them anything when it comes to cops. I told her to start driving to my house and she nodded and she said she didn't need directions because someone sent her my address. Creepy people. I got my cell out and started to dial my moms number.
"What are you doing?" She asked.
"You could always just listen to who I am calling. Also you brought yourself into this. Don't be surprised when you feel like your being watched because you most likely are being watched." I told her.
"Talon! Oh thank goodness! Where are you? Are you alright?"
"I'm fine, Mom. I just had a run in with them, but someone got me out of the situation. Now they want to ask me questions. I'm answering them at home." I said.
"Who is it? Why are you going to answer their questions and why did you call me? You could-." I cut her off.
"Mom, it's a detective." I answered.
"What? Who?"
"Detective Beckett and I'm almost home." I told her.
