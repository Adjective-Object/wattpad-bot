"Ohhhhh dont worry you look cute"
I blushed at that then another click sounded oh come on seriously
"Seriously!!" I complained
"What I used my phone this time" he showed me his phone again and i saw myself my cheeks turning pink so i bowed my head blushing again then click oh gosh i covered my face then click as he chuckles.
"Ohhh come on let me see you face " he said mid laughing
"No" i mumbled
"I have chocolate"
I put my hand down as i see his goofy face with chocolate in his nose I laughed hard as I here alot of clicks from his phone camera.
"Stop-please-just-stop" i said mid laugh covering his camera he chuckle and gave me my chocolate latte
"You have got to stop taking pictures of me"
