Hi my name is Jenna. This is the story of my Pokemon Journey...
One day, I woke up to my loud alarm. I jolted up, today was the first day of my journey as a Pokemon Trainer. I was so happy, I had trouble sleeping the night before because of it. Professor Sycamore had chosen a bunch of kids to give their starter pokemon to.
I ate breakfast and said goodby to my mother. I was so excited. I saw a boy sitting at a table outside.
"Hi, You must be Jenna!", the boy said. he was holding a box with three Pokeballs in it.
"The professor told me to give these to you, my name is Calem", he said. I smiled and looked at him.
"My name is Jenna, ai think I'll go with Chespin!"
"Nice choice", he handed me the poleball. He waved goodbye as he left. I was so happy, I had gotten my first pokemon.
"Off to catch more! I'll be a pokemon master", I said.
