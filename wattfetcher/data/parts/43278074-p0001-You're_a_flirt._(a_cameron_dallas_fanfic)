Sammy's P.O.V.
"God. Damn." Alicia said dropping her jaw.
"What?" I said looking around.
"that Jawline tho " Alicia said dumbfounded.
"shittttt babbyyyy" I said putting down my pizza and staring at Cameron Dallas.
" Thats daddy material" Alicia said.
" Preach it sista" I said.
3rd bell rang and it was my only class with Cameron so I rushed in.
Cameron was the hottest. Of course his jaw line was on point as always.
Camerons P.O.V.
"Aye those girls are staring." Nash said.
" So?" I said to him.
"its Sammy Alegria stupid." Nash said making me nervous.
"Dont tell me you HAVEN'T hit that yet!!" Jack G said grabbing my shoulder.
" I've been busy OK?" I said.
"yeah. busy jacking off to her yearbook pic" jack j said and all of them burst into laughter.
"shut up." I said
"I'll make you a deal Cammy boy." Nash said.
"what" I said.
"if by next month you have hit that more than once, i'll give you $50" Nash said.
"hmmmm... deal" I said and walked to 3rd period.
I've had a big crush on Sammy since like 2nd grade. I guess it was about time to get with it. I was hyped as hell to walk into Mrs. Grukens class when I saw Markie the school jock talking to her.
"shit." I said loudier than I thought.
"Cameron Dallas?!" Mrs. Gruken yelled.
"sorry." I said walking to the back desk.
" get with it Cam!" Jack G  said slapping my back.
" I will I will. give me a sec." I said.
