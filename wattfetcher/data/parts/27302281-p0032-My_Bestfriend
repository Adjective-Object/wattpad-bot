Then I threw my phone and  cursed him under my breath   cause I wouldnt wake my mom
Then I heard pebbles being thrown at my window and decided to ignore it I already who was it was... Justin
I just continued to ignore it  then it finally stopped  so I guessing  he gave up  and went home so I cried silently to my self till I fell asleep
(In the morning)
I rolled out of bed and looked in the mirror and frowned thinking of the events of last night and tears rolled down my cheek and I wiped them away   and stripped out of my bed clothes and hopped in the shower
Justin POV
I screwed up
You bet you did I tried to tell you
Oh my god I can't believe I cheated on kylie
Wait till she finds out
I'm gonna go tell  her now
Then I jumped out of bed threw on some  clothes and  ran out to my car  and started it  then drove off
What do you plan on doing
I'm gonna tell her I cheated
I told you that you cared about her
Yeah I'm in love with her
Kylie POV
I stepped out the shower dried off and got dresses and laid on my bed then I heard  pebbles hit my window again
Ingore him maybe he will go away
" kylie " he yelled outside my window
Keep ignoring him
" kylie " he yelled again
" what justin" I yelled  looking out the window to see justin standing there
" I'm coming up " he said
"  no  someone texted me  By the name of s "I said
"  so how was the meeting justin " I hissed from the window
Then he started climbing up and I let him in so I wouldn't draw anymore attention from the streets
"  now you have ten minutes " I said
" ok ask away " he said
" who is s " I asked
" selena "   he answered
" I thought she was your ex why would she tell me about your cheating incident"  I growled
"  I'm sorry baby"  justin said   as tears formed in his eyes
" where did you really go last night "  I asked scared of the answer to this question
