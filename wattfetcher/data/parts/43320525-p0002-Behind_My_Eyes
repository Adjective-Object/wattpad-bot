We left to go to the mall as I said to buy make up. I got creams, powder which I think is called blush... I'm not so sure and lots more make up that resembled my bronzed skin that would be substantial enough to cover my wounds. Mom wouldn't notice. The lady behind the cash register looked pretty confused when she saw the make up but then one look at my face and she said "Oh. Now I get it." I made a face that said yeah, don't judge me biddy... Keith just stood in the background snickering.
"That was one of the most embarrassing things I've ever done!" He complained. "How do you think I feel? I had to actually collect it, bring it up to the counter, buy it and now I must put it on." I sassed. "Yeah. Sorry dude. Your life is like fifty times worse than mine." He messed. "Wow." I blurted. "Could you be any more asinine?"
