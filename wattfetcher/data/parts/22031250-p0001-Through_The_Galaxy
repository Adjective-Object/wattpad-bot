So hi, you know who I am. I hope. Well I had this great idea to write Through The Galaxy. Cool right? Right. Well, you should read the words that aren't this authors note.
Xxx
Lots of love,

I flopped backwards onto my bed, next to my BFF Lily. "So you remember at lunch, when Jasper came and sat next to me?" Lily asked. I turned my head sideways to look at her, confusion written across my face.
Lily giggled. "What? I wasn't paying attention to who sat by you at lunch today." I muttered. Lily giggled again, "You were staring at Jared." She laughed. I just simply shrugged.
I've had a crush on Jared Black for I don't even know how long. He's just so... so perfect! With his side swept black hair, vibrant blue eyes that seemed to dance with blue fire, deep dimples, and beautiful smile.
Jasper is Lily's all time biggest crush. He has platinum blonde wavy hair, deep green eyes, kind smile. As Lily would say "the works". I used to be close with both of them, before Lily and I became friends. I knew just about everything about them. But then they made other guy friends and joined football.
"Lacey? Lacey?" Lily was asking. "Hmm? What? Sorry, I was explaining things in my head as if my entire life was a story." I said sarcastically. She nodded slowly, then continued to blab on and on about Jasper.
