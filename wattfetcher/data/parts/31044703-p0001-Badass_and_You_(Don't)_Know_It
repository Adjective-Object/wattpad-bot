Whaddup Wattpad!
This is the 2nd of three stories I used to write but was deleted and is now brought back to life. The previous title was The Undercover Gang Princess, which I obviously changed to Badass and You (Don't) Know It.
I don't feel like repeating what I already typed in the intro of my other story, so if you wanna know more about me, then either read the other story's intro or my profile.
Though there's a couple things that I don't mind repeating . . .
1) COPY ANY PART OF THIS STORY AND I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND BEAT YOU WITH A SPOON UNTIL YOU DIE. THAT'S RIGHT, A SPOON. READ IT AND FEAR IT.
2) I am very fluent in swearing.
3) I only write on Wattpad with one account, which is this one.
4) Don't tell me what to put in my stories. Please.
5) Don't advertise your story on any of my works. Please, I find it rude and disrespectful. There are other places where you can talk about your works, but mine aren't part of them.
kay byeeeee,
