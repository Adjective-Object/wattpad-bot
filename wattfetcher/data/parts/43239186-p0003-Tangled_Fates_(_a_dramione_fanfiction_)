" Weasley would never fight with her ? It seems he proved you wrong , beaver " he laughed " I don't care about pansy , so don't bother " , as if I'll believe that !
" First , Mr. Malfoy , I thought you would be worried about her . Second , I meant that Ron would treat her better than how you treat me . "
" Well , he certainly didn't show that " , he snorted .
" And third , you asked me what's wrong with her ! Do you want another reason ? "
" No , your voice annoys me , and there is nothing going on with pansy and I "
" Yeah sure , you're right "
" I'm always right " , he replied cockily .
" Okay , let's go to your dorms you lot are giving me a headache " , nearly headless nick said .
And with that we headed to our dorms .
