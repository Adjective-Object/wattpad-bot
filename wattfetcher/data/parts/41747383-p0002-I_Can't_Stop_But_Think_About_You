We decided to go to the club when we got in me and Mitch decided to go to the bar . The bar tender was checking me and out ask so what can I get for this sexy lady right here. I reply saying "give me two shoots ".he gives me the shoots and I give on to Mitch the bar tender tells me the price. I look in my purse and say ah babe git any money .The bar tender say no you have to pay for your own drink .
I could tell Mitch got mad "I have a boyfriend you know " I say the bar tender looks at me "WHO" he says . he's right hear I look over to Mitch and kiss him. The bar tender looks at us and says "Its not real" Mitch gets up and punches him right in the nose. He starts carrying me bridal style and gets in his car and drives off
