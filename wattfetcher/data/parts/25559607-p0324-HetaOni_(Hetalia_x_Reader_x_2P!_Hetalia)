Then I suddenly remembered that I was just wearing a towel. Feeling my face heat up and facepalming at the same time, I spoke, "O-Oops! S-Sorry! It slipped my mind that I was, er, uhm, yeah. This."



"N-No, it's f-fine...It was my fault for disturbing you, eh." Canada told me.



I shook my head. "You weren't disturbing, honest. It was actually thoughtful of you...two to inform me about my phone. Thanks again!"



"R-Right, uhm, you're welcome. Well, we'll leave you be now." Canada said as he started walking away to exit the bathroom.

"Eh?! Join her?" I creased my forehead.

"K-Kumajiki! It-It doesn't work like that!" I said, reddening at the thought.



Suddenly the polar bear just stared at me in silence for a moment.
