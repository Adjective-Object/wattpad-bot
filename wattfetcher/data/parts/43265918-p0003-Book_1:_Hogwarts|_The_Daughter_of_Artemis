"Do you always have to say full names?" Demeter asked.
Ignoring the goddess of agriculture, he continued. "We will send Fawn Bluebell Merle to Hogwarts, but on one note."
"And what would that be?" demanded Artemis.
"The girl will be tested with abilities and gifts the gods themselves wouldn't ever dare give to a demigod. One blessing only, and she is to use it for good or for evil in the upcoming future. And if she survives and helps the wizards defeat the Death Eaters, then fine. She's off the hook. But she'll have to survive and maintain the power. Best not be burned to ashes 'cause of us."
"So she's like a guinea pig." Hecate didn't make it a question. "To be given extreme blessings to see if a human body can withstand."
"Glad someone's on the right track!" exclaimed Zeus.
"But how will Fawn know she's a demigod? That monsters are after her?" asked Hera.
"I got this!" Hermes said and he snapped his fingers--a second later a long slip of parchment filled top to bottom with explanations appeared in his hand and he folded it neatly.
Artemis breathed a sigh or relief. She very well knew her godly blood was very special and unique, mainly because she was of the forst to make such a pact that has been broken. She knew it'd help Fawn. So she smiled gravely and flew down to an orphanage called Wool's and layed Fawn on the doorstep like in those cheesy movies. She rang the doorbell and was gone in a swirl of maple leaves.
Footsteps thumping on the ground were heard inside the orphanage and a middle aged brown-haired lady with brown eyes opened the door to see Fawn, who yawned softly and rolled in her blankets uncomfortably.
That woman was a Muggle-born witch that once attended Hogwarts by the name of Emily Fraz. She read the note, smiled, took the baby in her arms, muttering, "The daughter of Artemis, huh? You have a good future ahead of you, best not waste it, right?"
Chuckling, she walked back inside the orphanage, where Fawn Bluebell Merle would live for many years.
