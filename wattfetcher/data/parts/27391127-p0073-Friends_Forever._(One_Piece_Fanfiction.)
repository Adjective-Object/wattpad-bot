Kidd, for the fun of it wanted to humiliate Sakura and make her serve him, (which was her job anyway) in front of the entire café.
Hence, when Kidd walked in the café, he sat on Table 15. Sakura who had noticed from the time he walked in, felt uneasy.
"Aya, you do this one." Sakura said, noticing his presence.
"I can't. He's on Table 15." Aya noted pointing. Sakura saw Kidd taking his place at the said table and smirking at her.
"Life hates me." Sakura sighed before walking over to him. "Good Afternoon, Master~"
"He. I would like sake and make it cold." Kidd answered rudely.
"Hai!"Sakura answered sweetly.  In her mind, 'That bastard. He's messing with me."


A while later, Sakura brought back a bottle of sake along with a small bowl of ice cubes. Kidd accepted this before pointing to the mess of metal on the ground.
"Master~ It's not good to make messes like that." Sakura pouted, bending to pick up the scraps. That's when Kid smashed the bottle onto Sakura's hair and one could see the sake dripping off her strawberry blonde hair.
(N.B- Yes, I know it was platinum blonde before its strawberry blonde now (for those who are a bit confused, the colour of Portgas D.Rogue's hair) for purposes to be revealed later in the story.)
Aya was shocked and held her hand to her mouth. Ace and Sanji were being held back by Robin and Nami respectively and Haruka looked indifferent. Kidd smirked, his objective was accomplished and he expected Sakura to cry about now. But he was proved wrong when Sakura stood up, flipped the wet hair out of her face and smiled saying, "Master~ You can't do things like that. I haven't done anything to need punishment."
With that, she picked up the sake, broken glass and metal scraps with a Sky Ball and disappeared to the backroom. As soon as that happened, Sanji and Ace pounced on Kidd. The guy barely escaped.
"Sakura, are you okay?" Aya asked, seeing her in a towel with a towel drying her hair.
"Fine. I should probably take a shower before I get drunk from the smell of my own hair."
"No, you aren't hurt anywhere? That bottle smashed on your head you know."
"Its okay." Sakura smiled, " I'm used to this kind of treatment."
Aya smiled before the two were interrupted by the mumblings of Nami.
"Sakura, you okay?" Nami and Vivi asked bombarding the poor girl.
"Guys, I'm fine honestly." Sakura reassured them.
At that moment, Sanji burst in cursing profantities then "Sakura-chwan! Are you o---". Sanji stopped haflway when he realized that Sakura was in a towel and her wet hair draped down her shoulders and a strand led into her breasts. Sanji suffered a nosebleed and lay there fainted on the ground.
"I expected that." Nami stated pathetically looking at Sanji's state. Not too long after that, Ace came but as soon as he saw, he walked back out. "If you intend on staying like that, at least tell me."
Everyone chuckled and stated together, "What a gentleman."
A little while later....
"Are you sure you're okay, Sakura?"
Ace asked, sitting on a bench as the former took a shower.
"I used to that." Sakura answered.
