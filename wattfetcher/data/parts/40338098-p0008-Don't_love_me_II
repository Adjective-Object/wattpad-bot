Of course I had to sit next to Ashton at the dinner. It was no empty spares with the others so I had to sit here. I could feel his eyes on me and it was so creepy that you can't even imagine it.. Harry and Niall was gone to order and I was left here with the others. What should I do? I won't talk to him and this is just awkward. "So what have you done lately?" Luke asked me after a long silence. "Uhm, just been with the boys.. You?" I asked and looked at him. He smiled and I smiled back. "Just practiced and been bored" he said and looked at Ashton who stared over at Harry who was coming back. Liam looked at me with a are-you-okay look. I just nodded and smiled. This was so awkward at the moment and I just want to stand up and leave, but that would be rude.. "I ordered a tacosalad for you" Harry said. He knows that I love it. "Thanks!" I said and smiled. I could feel Ashton look at me all the time. I don't feel comfortable at all! "Uhm, Liam.. Can we talk?" I said and stood up. He walked out with me and looked really worried. "I can't be here with Ash.. He stares at me and I'm don't comfortable when he does it" I said and looked down on the ground. He dragged me into a hug and said "it will be okay.. Just one dinner and then we're done.." I smiled and walked in again. He said that we could switch spots. So I could sit with Luke and Harry instead. "Something wrong?" Harry whispered to me. "I'll tell you later" I said and ate my salad.. This would be a loooong night
