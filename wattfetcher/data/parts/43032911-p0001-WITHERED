This story shouldn't have ended like this. I use to be the good girl who use to get straight A's and was hardly acknowledged by my peers, how could one night of wanting to have meaningless sex ,to break my virginity had turned my life into a fucking nightmare. Why had I chosen Nate to be the one to take my virginity? It was probably because he was more experienced and he promised not to hurt me but he did! I told him "NO!" But he carried on! This story shouldn't have ended like this. I honestly never planned on hurting anyone. I wanted them to feel all the pain and suffering they caused me, I wanted them to remember they drove me to this. They abused me, mentally, verbally and even physically. I just wanted it to end.
I'm sorry.
