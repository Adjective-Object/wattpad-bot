Percy smiled
"Nice to meet you," he said holding out his hand for me to shake. I gladly took it and put all my strength into it, but he didn't been flinch.
"I really would like to stay and talk but we have somewhere to go," Percy said politely, sneaking a glance at Annabeth who nodded at him. "But tell you what, tomorrow, if you don't have plans, how about we meet at StarBucks and we can talk a little bit more,"
Emily stepped forward, "Of course, we would love that," she said, elbowing me in my side
"Ya, sure," I murmured
"Cool, see you there," he said
They both waved their goodbye's and raced towards the car, hand in hand.  watched as he opened the door for her and bowed down. Annabeth rolled her eyes as she stepped in, but I could tell she was hiding a smile.
I took Emily's hand in mine as led her towards my car.
Maybe Percy wasn't such a bad guy after all.
