"Okay, fine. But only for a kiss. That's my price."
"Okay, okay, just stop!" Dean leaned down and pressed a kiss to Cas' lips.
"You know, Dean..."
"Yeah, Cas?"
Cas flipped Dean onto his back. "TICKLE-TORTURE WORKS BOTH WAYS!" he shouted.
They tickle-tortured each other until late morning, when they fell back asleep.

Sam had walked in on a lot of things in his day. Nothing particularly bad, concerning Dean and Cas, at least.
At least he hadn't walked in on them having sex. And he was grateful for that.
But this time, the scene he walked in on was actually quite cute.
Dean and Cas had fallen asleep on the floor. They were snuggling. Sam never thought he would ever see his brother snuggling anyone. Then again, he never thought he'd attend his brother's wedding, either, but he did that too.
Cas had popcorn in his hair and all over the floor. Sam had no idea how they'd managed that. The sunlight was streaming into the room, and their wedding rings were glistening in the light.
Finally, Sam spotted his laptop - the screen still up - and wiggles the mousepad to see what they were doing before... whatever happened. Netflix popped up and it was paused on The Little Mermaid, at Ursula and Eric's wedding.
Sam grabbed his laptop and walked out, rolling his eyes at the cheesy rom-com he'd become a side character in.
He tried so hard to ignore the conversation he heard as he walked out.
"Mmm... Cas, you awake?"
"No, you fucking adorable idiot. Go back to sleep."
He busted out laughing and thought, hey, maybe this is a good rom-com.
