"So you wanna hang out with me Mr.Player ha?" I raised an eyebrow.
He remained silent.
"Elina and Lewis, You can leave now" I smirked at them, They looked surprised but eventually they walked out.
"I can use some help" I gave him an evil smirk.
me: he doesn't know what he's gonna go through
mind: you evil pumpkin, I like whatCha think'n of.
"follow me" I commanded and he did.
"Are you upset or angry" He asked
"Naah!!! why will I be?" I gave him a fake smile
"Ok, So how are you today" He walked beside me
"Al hamdu lellah, I'm fine, and I'll be better if you keep a distance between us" I picked a blouse.
"That'll look good on you" He smiled
"That was nice of you, which is totally weird" I smiled then gave it to him
"You are not just gonna stay here talking and walking without helping me" I threw another one at him.
"so that's a punishment?" He raised an eyebrow, Oh these blue eyes he got they're li- NO! WHAT WAS I THINKING
"Heloooooo?" He woke me up from my daydream
"What" I raised my eyebrows.
"What were you thinking"
"I was wondering how many pieces you can hold" I walked to the skirts' section.
"Hey, these are gonna look hot on you" He passed me short shorts.
"I got a better idea, why don't you buy these for you precious hot girlfriend" I stood on my tiptoe to pull some jeans from the high shelf.
I heard a chuckle behind me.
"What" I said with a straight face
"Your shortness is cute" He giggled
"oh really, so you're mocking now ha? " I crossed my arms over my chest.
"Can't hear you from down there, please raise your voice" he bent down
"Well, let me remind you that first of all I'm 163 centimeters which is normal for a girl, and second, that girl you're calling short has knocked you down and almost broke your ribs" I smirked, Damon coughed.
"I think that skirt matches the jacket you picked" He changed the subject and pulled the skirt for me.
"And try this as well, with the black top" He picked a purple skirt.
"Well, let me admire your taste in clothes. I'm surprised" I said
"You'll love my taste in swimming suits way-way-more" He winked at me
"You know, I don't mind punching your pret- I mean pitchy face right here right now"
"My pretty face ha? so you now admit that I'm a good-looking man. At last" He smirked
"Boy, Good looking (boy) if you wanna be specific"
"Do you realize that you're insulting me by telling me I'm not a man" he said angrily
"Well, as I was told, the word MAN describes a male who is not a womanizer, a male that doesn't keep flirting with girls because he doesn't want anyone to flirt with his sister and forces her to cover herself and doesn't let her date, not because he's a control freak, but because he gets jealous on her and doesn't want any guy to hurt her emotionally or physically ... MAN : the male that doesn't let a guy touch his sister and kiss her, doesn't shout at his mother, works to get money without depending on his parents, helps others, doesn't act like a bad-boy to attract girls. The MAN has a word and a decision, cares about his inside way more than his outside look. He's honest, courage not rude, And the most important feature in the MAN in Islam is : being religious and afraid of god more than any other creature in the world. Tell me now, Do you think that you are a REAL MAN ?" I walked to bring a blue hijab that caught my eyes, leaving Damon speechless.
