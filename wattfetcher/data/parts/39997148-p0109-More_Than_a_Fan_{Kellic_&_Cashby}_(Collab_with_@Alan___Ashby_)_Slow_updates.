"I deserved it."
"No you di-"
"Yes I did Kellin."
"No you didn't! It wasn't your fault Alan." I told him, "You didn't mean to drop it. Or what about the time he accused you of cheating on him with me of all people!"
He looked down at his hands and fiddled with his fingers not saying anything.
"Promise me you won't go back to him." I whispered, "Please? I really don't want you getting hurt again."
"I don't know what will happen."
"Promise me."
"I can't."
"Alan you can't go back to him, who knows what he's going to do to you if you get back with him."
He shrugged and got out of the bunk, "We should get going."
"This conversation isn't over Alan Anthony."
"Its over. This whole thing right here never happened." He said grabbing his camera stuff, "Let's just go."
"Nope. It's not, now let's go I have a psycho to deal with." I said and grabbed his arm pulling him out of the bus.
"Can you let me go?" He asked.
"I don't know can you think about the amazing guy who really likes you instead of an abusive asshole?"
"Yes I can." He said sighing, "I'd like to go see him."
"See who? Roy? Or Austin?"
"Austin. I want to see him before he's on stage."
"That depends- what are you going to say to him?"
"Probably apologize for being an ass to him earlier and stuff. What's it to you?"
"Don't worry about it." I told him and let go of him, "Now go- go talk to your sweet boyfriend who has never done anything wrong-" I stopped talking when I saw Marcie laying on the booth. "Go do whatever the fuck you want I have to go." I said and left Alan standing there to commit murder.
"Stop touching things!" I shouted at her, "Get the hell up!"
"Whatever." She muttered, "It's comfortable and there's nothing to do."
"Well you're fucking things up so get up right now!"
"Why should I?"
"Because I fucking told you to!"
She groaned but got up from the table and flipped me off before walking away somewhere.
"I hate her so much." I muttered glaring at her walking away.
"Who doesn't." Jason muttered.
"I don't even know, I think Jaime does too to be honest." I said and started straightening everything out.
"I know, well the doors are opening so here it comes." Jason told me and I nodded.
The doors opened and we were soon swamped with people wanting to buy merch before Pvris went on. I smiled as I helped someone out, I better get my grades up I don't think I could ever leave this tour. I mean not only do I get to be with the best boyfriend ever I also get to do probably the funnest thing ever.
