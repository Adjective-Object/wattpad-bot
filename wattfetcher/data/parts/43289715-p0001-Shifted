Crystal water splashed and danced over rocks in the beautiful river. Even making the ominous bridge that hovered above it look peaceful, tranquil. Like nothing bad could ever happen here. But a terrifying skidding sound pierced the air. In a split second a light blue jeep had collided with the side of the bridge and rocketed down into the river. With a sound of tearing metal the bonnet thudded into the river bed. The peace was gone. My mothers car was now submerged. I could not move but it seemed like the forest surrounding me was groaning and urging me to take a step. To investigate. I backed away, my feet stumbling over broken branches. Suddenly, an invisible force pushed me from behind and I lurched into the cold water next to the wreckage.I woke on the ice cold floor next to my bed in a web of blankets. This was the fifth dream this week.
