It's Saturday. YES!! NO SCHOOL!!!!
I'm sitting on my couch being a lazyass
( You can thank. @Peri72 for the swear )
I text Levi having nothing better to do.
'Hey Levi. Wanna hang out?'
'Sure Brat. Why don't you come over here in about an hour.'
'Kay! I'll be there in an hour!'
I text a bit to excitedly. I'm going to Levi's place. I wonder what it looks like.
~Levi~
What have I done? Why'd I invite him over? It's a compete mess. Ick. I take out my cleaning spray and my cleaning mask and get to work. Scribbling the floor, de-germing the carpets and furniture.
I hear a knock at the door as I'm scrubbing the tile. "Come in!" I call. Eren opens the door. "L-Levi? Are you some sorta clean freak or something?" I roll my eyes. "Ya ya. Keep your mouth shut Brat. Also, don't forget to take off your shoes. I don't want you tracking mud or dirt in here." I tell him as I scrub. He laughs and takes off his shoes without complaining.
I stop cleaning and put my cleaning tools away. I find Even sitting on the couch with bare feet. I sit next to him. His face turns a slight pink. "Your blushing." I say with a laugh as I raffle his hair with my hand. His blush only darkens and I laugh harder. He cover his face trying to make the blush go away.
"So, do you wanna watch a movie?" I ask. He nods his head. I put in the movie 'blended'. I've seen it before but it still makes me laugh.
As we watch the movie I feel a weird urge to sit closer to Eren. So as the movie goes on I gradually move closer to him. Once we're a few centimeters apart I put my arm around him. He starts blushing. "L-Levi? Wh-what are you d-doing?" He asks a bit shocked. "Oh come on Brat. You know you enjoying it." I say as a tease. His blush darkens mad I laugh again as he turns his face away.
I use my arm to pull him closer to me. He's still blushing but I can see a small smile come across his face. A smile comes into my face to. I don't know why but...I'm enjoying this as well...
