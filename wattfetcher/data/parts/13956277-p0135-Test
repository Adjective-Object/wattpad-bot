Miley and Conor where talking, Jake was laughing, I felt my head getting heavy, my headache increased, I slipped but Jake caught me, "Are you alright?", "Yes, yes I am" I said then ran to the bathroom to throw up.

Every time I tried to open the pregnancy conversation with Karam, I couldn't, I couldn't look at him directly in the eye and explain. He was still shocked because of the fact that the love of his life married someone else. He was already depressed enough, I didn't want things to get worse.
Karam controlled all of my father's work, he even made the companies grow bigger, his depression didn't have effect on his work life. He did his best to make my life better, laughing with me while his heart was crying, I could see it from his eyes because we both felt the same. We both lost our hearts.
I got on the scale, I weighed less than I was before getting pregnant, even though I had been eating like crazy. Do emotions really effect us physically that much ?
............
I was pulled to an empty room, "What do you want ?" I fought the need to hide my face in his neck and cry, "We need to talk" Simon said while tying his shoelace, "You need to look at me then, I have had enough of your insults" I caught the hem of his shirt.
Simon looked directly into my eyes, he looked tired too, "What are you going to do about it?" He pointed at my tummy, "It's not (It), it's a SHE or a HE" I felt insulted by his word, "Whatever, what are you going to do ?" He said in boredom, "And why do you care? You didn't want anything to do with the baby from the first place. You didn't care" I said aggressively, "You are right, I didn't care, and I still don't" He said as he opened the door, "But I wish you know how much it hurts" He whispered to himself as he was walking away, he didn't want me to hear it, if he did, he would've said it in my face.
That's how stabbing knifes right in your heart feels, doesn't it?
I took a deep breath and continued my day normally, if throwing up every hour is counted normal...
