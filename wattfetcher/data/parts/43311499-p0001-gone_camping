Its was Wednesday, July, 4. It was starting to become dark and we had just arrived to our favorite camping spot that we go to every Fourth of July. My friends and I are camping at Lake Forest national park for a week. Until we hear a low growl and a lot of rustling in the bushes next to our rv I called for my friend john,"Hey, John come check this out please ", I waited for a moment for himr to reply but I got no answer, so I decided to go check it out myself. What I saw, will scar me forever.
