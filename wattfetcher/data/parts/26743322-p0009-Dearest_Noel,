dearest noel,
i can't do this anymore noel.
it's so much. so so much. that night. i can't forget that night noel.
i remember how his fingers grazed my skin.
i remember the rough, tearstained and bloody sheets that rubbed against my body.
i remember his defeaning laughter.
i remember how he left my body covered in blue bruises and scratches.
and i remember his words, 'i won't be gone for too long my love'
and i remember you.
you walked in and you saved me.
you saved me noel. you beat him up. you gave him what he deserved and now i know he can't hurt me. but i'm scared noel, very very scared.
because you were my security. when i was with you i felt safe. i felt like i could spread my wings and fly. i felt alive. you consumed me with a burning, fiery passion. you ingnited passion through my soul. you brought adventure into my life.
every single moment with you is hidden so safely deep inside my heart. i can never forget you.
i refuse to forget you.
i will not forget you noel.
but i am so so scared noel.
you are my superman.
and now you're gone.
who's going to protect me now?
