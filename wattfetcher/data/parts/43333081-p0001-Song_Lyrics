I found myself dreaming silver and goldI can see from a movie that every broken heart knowsYou walk in that moon lightAnd you help me closeIt's been a second that you disappearAnd then I was all aloneI woke up in tears with you by my sideBreath of relief when I realizeOh and I promess tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose youI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbyeWherever we standing I won't take you for granted'cause we'll never know when we'll run out of timeSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
The blank of the night just a whispered smokeYou could lose everything the truth is you'll never knownSo I'll kiss you long baby any chance that I getAnd I'll make the most of the minutes in love with no regretsSo let's take the time to say what we won'tUse what we got before we're so goneOh and I promessa tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose youI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbyeWherever we standing I won't take you for granted'cause well never know when we'll run out of timeSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
