"Is she alright? What happened? Did they tell you anything?" Her mom asked.
"They told me to leave the room." I said. I sobbed and her mom hugged me.
"Did they say anything?" Her dad asked.
"Nothing, they just told me to leave the room and the took a bunch of wires and connected them to her and stuff." I said as I wiped a tear from my face.
"Erin?" They both kept saying. I leaned on the wall and put my face in my hand as tears escaped my eyes without me doing anything.
Erin's POV
I'm in a hospital bed? The last thing I remember was I fell backwards and Jordan caught me. Then now I'm here.
"Jordan?" I attempted to scream.
"Yes, I'm right here. Erin, talk to me." Jordan said before he was ordered to leave the room.
"Jordan?" I said slightly less weak then last time.
"Erin? Jordan!?" I heard my mom and dad screaming.
