Awww homework...
I remember when I did it...
*sighs*
I called my teacher the b word
I'm not a good role model but she was annoying she's all like
"Good morning class."
Us:......
"GOOD MORNING CLASS"
Me: good morning *mutters* b*
Yeah it was louder than I wanted it to be
But she didn't hear
I think O.o
Today was open house and she said I paid attention and was a good student
I almost laughed out loud at that moment
All I do is try not to fall asleep and curse
Ugh I do not like science
Or school
My history teacher rocks though!!
She's ADHD and hilarious
"THE DAY I FIRST MET YOUUUU YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULF NEVER FALL IN LOVEEEEE!"
I'm such a lovatic....
Guys I found my definition
in the dictionary!!!
"Nerd: weird, socially awkward, and/or ugly."
That's literally what it said.
They have been stalking me
Nico: you are socially awkward and weird and-
Beautiful? I know.
Nico: that's not what-
Shhhh don't speak...
