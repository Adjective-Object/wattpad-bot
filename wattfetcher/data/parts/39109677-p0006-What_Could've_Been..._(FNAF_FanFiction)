The twins stared at me silently, and then Goldie burst out laughing, while I turned back to the page of my notebook I'd been working on. Freddy remained silent.
"Sooo..." Freddy began, "Why don't you talk if you can?" Great, he goes strait for the question that people leave alone...

My mom died awhile ago...she was the town freak, without her to protect me, I became the town freak, everyone here hates me...If I talked it wouldn't matter, my words would be forgotten and disregarded...I'm not even sure I know how to anymore. It's been a use it or lose it situation, I haven't tried to talk in almost two years. I'm sure I've lost it by now.

I looked up at the brothers as I finished writing, they quickly scanned the paper, and a sad look came across their faces.
I gasped as I was enveloped in a two-way hug, both tight, both warm and comforting.
"Hey, people!" Goldie called out, still hugging me. "Proxis is our friend now, and we don't care if you people shun her!"
"That's right!" the other twin picked up, sounding just as enraged, "She's not a freak, and we like her! You people are jerks because you're judging people by the way they look, not who they are!"
"And-"
"We-"
"Won't-"
"Stand-"
"For-"
"It!"
The twins finished the sentence together, and I couldn't help but squirm as they hugged me. Their hug was forcing me to face the class, who all happened to be staring at me. The girls had hate and jealousy in their eyes, they'd probably fell in love with the twins as soon as they had seen them. The boys stared at me with the same rage, their girlfriends were mad at me so they were too.
Great... The bell rung, and the boys finally released me. They gathered their stuff, and I, mine.
The twins looked at me as we left, giving me a smile and a thumbs up.
Do I have...FRIENDS?!
