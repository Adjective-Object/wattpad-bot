Kylie POV
I woke up in Justin's bed with no justin so frowned to myself and  walked downstairs   and saw still no justin so I walked back upstairs and texted justin
To sexiest man alive

From the sexiest man alive

To sexiest man alive

From sexiest man alive

That made me grin like an idiot I love this boy so much
To sexiest man alive

Then I put my phone away and hopped in the shower and  washed  my  hair and everything else then hopped out and wrapped a towel around me  and walked out into Justin's room and dug into his drawer for an outfit  and  slid  it  on  over my undergarments and   laided down in Justin's bed taking in the scent and smiling to my self   I stared  up at the ceiling and smiled I love this shirt I though twirling the ends
". My clothes look good on you " I heard a familiar voice say and I jumped up and leaped  into there arms and he surprising caught me
" justin " I  said   wrapping my arms and legs around him
" hey " he smiled  putting me down then  crashing my lips into mine  and then he pulled away
"   Ok my clothes look extremely sexy on you "he  whispered which sent a shiver down my spine
Then I got an idea  I took his beanie and dashed downstairs and he chased behind me  calling my name and begging for his beanie
" kylie give me back my beanie " he whined
"   when your ready come and get it " I said quoting selena
" don't quote her "  he said sternly
" ok mister bossy pants " I grumbled
Then justin came charging at me and    ran  on the other side of the couch and he chased me around it a few times then he jumped on the couch but I took off upstairs and into his room   and shut the door then hid in his room  he came charging in  looking  around confused at where I had went  I was trying to hold back a giggle but failed but justin came in after me and I ran out of my hiding spot and he pushed me on the bed and climbed on top of me and took his beanie back
" good girl now was that so hard " he teased kissing me
then climbed off of me then kissed me again  and I used it as the time to steal the beanie back  and I  went to run off but justin grabbed me firmly around the waist
