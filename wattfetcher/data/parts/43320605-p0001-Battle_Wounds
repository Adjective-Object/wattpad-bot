Now I am not going to bore you with my sob story, or say how I am going to get better. Because truth is I don't know if I am ever going to get better. My story isn't just where I am a normal person who goes through suffering. I am not normal and I'm different. My name is Natalia Marie Costa and I'm 13 years old and this is my story. You see I'm the youngest of 2 and i have one older brother and his name is Anthony Vincent Costa he is 15. We were very close until our parents divorced. My mom is a lawyer and my dad is a lawyer their just better as friends, or at least what they say. My Dad's name is Alexander Van Costa and my Mom's name is Kassandra Ann Costa, she kept her married name after the divorce. Her madien name was Bellini. I have anixety, depression and dyslexia. My parents never told anyone about my "disorders". Their ashamed of having a daughter who's different, so I don't take medication but instead go to therapy. Its supposed to help me but it doesn't. My parents enrolled me in dance at Seattle Dance Excellence at age 2 and I'm on their competition team. My parents never come to any of my competitions, recitals, performances or showcases. I got used to it over the years. They claim they don't have time for me, but they make it to everything for my brother. They enrolled me in singing, voice, technique, yoga and gymnastics classes. Lastly they put me in Seattle West Academy, which is aÂ  private school with my brother. They just want a perfect daughter and since they didn't get that with me they ignore me and forget that I exist. Here is my story...
