"Oh that. I kinda wanted to slip that in there but I forgot to. I was too worried about getting all my words out right." He admitted.

"Well so are you. I'm gonna protect you at all costs. I love you so much." Johnny said. I smiled and nodded.

"I know. I love you too." I whispered and laid my head on his chest.
