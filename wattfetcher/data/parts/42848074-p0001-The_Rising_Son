Hello!

I'm very excited for this story! It's a sequel to my first series, though, so I advise you read those first. The books are,
1. The Flyer and The Healer
2. The Runner and The Fighter
3. The Finder and The Seeker
(The Student is just a spin-off short story.)
You don't have to have read that series to understand this one, but it would make things probably a lot clearer to you. But, whatever you want to do, that's cool.
This story takes place 19-20 years after the end of the third book, just to let you guys know. It will be written in past tense, third person, just to switch things up.
I hope you guys enjoy The Rising Son! Let me know if you're as excited as I am, down in the comments! :D
Thanks so much!!
Vanessa :)
