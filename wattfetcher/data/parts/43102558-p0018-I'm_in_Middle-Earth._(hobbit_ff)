Blake's POV....
We left Michelle behind. It was storming. "This is no thunderstorm. It's a  thunder battle. The legends are true." Balin said. A rock giant came out from the mountain. Kili, Bilbo, Bofur, Haley, and Dori were on one knee while we were on another. The rock giant hit the mountain allowing us to get off. It hit the mountain allowing the rest of the company to join us. I noticed Bilbo hanging off the edge over the mountain. I pulled him up.
"I thought we lost our burglar." Balin sighed.
"He's been lost since he left the shire. Dwalin check the cave and make sure that it is safe to enter." Thorin ordered.
"Clear. It has no tunnels connecting to it." Dwalin said.
We went in and set up our bedrolls. I decided to keep watch with Bofur. Fili missed Michelle. Bilbo go up and started to leave. Bofur stopped him. "Where are you going?" Bofur asked. Bilbo stopped.
"I'm going to back Rivendell." Bilbo answered.
"I understand. You're homesick." Bofur spoke calmly.
"No you don't. You don't have a home. You spent most of your life moving from place to place. I-I'm sorry. It's just that Thorin is right about me. I don't belong."
"It's alright. What's that?" Bofur wondered pointing to Bilbo's glowing sword.
Gandalf said that it would glow blue if orcs or goblins around. I don't sense orcs. It has to be goblins. I thought.
"Goblins!" I spat.
"Everyone up!" Thorin bellowed.
The cave floor fell below us. We slid down a tunnel. We landed in a cage. Goblins tied up up and took us to their king. The goblins searched us. "Question them. Start with the girl." The Goblin King ordered.
"Nooo!" Thorin yelled and walked to the front.
"Well. Well. Well. Look who we have here. Thorin Oakenshield, king under the mountain, but there is no mountain. I know a certain pale orc who wants your head. He just wants the head. Where is your she elf friend? I guess Azog can deal with one of you. Send word to the pale orc that we found his dwarven prize." The goblin king laughed.
"The she elf has a name, and she is with her kin! Why would Azog want her?!" Fili shouted.
"She is not just an ordinary elf. With her ring of power, her powers unlocked. She has the powers of an animal shapeshifter." Goblin King sneered.
"You lie!" Fili shouted again.
"Kill them."
A white light got the goblins away from us. Gandalf came to the rescue. Michelle wasn't with him. Fili seemed disappointed. Gandalf told us to get our weapons. We ran after Gandalf killing any goblin in our way. A bridge broke. Kili grabbed a ladder and led the way. We used the ladder as a bridge. We got on another bridge. Both sides broke. We swung back and forth until all of us were off. We reached a huge bridge. The Goblin King appeared.
"You can't stop me wizard." Goblin King laughed.
Gandalf cut Goblin King's leg, stomach, and throat. "That'll do it." Goblin King said. He collapsed. The bridge broke. The half we were on fell to the ground. Gandalf, Haley, and I escaped.
"Well that wasn't so bad." Bofur chuckled.
