"It the same one each time" i said.But today it fleet different i didn't know why but it did.
I look around to see a big empty wharehouse. Something felt strange i look down and saw a black sword , i lifted it up to see. it had bright golden runs through it was beautiful. I began to look around.
Question: why am i in a wharehouse ?
Answer: i don't know
I look around there was not special about this wharehouse it was completly empty so why am i here with a sword ?
I heared a shuffling sound come form all around the room  and then it change to running.
I wanted to say something but i know it only make it worse, the. I feelt my heart pounding against my rib cage.
I was afraid.
What is out there ?
What does it want ?
Why am i here ?
Then it hit me , my sword bang my thigh.
"Of course"i said.
Someone brought me here to fight with whatever is hiding in the shadows.
But ... Why ?
The running continue.
What is it waiting for ?
why i am here ?
I began to ask  myself questions that didn't have answers .I realize that the running had stop.but why did it collapse? no the body hitting the floor would had made a sound then what happen?A soonas  that thought cross my mind out of the corner of my eyes i saw something move I turn to face it,out of the shadow a dog like creature ten feet tall ,full red ,pale and distorted face.
