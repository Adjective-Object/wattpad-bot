Cops car.
As he took me in I was told that I was charged for illegal fighting. But since I had no parent or legal guardian I wasn't aloud to be bailed out. I was then put into a vacant cell with a bed and open toilet which I think is just gross. They took my bag which had my money and phone.
Since I was fighting late I was brought in last night at 3:00 am. It's now the morning and I'm in a room waiting for a social worker to come and explain my 'situation'. As I was patiently waiting a small curved woman with a black suit and circle rimmed glasses, with her hair pulled back tightly into a secure bun. The lady looked stern and not in the mood for any of my shit.
'Miss Parker I am here to explain your situation and what will happen. I have been informed that you are here because you have been caught illegally fighting.' She stated.
'Yeah well you informed correctly. What of it.' I said.
'Well because your not 18 yet your still technically a minor and with no legal guardian we have selected a nice couple in California for you to live with.
My face must of been really red as the lady looked slightly terrified as if I was about to blow and I was how dare she try and make me move to California. Trying to stay calm I asked her... 'When am I leaving'
'Well we will let you go to your place to pack but you will leave later today.'
I was fuming by now all in one day my life will change what about Carter and James they are my family I will miss them phone calls, texting, and video chats are all I will have. I jumped to my feet and flipped over my chair with so much force it hit the back wall. The lady jumped to her feet and ran out of the room. Within a minute two guards came in to take me to my apartment before I had to leave to California.
