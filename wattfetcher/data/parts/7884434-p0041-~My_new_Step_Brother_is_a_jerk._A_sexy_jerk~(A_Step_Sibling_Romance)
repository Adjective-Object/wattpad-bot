Shea's P.O.V
"God Ashley let her fucking go! You told me you weren't gonna hurt her" i hear Casper yell.
He was fucking in on this?
"Casper fucking relax, shes tied up in the basement. We have it under control, we're not hurting her" She exclaims, as I hear her open up the cellar door. I watch as all their feet start to make their way down the stairs. My eyes fill with tears as I come eye to eye with Casper.
"You asshole!" I yell as I try to get up and beat the shit out of him. Ashley's brother runs up to me and slaps me hard against the face. I can't contain it any longer and I start sobbing, just down right sobbing. I watch Casper's face drop, and turn so very pale, his jawline tensing and becoming more defined as he looks away from me. "This is all your fault you ass! Seth will kill all of you when he finds out what you're doing!"
Ashley laughs and looks me dead in the eyes. A smirk on her lips "Not if we kill him first sweet heart" That was it. Thats all it took for me to brake the rope holding my hands. I got up and darted towards her repeatedly punching her nasty face. She screamed for help, as punch after punch hit her face. Before I knew it I was ripped off of her and held tightly. I knew it was Casper because Ashley's brother had to help her up. "you little bitch!" Ashley yells.
I keep trying to get out of Casper's grip but he's holding me so tight. "Thats what you fucking get! Don't fucking touch him! Or so help me god I will kill my with my bare hands Ashley!" I yell. I watch as the blood runs down her face and I smirk "Looks like I just fucked you up twice! And you're still a lowlife pussy who can't fight! You need other people to do your dirty work. Ugh you're a c*nt" I yell at her. She looks at me puzzled. "Casper fucking let go of me!" I yell again as I kick him hard in the shin. I may be small by god damn I'm strong.
"Tie her back up and make sure you shove something in that tramps mouth so I don't have to listen to her speak. We have a job to do boys." I grunt as they throw me back against the chair. Casper holds me down as Ashley's brother grabs a new rope, he ties my hands and feet this time. He grabs a clothe and ties it around my head so I cant speak, it's taste absolutely disgusting.
"Wy re yhu doin his Casr" I try to speak through the clothe, it coming out in a jumbled mess. He stands in front of me and goes to gently caresses my face, making me wince thinking im about to get hit. He lowers his hand and tries looking in my eyes.
"Because I want you Shea. I want you all to myself. Seth can't always have what he wants" He whispers to me. I cringe and turn my head away from him.
"I cld nevr love somnone lke yhu" I say angrily, tears running down my face. I close my eyes and he turns away from me. He looks so angry as he walks back upstairs, leaving me alone with Ashley's brother.
"I told you Shea, we wouldn't have to do this if you just cooperated" He whispers and looks down shaking his head.
I watch as he walks away from me and goes upstairs. The tear's continuing to fall down my face. The light turns off and I lower my head softly crying to myself. I take a deep breath and slowly fall asleep.
-------------A few hours later-------------
I wake to the sound of rustling and feet. My head slowly rises as the light to the basement turns on. I recognize Ashley's brothers shoes and I watch as he starts coming down. My eyes widen as I look up at him and see he's carrying a person over his shoulder.
The person is limp and has a bag like thing over their face. I watch as he plumps the person on a chair across from me. And ties them up, their body tilting forward like their knocked  unconscious. The person is wearing a pair of guy skinny jeans and a white v-neck. I can tell its a guy because of his build. He's slightly tan and he looks tall.
"Well Shea looks like you have a new friend." Ashley's brother laughs. He pulls off the bag and I look at the persons face. I feel my heart drop and I instantly start crying.
"Seth" I whisper.
