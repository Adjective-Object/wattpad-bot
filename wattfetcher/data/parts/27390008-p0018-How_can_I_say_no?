"I won't leave. Believe me. Cuz I'd be lost without you too." Johnny said. "But if you want to do it, I won't stop you." He picked up the razor and held it out to Samantha. She took it and held it above her wrist. She was shaking. She shook her head. "If it's cuz I'm watching I can look away." Johnny whispered.
"No. I can't do it. You talked me out of it." Samantha said as she gave the blade back to johnny. He gave her a weak smile.
"Then I think we both know what needs to be done with this." He said as he held it out to her once more. She nodded and took the razor. She got up and unlocked the door an  walked outside. She threw the razor into the nearest trash can and went back inside the trailer, locking the door again. Johnny had moved to lay down on the couch. He beckoned Samantha over. When she was in front of him, he pulled her into his lap. She laid down on his chest.
"You know when I was holding that razor, it took everything in me to stop myself from running it across my own wrist and letting you do the same. You aren't alone." Johnny whispered. Samantha looked up at him.
"Really?" She asked. He nodded.
"Take off my bracelets." He said. Samantha did as he said. She got to his leather band and slowly unbuckled it. Once she got it off, she gasped. Scattered across his wrist were scars. She pulled his wrist to her lips and kissed every one like he had done. Then she put the bracelets back on. She looked up at johnny. He had his eyes closed. He couldn't look at the damage he had done to himself. Samantha leaned up and kissed him. She pulled away and watched as he opened his eyes.
"Oh johnny." Samantha said as she wrapped her arms around his neck. Johnny buried his head between her shoulder and neck. The two laid on the couch like that for a while. Then sleep came as a welcome to them after the crash.
