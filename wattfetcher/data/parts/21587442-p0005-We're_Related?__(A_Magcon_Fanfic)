"Hey,"  Matt said.
"Hi, whatcha guys doin?"  I asked them.
"We're looking for a good movie to watch, you know one?"  Aaron asked.
"Dude, we're looking for a good, scary movie, and your asking a girl, not the best choice,"  Nash said.
"Dude, ever thought of The Purge?  Paranormal Activity?  The Chucky Movies?"  I asked them.
"Oh yeaaaaahhhhh,"  They all said.
"Yeaaahhhh,"  I said, and sat down in between Matt and Cam.
The picked the scariest Paranormal Activity there is, I mean, I'm not to scared of it, but it still gets you at times.  About half way through the movie, half the guys and I screamed because it was scary, and I felt Matt put his arms around me, I looked up at him and he was smiling at me.  Then, another scary part comes out of no where, making me put my face on his chest so I don't have to look at the screen.  This went on for the entire movie.  When the movie was over, they let me chose a movie, so I picked The Fault in Our Stars.  We started watching the movie, and about half way through the movie, I started falling asleep.  I hear Matt whisper something to the guys, and I feel him pick me up and carry me somewhere.  I look up at him.
"You don't have to carry me, I can walk,"  I whisper.
"No, it's ok, I don't mind, just go back to sleep."  He whispers to me.
"Ok,"  I whispered, and rested my head on the crook of his neck.
When we get to my bedroom, he sets me down and tucks me in.
"Night,"  He said, he was about to leave, but I grab his hand.
"Will you stay with me?"  I asked, tired.  I could almost see him smiling.
"Sure,"  He whispers.
He takes his shirt of, and by the way, nice abs, and lays next to me.  He wraps his arms around me from behind, and whispers goodnight.  I whisper it back and soon, fall into a dreamless sleep.
