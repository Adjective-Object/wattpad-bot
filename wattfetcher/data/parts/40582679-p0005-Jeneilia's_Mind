I wanted to make a chapter her cause she's been my best friend for 2 years!! She's like my first ever real best friend . Shes amazingly beautiful and crazy and funny. We've had a hole lot of fun together she's my partner in crime. I would kill for her and I'm sure she'd do the same for me. My worstest time ever was when we were upset for months over a dumb thing!. We look back at why we were upset and laugh and that's the good thing about us we laugh out whatever together our teachers can't seperate us as much as they want to because we're always talking and laughing . Once our form teacher moved up the whole class but he left us together!! . Our class hate how we'er always laughing but its just because we have countless inside jokes!!!. I'm really happy for that day when she said I was her bestie I love her so much!!...
