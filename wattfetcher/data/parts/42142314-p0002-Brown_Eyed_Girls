By now, her father comes and holds her tight her, rubbing her back. "You'll be here during holidays. Don't worry 'bout it. We'll be fine. Except your step mom. You know how emotional she gets."
Feeling awkward and out of place, I climb in the truck, slamming the door behind me. It doesn't take long for the two family members to follow suit. Her dad turns towards me, ruffling my hair. "I'll miss you, too, kid."
I almost feel bad. They've been through so much recently, and now Aoi and I are leaving. Her sister lives with her mom, her step sister died of leukemia; her half brother stillborn. We're the only two left. A hand reaches out from the backseat and closes around my arm. "Hey, Piper? You think we'll be okay?"
Her question puzzles me for a second. The way she goes on about this move immediately lead me to think she had no doubts. How could I be so short-sighted? "Honestly, I think we'll be fine. I mean we probably won't be world famous or anything, but with your money and my charm-"
Aoi slaps the side of my head and retreats back to her seat. "Screw you! I thought you were being serious."
I laugh, a little too loudly. Who knows? Maybe we will find a place for ourselves in Seoul. Especially with my good looks and sharp wit. Oh, and Aoi's money.
