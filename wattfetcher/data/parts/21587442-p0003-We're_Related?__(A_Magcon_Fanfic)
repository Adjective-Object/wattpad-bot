"Dude, how is she related to you, she's hot!"  Carter exclaimed.  I blushed a little.
"Thanks,"  I said with a smile.
"Anyways, I'm Shawn,"  Shawn said.
"I know who you guys are,"  I said.
"Cool, so, we gonna go shopping or what?"  Aaron asked.
"Let's go!"  I exclaimed, we yelled by to mom and the others, and piled into a limo.
"Why do you guys have a limo?"  I asked.
"Well, besides a tour bus, this is the only thing that can fit all of us,"  Cameron explained.
Once we got to the mall, I did my magic.  I managed to cover the 3 story mall in about 6 hours, than these guys could in a couple days.  They were extremely tired, so we left and grabbed some taco bell and left for their house.  Apparently Nash and Cam are going to move into the Magcon house in a couple weeks, so then it'll be me, Hayes, Skylynn and mom.
"Hey Ashley, why don't you move in with us?"  Cam asked me.
"Are you sure that your house is big enough?"  I asked them.
"YouTube and Vine paired up, to get us a 20 bedroom, 25 bathroom, and 10 extra room mansion, I think there is plenty of space,"  Matt said.
"Uh, I guess if it's ok with you guys and my mom, sure,"  I said.  The guys all agreed they wanted me to move in with them, "Ok, I'll asked,"  The guys were happy.
We spent some time at the Magcon house, until it was getting pretty late, so they dropped me and Nash off at home.  We stayed up a little more, and I soon decided to go to bed.  I went upstairs to my room, got changed, said good night, and went to bed.  Soon after I laid down, I passed out.
