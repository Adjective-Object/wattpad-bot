Caleb's povNow I know why I didn't received Dauntless as the aptitude test result.They're crazy, running of trains ,shooting guns, fighting.I could never do that everyday,I'm sure.After all this day,definitely I don't want to be on trouble with any dauntless.Amity is not dreamland either,they dont worry that theres a war out there,only peace and happiness.How can a person can live that oblivion to everything,its illogical.There's me again thinking on the logical part of everything,after all I'm still erudite,no one could get rid of that part of me,not even myself. I remember the cold nights in abnegation,when I locked my door and started reading, against the rules. It was my guilty pleasure and still is. I got science,chemistry and history books from the schools library where I did a volunteer, the volunteer was nothing else than an excuse to read without anyone looking me,any one except the librarian.She was a very good with me,considering abnegation and erudite hated eachother,she would never say anything about me reading,and she gave me books eventually.No one really knew this part of me until the choosing ceremony,where I droped my blood in the erudite bowl.I still remember my families faces when I did it.My father was nearly crying,he hated the erudite.My mother was sad but she smiled,probably she only wanted me to be happy.Finally my sister,Beatrice, she was shocked,and I felt that she was angry with my too.I hear the door open,slowly."You're the stiffs brother aren't you?"-said the dauntless that Beatrice shot some hours ago,Peter."If you're referring to Beatrice,yes,I'm her brother""Well,the amity told me that I had to share the room with you"-great,now I'm having this guy watching me sleep,great."How's your shoulder?" I ask."Its great,it doesn't hurt,its not like your sister shot me anyways"-he says sarcastically.I really hate sarcasm,that's why when Beatrice used it back in abnegation I always told her to shut up."Shut up and get on your bed already""Wow,an angry stiff.Who would think about it?""I'm not a stiff""And then why are you dressed as one?""Maybe because its not a good time to be an erudite.""You're sure a strange family,but I have to admit you two have the same temper""And I have to admit that you never shut your mouth""I think we're going to be very good friends""Whatever"
I cannot sleep,my parents are dead,the stupid guy next to me snorts,and I have to say I don't really want to sleep on the middle of a war,when they can attack you in any minute.Its 3 am.I decide to go for a walk to the Amity farms.Theres only silence.It almost like abnegation,almost."Werent you snorting on the room 5 minutes ago?"-I ask when see Peter right beside me."I thought it wouldn't be fun partying inside""God,you're so stupid""You know not everything has to be logical.Right?""Well, it should be""Not everything is as you wish it is. I've learned that on the bad ways""Let me alone,OK? I'll find somewhere else to sleep"With that hes gone.
Peter POVThat guy is cold as ice. I like that. I also like he has his own mind,not like Molly or Drew.Its almost 6,the time when amity wake up,I decide to go with trisfour?,fouris?,Fourtris! That's it!"Hey Tris,I like your hair.To be honest its horrendous, did you meant cut it all short and weird,like that?""Let her alone Peter"-says Four who's wearing a green T-shirt.I'm trying not to laugh on how ridiculous he's right now."Okay,okay.Tobias"-now I know something that hurts him,his weak point.I go away,to do my turn to the farms.I see there Caleb,who sees me in less than a second."Would you please stop following me,I have work to do"-he says pissed as always."Calm down , I only came to work."We both start working,he seems to have struggles,he is weak,but I get it,he came from abnegation and transfered to erudite,he didn't had to do as much handwork as now.
Finally the times over,Caleb went earlier considering he injured his ankle.I go to the showers I'm dirty as hell."Come on,you also follow me to the showers,just no,you're creepy as fuck"-says Caleb."Can you go,please?""OK.ok""Now I get why my sister doesn't like you""Ouch,that hurts"
