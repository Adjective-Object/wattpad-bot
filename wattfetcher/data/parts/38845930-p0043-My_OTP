"Hi." I said.
"Mommy."
"Oh, what's up?" I asked.
We talked the entire day about what we're gonna do when I get out of the hospital and everything.
By the time my ex called me too get Boo back, she was asleep.
"Give her back." He said.
"She's asleep but I'll have Jordan drop her off."
"Bye." He said hanging up before I got the chance to say anything else.
Jordan took her to the car successfully without waking her, and drove her home.
"Hey." Jordan said sounding sad when I answered his phone call.
"What?" I asked.
"I -- I'm not gonna be able to make it back to the hospital tonight." He said.
"Oh no, why not?" I asked.
"My car -- " he said as he cried.
"Jordan?"
"I almost crashed my car because the brakes... my brakes aren't working anymore." He said.
"It's ok y -- you'll get someone to bring you tomorrow, it's already midnight." I said.
"I want to be there the entire time you are."
"Don't be, you have a life to live in these three days I'm here. What's the point of staying with me if you have other things to do?" I asked.
"I don't have anything to do beside record videos, and I can record later." He said.
"You post two or three a day." I said.
"I ca -- your right." He said.
"I have prerecorded videos that I can upload." I said.
"'Scuse me, we want ask a few questions... I can come back later if you need me to." One of the nurses said.
"Stay!" Jordan screamed.
"No, i'm gonna go, I'll talk to you later. I love you... bye." I said.
"Bye, babe. I love you." He said.
I hung up the phone and sat up to talk to the nurse.
"So... what questions?"
"I'm just gonna ask you some basic question about your health and some recent things going on. You want to start?" She asked.
"Sure."
