It was 5:00 pm and Ethan Dolan was coming to pick you up for your first date.  You put on your high wasted shorts with a black crop top, and your vans. You also tied a flannel around your waste. You put on light make up and put your hair in a fish tail braid. All of a sudden you heard a knock on the door. It was Ethan. He said, " Hi Y/N are you ready to go? " You replied, "yes", grabbed your penny board and walked out the door. You skated down to a local pizza shop for some dinner. You felt awkward because you didn't really talk that much. After dinner you skated down the the beach. The sun was just setting. Ethan said, " I had such a great time tonight. "  You replied, " I did too." He leaned in and gave you a big kiss. He said, " I love you so much Y/N. " You said, " I love you too Ethan Grant Dolan, I love you too." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I hoped you liked it I will be writing a lot more! ~ NicoleðŸ’™
