Sakura frowned over this. Who was this Dragon Nicolas Akira was talking about? The guy up at the penthouse? But she didn't dwell about that particular person and what he had to do with Akira. She was more worried about Toby.
"Have you tried the third floor?" she asked as she now shuffled the gown down her person and grabbed for her bra. "He was there the last time he was missing."
"No, I haven't. I'll go and do that now."
"You do that," Sakura said. "I'm on my way."
"Okay, see you soon."
"Bye," Sakura said. She rested the phone in her bag and quickly grabbed her clothing.
She got dressed in a minute flat and then rushed out the dressing room. She came across Haruka and begged an apology. "Toby is missing. I'll come back the moment I found him and is sure that he's okay."
Haruka nodded and ushered her out the door.
