Made... so fanart.... I guess.... Here you go MsMisery, me hop u enjoy u r fanat cause I worke so Hurd on ite. (I really tried my best to make that sentence with the worst spelling and grammar :P) Anyway, the eyes glitched my tablet, making it crash. But it was worth it, I just couldn't do the same for the other eye. Tâ—†T Tried my best on the shading....
Time: Umm... 1 day? I started at like 9:30 at night and didn't finish till 7:40 in the morning. Basically 2 hours.
Program: IbisPaint (I'm freaking loving this app. :P)
Ok, now, here's the(not really a list) of request... (Haven't even started on one T^T)
Potatoquake: Umm, do you still want the wings and is your persons hair in a bun?
Kandy Queen16: You want your profile pic drawen, right!?
Maybe pick one. But let me warn you, if you pick chiba or MC style, there is no guarantee that it will turn out perfect. But I will try...
1) Human Version
2) Chibi
3)Minecraft Style (may suck)
When you sent me your request make sure to be detailed. Someone would give me a request and say draw their profile picture for instance, but I have horrible eyes from staring so close to the screen for 4 hours straight, so I can't see their tiny little picture.
