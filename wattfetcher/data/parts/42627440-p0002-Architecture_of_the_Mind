My hair is long, it is blond
The skin hiding my bones, flesh and self is porcelain
A body of a woman, possesses the mind of man
I am my father's son
Forget your preconceived notions
Stare at ever changing eyes framed by delicate black swords
I can see the lust as your eyes fixate on blood lips Just remember to never forget that,
I am my father's son
Gaze past the conventional, struggle to view what lies beneath
Observe the girl consumed by the love for masculine and feminine
Watch as she reads the comics, the books, the television programs
All meant for boys, little boys meant to be their father's sons
Yet they always seem to ignore the little girls
Who too are father's men, and mother's women
The children who know how to shift into both
All of us, the girls living on the line between both
The shifters, the children lost to identification
All of us together hiding behind the eyes of man or woman
This is our prologue of warning to those who threaten, dare
We are our father's sons
Together, together we will rise
Unlinked by tangible bonds, molded by misconception
Our cries will be heard, our voices no longer ignored
We are not cattle that can be organized
Those children you mocked, judged
Gathered in their invisible army, ready for the battalions
Listen, listen closely to the muted anthem of women forgetting they inhabit a woman's body,
a man ignorant of his prescribed masculinity
Memorize the lyrics sung by the father's sons.
