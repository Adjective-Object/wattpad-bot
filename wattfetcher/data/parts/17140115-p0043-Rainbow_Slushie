So, I just came home from the theater because I was watching,"Inside Out." Anyways, Pixar knows their feels. I'm not a crying person. It's actually rare to see me cry. I mean, I do feel sad and everything but it's not often that I get so sad that I cry. Throughout the movie, I only shed six to seven tears. I know l sound like a heartless monster but if I let myself cry in public, I'd probably be really emabrassed because I would be sniveling, snotty, mess. Luckily, Â I didn't, meaning I didn't emabrass myself. Anyways, the movie was very feelsy. WHY BINGBONG?! *is crying over Bingbong on the inside* Thanks for reading what I am now considering my online diary. It is basically that though. Okay. Yeah. So... Goodbye.
