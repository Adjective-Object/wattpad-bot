"oh shut up, you little whineass," my brother jake said, finally getting on my last nerve and reducing every calm pulse I made, and had my blood boiling by now.
"you know what, jake, why don't you go piss off," I said making my mother gasp loudly.
"Luke Robert Hemmings!"
"yeah, I get it," I said standing up and shoving my chair in before heading to my bedroom, ignoring my brothers snickers and my moms calls, and slammed my bedroom door shut, and locked it.
he's such a fucking asshole. I swear, sometimes i just want to hit him so had upside the face with a sledge hammer, and not have any regrets afterwards.
after dosing off, and waking up around two, I sighed grabbing my phone. he's such a little brat and I just want to punch him. but i think even if I had the chance, i probably wouldn't. he's my brother after all. plus, he's hella strong.
from: luke jake is such an ass
i quickly typed, and sending it off to my best friend Michael. we talk about everything and anything. I've been best friends with him since grade seven. we've graduated already. actually, i take that back. i graduated already. he dropped out.
from: ***-***-****well he doesn't sound like he is a nice fellow now does he
I read the text and furrowed my brow. what the hell is he even talking about? like what's up with him. is he drunk or something.
from: lukeare you drunk Michael?
from: ***-***-****no, i am not drunk and i am not michael either
realizing when I typed in michaels number, I typed in the wrong two numbers, so obviously I was texting someone else. maybe that's why michaels contact name didn't pop up.
from: lukeoh...oops!
I laughed shrugging my embarrassment off and laid back on my bed. it's cool, the person doesn't even know me so no need to feel embarrassed. it happens. then my phone beeped again.
from: ***-***-****it's okay so who's this ass named jake

from: ***-***-****seems like someone's feelings got hurt, poor baby
