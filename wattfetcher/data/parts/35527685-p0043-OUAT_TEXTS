Ok so this is not an update but my friend and I made a realization I thought you should know. Spoiler if u r not caught up.
In the season 4 finale Charming stabs Hook in the back. We call it the charming stab. Now back in season 1 James dies, He got "Charming stabbed" by the thing he was fighting! The irony!
Thank you for reading this random update that I thought was really cool. I will try and have a real update very soon.
