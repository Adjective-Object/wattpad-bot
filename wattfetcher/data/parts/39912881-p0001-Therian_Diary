Hello, my name is Ralphina. I am a Dire wolf therian. Her eyes are silver, black pelt, and sometimes wear floral decorations. Her name means "wise wolf" and for a reason. I sense pain, happiness, pleasure, lost, abandonment, and joy. I have learned that something's you just have to accept in life. My mother passed away since I was eight and that is when I was awakened. Having a strong connection with animals, especially wolves. I began practicing to howl, bark, and watch wolf documentaries that caught my interest. When I knew something was different about me, I searched the web and found out that I was a therian. A person who spiritually believes that they are born an animal and to have mental, phantom, and sometimes dream shifts about them. I am 15 now, have a mate, great friends and family, and a loyal pack. Hopefully, everything will be okay in the future.
