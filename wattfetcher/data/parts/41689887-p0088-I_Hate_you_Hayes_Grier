I lay my head on Sammy's shoulder, he wraps his arms around me, I blush. They soon call all the names and Sierra was called, she walked up on stage and then walked off with he diploma.
--------
We soon get down from the bleachers, I find Sierra she puts her stuff down and I make a run for it and she catches me spinning me around, "I'm gonna cry." I told her, she rubbed my back and I wrapped my legs around her waist.
"Don't cry." she laughed, "Good job baby." her boyfriend smiled, she looked at him terrified. "Sierra let's talk." her boyfriend said, they walked behind the bleachers, "No, I'm about to kick a*s." I told mom, I heard her cry as I walked towards them.
"What the he// get off my sister!" I yell at him the kick him and punch him till he hit the floor, I helped her up she had a bloody nose, I cleaned that up for her and she had a scratch on her arm.
"Get up." I told the guy as he woke up, I grabbed his collar and Sierra walked on my other side, "I will get you back for this Sierra." he mumbled, "You won't because, she will be far away from you." I said, "Turn yourself in or will be dealt with by me, I grab Sierra's hand.
He walks to the police and we walk with him, Sierra told the story and they took him. She happily walked away and I did too. "Brave huh?" Cameron asked me, "I'm always brave what are you talking about." I said, I smiled as Sammy knocked me off my feet into his arms.
"I see someone has a boyfriend." Sierra said I blushed covering myself in Sammy's neck, "I have to go home tonight." he said, "What?" I asked, he nodded. "I live in a mansion with Taylor and his girlfriend." he said, I frowned nodding.
He carried me to the car Jake was still asleep too, we soon dropped everyone home, I kissed Sammy bye, then it was just Riley, Hayes, Nash, and Cameron.
They walked to their house because it was only across from us. I walked inside, taking off my shoes, taking a quick shower, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and mom made us some hot chocolate, yes I did buy all the guys presents, they were underneath the tree. I play my Christmas music, and Underneath the tree plays by Kelly Clarkson.
I had love marshmallows that actually spelt the word love, in mine and Cameron had hearts, I drunk some of it and gave Jake a treat, Sammy soon texted me.
Sammy❤️-Good night baby, see you tomorrow on Christmas, love you 😘😘
Keegan-Good night Sam, Love you too babe 😘😘😘.

Jake lays next to me and Cameron comes in, "Good night love you." he kissed my forehead, "Good night love you too." I said then kissed his cheek, he rubbed Jake's head and walked out then mom came in, "Sweet dreams, love you." she said I smiled then replied with a love you too.
Sierra walked in and hugged me, "Good night love you." she said, "Love you too." I said she smiled and closed my door a little. I cut off my lights and let the music play.
"Good night Jake." I said, he licked my cheek in his reply, I fall asleep sooner.
