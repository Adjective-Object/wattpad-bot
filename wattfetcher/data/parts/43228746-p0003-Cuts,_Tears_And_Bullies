"Yes. I'm fine," I lied, "Why wouldn't I be?" I asked giving her a fake smile.
"You get notes again?" she asked me with the worried look on her face.
"Nah, I'm okay babe." I chuckled.
Good at acting I can say? I am never truly happy, it's just that some days I'm less sad than the rest.
************
It's recess now.
Audrey get her burger while I drink my apple juice.
I'm not hungry so yeaa
"Audrey, do you want to hangout later?" I asked her.
"Yeah! Sure why not? I almost can't recognice Uncle Harry and Aunt Alli." She chuckled. I laughed back.
"Alright! That's go-" I got interrupted by someone spilling plain water on my skinny jeans. Not again.
I look up, it's that bitch. That always make my life miserable. Chelsea.
"What? What again?!" I yelled at her in the face.
"Woah, calm down. I'm just pouring a drink at your jeans cause it's too dirty, you know?" She laughed. Almost everyone in the canteen heard everything and began to laugh. Great, this is the beginning Ash.
"You have a eyes, right? Then use it properly woman." I snapped.
I quickly get out of my seat and rushed to the toilet crying. As always.
Audrey's P.O.V
What the fuck Chelsea?
"What the fuck?" I asked her.
She just walk away. I grab her wrist and she turn around.
"What are you trying to do? It's the first day of school and you're giving her shits? Just stop and take a break for crying out loud." I said. Everyone just stared at us like it was a drama from the drama club.
"Well, this is hell for her so I will show the real definition of hell, Audrey." She answered wiping 'dirts' off my shoulder.
I rolled my eyes and grab my bag. I ran to the washroom to check on Ashley.
I'm too late.
Yes this is the first day of hell.
