"Liam, who is this lovely girl?"
A woman,most likely in her late 30's, came out of the house. She looked happy but tired at the same time. A man came out too. He looked tired too but it was more obvious and was, I'm guessing, the same age as the woman.
I plot my hands on my hips proving that I was annoyed at Liam for lying to me. I smile though because he tried to usher them back inside saying that I was a someone who's lost.
"I'm Olivia. Liam's friend." I spoke to them. "I came to say hi."
"Liam has friends?" His dad asks jokingly. I smirk at Liam once again.
Liam sighed loudly with frustration. He watched the soccer game like he wasn't part of anything. He leaned on the side of the house and crossed his arms, his arm muscles bulging.
"Liam's cousins are adorable. Do they come over often?" I inquired trying to keep the conversation going.
"Oh, they aren't his cousins, they are-"
"Olivia the Odd! Come on you old hag!"
I only know one human being that would call me that. Only one person that would even think of that name. Only one, that would say that out loud.
Rylan's little brother.
And Liam, his parents, and Liam's cous- or the kids in his yard heard. I wouldn't be surprised if they start calling me that.
I sighed. "I have to go." I mumbled breathlessly.
The last thing I saw was Liam smiling at me. I couldn't tell if it was an amusing smile or a smile that said "See you later." Most likely the first one.
"Just drive me home." I tried to say sternly but came out shaky to Rylan.
