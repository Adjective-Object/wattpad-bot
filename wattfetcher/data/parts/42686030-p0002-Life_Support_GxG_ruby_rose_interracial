Natasha POV
I walked into my house walking upstairs. I tried to think about a shower, TV, eating sleeping! But my mind always seems to wonder to her. I sighed sitting on my bed pulling my phone out looking at the paper. I had to decide whether to text her or just throw the paper away....minutes pass as I think and play with my lip.( It's one of my nervous habits)  finally I copied her number down texting her
Hey it's Natasha. I pressed send and sighed nervously getting up playing with my fingers while walking back and forth. I have NO idea WHY I was so nervous but...I am. I started getting ready to shower when my phone vibrated. I jumped up and down smiling then stopped realizing what I was doing. " cut it out Natasha!". I scolded myself and picked my phone up reading  the message
I'm surprised to hear from you beautiful
The message read. I felt myself blushing and saved her number than texted her back
Me: how come?RubyI didn't think you were interested in me..Me: well miss ruby you were wrong. Ruby:I'm glad to be wrong..hey can you call me?
I froze dropping the phone...call her?? Texting was wayyy different but actually calling her! Well...I guess it couldn't hurt...I called her and sat on my bed. After 2 rings she answered
"Hello?" I heard her adorable accent say I smiled " hey." I replied "What are you doing?" She asked " nothing much...I was about to shower but I wanted to talk to you first.". " Oh really?". She asked I could picture her smiling. I started stuttering " I-I meant..ummm" she laughed " don't sweat it love...I think your cute.". I blushed " thank you ." " well I should let you go ahead and shower...". I frowned and sighed a little " umm...okay I'll. Talk to you later than?". " definitely" she said I hung up and got into the shower.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The next morning I woke up putting in a great mood I checked my phone and saw a text from ruby

I raised an eyebrow and sat up calling her.

After checking my hair I heard a car horn. I took one last check, grabbed my wallet and phone and was out the door.
