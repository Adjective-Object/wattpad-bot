I woke up at 1:30 am.
Me: Seems like nobody's up, I'll take a walk around the house.
Mind: Put your hijab on, you dont know who might be out there, it's a huge house, and btw who actually walks outside his/her house after midnight *face palm*
Me : Ok Ok whatever you say mindy.
I put my hijab on and walked slowly downstairs ..
Mind: don't you want to see the dog ?
Me: Oh yeah yeah , I'll get him or her some food first .
I headed to the kitchen and got some chicken then ran to the garden
"Damonnnn hey doggy doggyy where are you Damonnn?"
"What would a hot chick like you be doing in the middle of the night outside ... by her own " A deep manly voice said behind me, I jumped and turned around, adrinaline started filling my vines which made me run towards the house in a speed I never reached while screaming and asking for help like a freak, but the guy apparently was faster and caught my wrist with one hand and spinned me with the other one to face him.
"Yeah I'm fine. What about you?" He said sarcastically, I slipped from his grip and ran to the house.
"What's wrong? Im trying to get some rest here" Another manly voice said from upstairs, I got frightened and was about to call 911, until I saw him walking toward me with a large smirk , I froze in my place, then the other guy came in.
I forgot to lock the door.
"What the hell is wrong with you babe?" He stepped a bit closer to me then ....
I Fainted.
