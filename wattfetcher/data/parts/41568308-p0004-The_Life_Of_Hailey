So when Zach and Hailey finished eating their pizza, they put up their stuff and went up stairs. It was 6:26 pm, and they were feeling kinda tired. They laid down on the bed, Zach had his arms rapped around Hailey. It was around midnight and, Hailey was crying and kicking and she woke Zach up in the process. He woke her up screaming "Hailey, Hailey, Hailey! Wake up, your having a bad dream!" Hailey woke up and Zach said "It's ok, You just had a bad dream." "Ok." Hailey said. He rapped his arms around her and they fell back to sleep. They woke up that morning, and Hailey woke up and put on her makeup straightened her hair and put on her black waist high shorts and a grey tank top with grey and white Jordan's on. Zach woke yp and put his clothes on and they both went down stairs. Zach sat down after Hailey with a bowl Froot Loops in front of them. Zach said " Mom, we gotta tell you something." " What is it sweety?" " Me, Me, Me and Hailey are, dating!" "Awe, yall are amazing." So when Zach and Hailey finished their Froot Loops they got in Zach's Mom's car and went to school. They noticed that they went to the same school and had 1st and 3rd period together. They remembered seeing each other but never having a deep conversation.
