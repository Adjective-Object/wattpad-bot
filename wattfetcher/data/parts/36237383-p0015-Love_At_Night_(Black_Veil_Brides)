I heard Jake come up the stairs. I frantically looked around the room and dived for the door. I smashed my back up against it as Jake pounded his fists against the door.
"Kat! Its me." Ashley said. I jumped up and opened the door. He stood there with blood on his clothes. He grabbed me and closed the door. The thought of him touching me made my skin crawl. He let me go and sat on the bed. I slipped my dress back on and sat on the edge of the bed. The feelings in my arms and legs were coming back.
"I know I lied but they are dangerous. I only did it because if they were to hurt you.."
"They are werewolves and they wont hurt me." I say looking at Ashley. He shook his head.
"You know one werewolf... well you did." He said. I tried not to think about Andy.
"We are going to be married soon. You need to learn to obey me and stand by me." Ashley said. He held my hand tight. I looked down and nodded slightly. He kissed my forehead and stood up.
"Get some rest while I deal with this little problem downstairs." Ashley smirked before closing the door. I laid down on the bed and drifted off to sleep.
I woke up at night and got up. I slowly walked down the stairs and saw that nobody was home. This was my chance. I opened the door and started walking away. The wind blew hard and the streets were abbandoned. I turned a corner and bumped into someone.
"Sorry..."I said. Andy stood there silent. I looked down at the ground.
"How have you been?" He said. I missed his voice. I cleared my voice before speaking to him.
"Ive been well." I said. He looked and me and moved closer.
"You know what your fianc√® did. He killed two werewolves and what did you do? You did nothing!" He shouted at me.
"I know!" I shouted back. I ran my fingers through my hair. He sniffed the air.
"Hes coming for you..." He said. Ashley knew I would leave the house as soon as I got a chance. I kicked at the ground and sighed. I looked up at Andy who stood before me.
"Please take me. Take me away from all this." I begged him. He grabbed my arm and looked into my eyes.
"Lets go."
