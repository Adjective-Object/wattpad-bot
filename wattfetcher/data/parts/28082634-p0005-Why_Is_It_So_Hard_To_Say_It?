"Well, it is nice... Weird but nice. I think" i said."Oh stop it, ill get blushed" he said gesturing with his hands and laughing."Okay, diva".We laughed a while, then his expression changed. "Wait, how did you buy that?" he asked, pointing at the beer." You arent old enough are you?". "Umm, no, but the man that runs the store kinda knows my dad so... Yeah" i said."Oh, i see" he said. Then i remembered that the boy in the store knew his name so i asked him about it. "Oh, well, unfortunately, i know him from years ago, he is an asshole." Harry said."Pshh nah, really?" i said sarcastically."I swear" he said, following the game.Again we were laughing until i saw the time 7:30. "Oh god! My dad's gonna kill me!" i said, scared. "What? Why?" he asked, kinda worried."Ill tell you later Harry" I said as i started to run home. "See you!" "Wait!" he said as he doodled something in a piece of paper. He runned towards me and gave it to me "Here, call me if you  need something"."Thank you, bye!" I said, still running.
