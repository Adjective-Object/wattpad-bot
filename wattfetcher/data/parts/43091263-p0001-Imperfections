"I think you're beautiful" Aaron texted back.
I didn't know how to reply. I was rarely ever called beautiful. Rejection was often all that was available to me.

Texting the boy I had been staring at in class for months now.
Texting the boy who was sweet from the moment I met him.
Texting the boy who came to my mind whenever a love song came on the radio.
Texting THE boy.
