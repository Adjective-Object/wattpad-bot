Great. Just great. Why, actually. Why do we have to move to England, like it's better than Russia? I would ask, but my mama, the not-giving-an-honest-ukhod-about-her-middle-child kind of person she is, I knew she wouldn't care. She even made me pack my own stuff, but she packed my older and younger sisters' things for them. That's glupyy! Either make them pack their things, too, or pack my stuff, too. Prosto zdorovo.  Just great.
