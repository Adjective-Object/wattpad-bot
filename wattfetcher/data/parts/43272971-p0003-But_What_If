"Bye, mom! Be careful and dad take care! I'll be back!" I yelled as I jogged to the gate, looking back at the house. It wasn't much. We owned a 3 acres land with a blue house. Trees surrounding the house except the gateway. It was beautiful. I turned around to see my mom and my dad waving at me.
"Have fun, Ava! Don't get in too much trouble!" My mom yelled waving at the car behind me but I know she's waving at me. It's just that her right eye is blind so everything is kinda loop sided to her. I se my dad waving at me and I smile back and wave back. I see my sister on the phone in her room. She's probably texting her 'boyfriend'.
I walk to the sidewalk across the street and kept on walking down the road until I arrived to school. I look up and see the sign 'WELCOME TO SUMMER CAMP!' I walk inside to see my best friend Alex running up to me. I run and hugged him smelling in new as he call 'man spray.'
"Ava! I missed you so much! How is your dad doing?" He said with a look of concern on his face. He loved my dad as much as I loved him.
" He's doing fine. You didn't even ask how my summer is. Ugh, talk about rude," I said sarcastically. "like seriously I am your best friend that is female and you pay no attention to me. Wow."
"I'm sorry." He said with those big brown puppy eyes which I am a sucker for.
"Aww! It's okay little Alex."I said hugging his 6'2 foot frame.
" Eww hair! Gosh I sometimes hate that your 5'5. It's getting so annoying but since you love me and my beautiful shiny black hair I forgive you. Oh I forgot to tell you that we are going on the bus in... omg we're late! No wonder anybody's here! Let's go!"
We ran and laugh as I tripped over my hair and how all of his clothes fell out of his backpack.
