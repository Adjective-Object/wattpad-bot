This is a new old OC. She will appear is in Skye's Battle. But I left out some details so I wouldn't give her away. It's most likely a new character that I'm gonna add in the book. Also, Skye's Battle will be updated soon. But one question for an upcoming chapter, should Skye kill one one again over possession or should she be framed? I really need help deciding so please answer. This is your change to have a say in the book.
