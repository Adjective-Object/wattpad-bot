"Sorrrrrrry Maddy" he says in a baby voice.
I ignore it.
"If you here then I'm guessing Clifford is?"
"Ha! he's too busy rading the fridge" he shouts.
"Typical" I reply.
I make my way into the kitchen and see Michael stuffing himself with basically everything from our fridge.
I couldn't help but laugh.
"Hey mads!" He says in between bites.
"Hi mikey" I laugh again.
We sit down beside him.
"So I hear you'll be joining us on tour this summer?"Calum says.
"You bet!" I reply whilst scrolling down my Instagram feed.
"Should be a blast" Michael says excitedly , just as Ashton walks in.
"Ashton you could of told me these noobs were coming over i would of avoided the fact that Calum nearly gave me heart failure"!
"That would of just spoilt the fun mads"
They all laugh accept me.
"Dick" I mumbled.
Ashton started making a sandwich, Calum was playing with our dog Cassie and Michael was on Twitter. I took this as a good opportunity to ask about the other guy ............ Luke hemmings.
"Um guys can I ask you something?"
They all nodded and mumbled a few yea's.
"Why do you's never hang out with Luke"? It came out more as a desperation question but I really didn't mean it too.
"Oooh does Madison have a crushy on lukey?" Calum mimicked.
"wtf Calum! Im just curious you guys are always together and I've never met this Luke guy before"
{I have to admit Luke was pretty fine. Madison no stop!}
I snapped out of my thoughts when Ashton spoke.
"Luke lives a long way from here so we hardly ever see him just in the studio and on tour"
"Oh" I simply said.
"But don't worry mads ... You'll see him on tour!" Michael winked.
They both laughed , while Ashton tensed up.
I laughed and walked back up to my room.
"Luke Hemmings .....Interesting" I smirked to myself.
I really hope you enjoyed chapter 1 ðŸ˜˜
