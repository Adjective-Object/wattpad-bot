I smile absently, while she babbles about how his cheekbones looked under the street lamps. She was always very lucky with boys, she's already dated so many. And then there's me, whose never had my first kiss yet. I sigh.
"What about you?" she asks all of a sudden, breaking me from my thoughts.
"Huh?"
"You're still not interested in anyone?" she looks at me expectantly.
"Uh, no. Not really, the boys in this town aren't really my type." I mumble, looking away from her heavy gaze.
"Oh, c'mon. There has to be at least one guy that you think is hot?" she pushes.
I sigh, I seem to do that a lot these days. "No, I'm telling you. They're all so... similar."
She smiles sympathetically. "Oh, don't worry, babe. You'll find a special one, one day." She puts her hand over mine, and squeezes it.
It's only 30 minutes later that I leave Starbucks, it's still raining heavily as I pull out my umbrella. On the way home, I'm lost in my thoughts, reminiscing the earlier events and that discussion with Liz. As soon as I get home, I run up the stairs, eager to find the comfort of my own room. I sit on my bed and get ready to press play and continue my The Vampire Diaries marathon, when a noise catches my attention. I pull out my earphones, Bartholomew meows.
"Shush, you." I tell him, he glares at me with all the sass of a Persian cat. I stand up and go up to my window where the noise is more distinct. I squint in the darkness and that's when I see him. He's sitting in his bed, strumming the chords on his guitar and singing with that voice. The houses in my neighborhood are close to each other, so I'm used to hearing him sing at night, but I never get over how mesmerizing he sounds. You can practically hear the passion in his singing, the way he closes his eyes and tilts his head when he hits a high note. My heart leaps in my chest, I listen closer, trying to make out the words.
"Turns out that no one can replace meI'm permanent, you can't erase meI'll help you remember meOne more kiss is all it takesI'll leave you with the memoryAnd the aftertaste"
