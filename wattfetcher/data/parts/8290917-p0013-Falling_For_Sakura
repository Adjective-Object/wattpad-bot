"There they go again," Darcy said, shaking his head.
Sebastian wasn't taking it and had the urge to give them the finger but managed to control himself. Then just when he thought it wouldn't get any more annoying, Tristan honked at him five times, waking up Conrad, who also got very annoyed.
"I think I want to kill him now," Conrad muttered, glaring at the car in front of them.
"Stay calm now. There's no need to be childish," Nicolas said, typing away on his tablet.
"I see trouble coming," Darcy murmured under his breath, knowing very well how Sebastian would respond to the challenge.
On cue, Sebastian felt adrenaline rushing in his blood. He stomped his foot on the accelerator. He quickly changed lanes and overtook the black car in front of them with ease. When he saw the shocked look on Tristan's face, Sebastian smiled with satisfaction and sped up even more. He laughed, knowing very well he had left his brothers in his dust once again.
"Good job, Seb." Conrad chuckled.
"You guys still haven't grown up," Nicolas said under his breath.
"Better slow down, Seb," Darcy said, noting they were going way too fast.
A split second later, it happened. The car turned a corner onto a narrow road, which was covered by thick woods on both sides. Before he knew it, Sebastian quickly stepped on the brake, his heart pounding with dread as the car headed straight toward the person who suddenly materialized as if out of the blue onto the middle of the road.
"Holy shit!" Conrad shrieked.
"Watch out!" Darcy shouted.
