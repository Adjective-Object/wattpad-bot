Austin: You were raped?!
Quadira's P.O.V.
I was in the living room with Sam just having a conversation until we got interrupted by shouting coming from the bathroom. We sat there in silence listening to the conversation. Then we heard Amanda shout at Austin, "I WAS RAPED!!!! THERE I SAID IT, HAPPY?!" We both stood there in shock about what we just heard.
Austin's P.O.V.
I can't believe was raped, when did this happened? Why didn't she tell me? So many thoughts went through my mind, I wasn't thinking straight.
Me: Why didn't you tell me this? When did this happened?
Amanda: Because I knew you was gonna react like this. It happened a week ago, last Monday.
I broke out in tears and hugged her. I grabbed her hand and walked out of the bathroom to see Quadira and Sam just sitting there with a shocked  expression on their faces. We walked to the couch and I had Amanda sit down on the couch and me on my knees in front of her.
Me: I don't know how to react to this. Did you get to see who it was?
Amanda: Yeah, but I don't want to tell you.
Me: Tell me, you need to tell me!
