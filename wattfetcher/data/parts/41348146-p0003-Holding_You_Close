Minty gum...mmh
"Oi!" I screeched pushing me away from him and his eyes became slightly darker than they just were. "Just tell me where the freaking class is."
"Sure whatever. It's right here." He told me with a bored tone.
"Thank you." I said and then I took a seat in the middle row of chairs.
All the classes dragged by pretty quickly, which I was thankful for. Launch, however, was pretty lonely.
I walked out of the doors and travelled down the sidewalk to my house and once I got inside I let my body collapse onto my lavender bed.

I woke up the next morning and got ready. I'm wearing a white flowy crop top that says in thick black letters 'Coffee, Please' and some dark wash jeans with my black combat boots. I tied my hair up into a messy bun. After I ate I walked to school.
When I walked in everything was the same as it was yesterday, I just didn't walk into a Jock-Slut. In fact I didn't even really see him today. I saw him at launch at a table that his friends were at.
I walked out the doors one more time and...wow, seriously Sierra?
"Sorry!" I screech at the person I just bumped into.
"Gee, you better stop running into me or else I'm gonna think your doing it on purpose." Tyler says with that cocky smirk of his causing me to groan and storm away from him.
Once I got home, I laid in bed, bringing my MacBook with me and went on Pinterest. That didn't last long though, because soon after I found my eye lids become extremely heavy so I gave in and went into a deep slumber.
