"People knock on the door" I glared at her.
"Whatever, I have a great news for you" She smiled
"No, I have a great news for you" I smiled wider.
"I know that you're gonna stay, I was with Damon when he called your father. Now to my good news : We are invited to a sleepover"
"What is a sleepover? I didn't read it in the dictionary"
"A girl invited us to have 'girls night' and to sleep in her house" She clapped
"Oh, I don't know ... Who is she?" I asked
"Molly"
"Why didn't she tell me" I asked
"Because you left early and she didn't see you today" Elina explained.
"I don't know" I sat on my bed.
"Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease, Do I have to put that puppy face" She begged on her knees
"Okay Okay but ..." I rolled my eyes
"What ? ask for anything"
"You need to find me a job" her jaw dropped.
"Why" She frowned.
"Because dad is punishing me, now I need a job that pays me 200 dollars at least"
"How am I supposed to find that job for you"
"It's up to you" I started to unpack my bags.
"you can teach" She smiled.
"Are you serious"
"Yes, private lessons, you are a genius"
"No, I barely stand learning, how can I teach ?"
"Babysitter ?"
"No"
"house-keeper ?"
"Shut up"
"accountant ?"
"maybe ?"
"Okay, now we have to find a place that gives good salaries" She scratched her nose.
"How about Stylish & modest , the one I got my clothes from"
"oh yeah ! I saw a paper that said We need female employees"
"What are we waiting for, let's go"
"Does that mean we're going to Molly ?" I nodded.
"OH YEAH BEST SISTER IN THE WORLD" Here comes the crazy monkeyish Elina.
"DAMON" I shouted, he came in a blink.
"I'm all yours babe"
"Don'tÂ over react, we need a ride"
"Where?" He raised an eyebrow.
"You stole my eyebrow move you thief" They burst in laughter.
"I'm going to have a job in the clothes store we were in two days ago"
"What ? Why ? We can give you money, we have a lot of it"
"Thank you, I don't need anything from you Mr.bragging, my father said he won't support me much so I need to work"
"Okay let's go" He brought his car keys then we followed him to it.
"I want to drive" I said, both of them stared at me.
