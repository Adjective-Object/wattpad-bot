Riker met us outside of the gate. He was too distracted by his phone so Cora ran up to him and jumped on his back. "RIKEY!!!" She screamed. He jumped a little but eventually laughed and hugged her. "CORAL!!!" He mimicked her as they hugged. He kissed her head and squeezed her. "I've missed you so much." He said in her ear. "I missed you too, but I need air" he let go and she laughed.
We claimed our luggage and drove home not expecting the surprise behind the door.
