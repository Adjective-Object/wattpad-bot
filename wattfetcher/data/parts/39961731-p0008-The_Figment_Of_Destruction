I stayed in my room for the whole day. I survived off of my phone, music, and my personal food supply. When I woke up this morning, I tried my best at ignoring my family and just get to school. When I got to school, I saw Lily run to me in her incredibly high heels.
"Hi!" Lily squealed. I don't understand how girls can squeal like that.
"Hey." I said surprisingly.
"Did you do it?" She asked.
"Do what? I just got here."
"Oh. I'm guessing you don't remember. I'll tell you again." She said. I nodded my head. "I want to ask out Jesse, but he's hard to come onto. Yesterday, you said that you would help me."
"Oh. That. Ok. When I find him, I'll ask him for you."
"Thank you, Charlie." Lily left happily while Alex and Max ran to me.
"Bro. What happened?" Alex asked.
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"Lily was talking to you about something. What was it?" Max explained.
"Oh. I have to ask out Jesse for her." I answered.
"Really? Are you jealous?" Max asked.
"What?! Why would I be jealous? Jesse and I are just friends." I informed.
"He doesn't think so." Alex argued.
"Yeah. Why won't you accept that?" Max asked.
"Because it's not true." I responded. "Now, I have to go find Jesse. You guys coming?"
"No. It's alright." Max and Alex said.
"Okay. Bye." I walked down the hall and found Jesse with his group of friends. They were joined in a circle, so I decided to go in the and pop out in the middle.
"Hey!" I shouted as all the guys stared at me.
"Hey, Charlie." All of the guys replied.
"What are you doing here?" A guy named Shawn asked. He's the leader of The Athletes.
"Oh. You know. Just poppin' in." I replied.
"Come on, Charlie." Another guy named Justin spoke up. "What are you really doing here?"
"Fine. I need to talk to Jesse." I answered.
"Ok, then. Bro, go talk to her." Shawn said. I got out of the group along with Jesse.
"Hey." I spoke up.
"Hey." Jesse replied. "So what do you want to tell me?"
"Oh. I was talking to Lily earlier and she wants me to tell you something."
"What is it?"
"She wanted me to tell you that she really likes you and she wants to go out with you. So... what do you say?"
"My answer to that is... no."
"What? Why?"
"I don't like her like that. Plus, girls are asking me out a lot lately."
"That's not a valid reason for you saying no."
"Hey! I wasn't finished. I've had my eye on this one beautiful girl who confuses me a lot."
"Ok. I guess that's a valid reason." I said. He raised an eyebrow at me. "I don't know. I've never had to deal with this nor do I want to."
"You're confusing." Jesse laughed. I laughed along with him. Then I stopped for a second. He said his crush was confusing and he just said that I was confusing... So? That doesn't mean anything. I went back to laughing with him.
