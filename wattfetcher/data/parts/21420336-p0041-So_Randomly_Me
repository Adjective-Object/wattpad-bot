Day 1
~the cousins~
I am currently trapped in my room with Only Divergent, my phone, and netflix to keep me company.
I can live... No I can't. The lies, I can't lie to myself. It's all over.
Gosh I should be an actor i can be so dramatic XD
Yeah so my cousins mom is giving birth so they are here.
So I have like .... Four cousins... + .... Four sisters.....+ two parents....+.....a dog .... +..... And two parakeets....= 13 people in my house who I have to avoid....
Great. Perfect. I love life.
Nico: the sarcasm is real.
Anyways, I wanna rant about divergent....
