Rachel's PovI can't believe it.... Shawn cheated on me! He just kissed Mahogany! I thought we were more then that... The story keeps repeating in my head...##########################It was our 1st year anniversary and Shawn took me to Canada's Wonderland. I just can't believe Shawn Mendes was interested in me! I mean, I thought I was just another fan to him. "Hey muffin, I'll be right back okay?" Shawn said to me."Yeah okay, I'll be here" . He sent me a glance , almost looked upset.. Whatever he would tell me wouldn't he? Yeah. ~9 minutes later ~Where is he? Oh no.. Dang it! I suck at being alone.. It's okay Rachel , Shawn will be right back, you'll be okay.. Oh gosh darn it! I get up and begin to search for him. Nope.. Can't see him anywhere near the washroom.. I turn around and see two people my age kissing, get a room people! I get closer to them.. Mahogany?!? What? I thought she had a boyfriend! Wait, is that.. Is it.. Oh my gosh.. SHAWN?" Shawn?" I ask. He turns around "Muffin I-"" No, just d-don't talk to me, I knew I was j-just another fan to you" I stuttered and ran. I knew it was too good to be true.###########################I pick up my phone, I need to call someone. My hands almost type in Shawn, it's a habit. I have 23 missed calls and 52 texts, all from him. Mahogany would be the one I called, but obviously she isn't as good of a friend as I thought. I look at the next contact, Julianna. I'll call her and then get her to call the others.The phone began to ring...Ring, ring, ring... " Hey Ray Ray, what's up?" She answered." hi.. I need to tell you something, really important to me.." I say weakly." What's wrong?!" I tell her the story from beginning to end."Wow. Let's go do something! I'll call the others and explain, you don't need him, we got this"" Thanks... I'd like that, but what do we do?""Let's go on a journey "
Julianna's PovI called True, Alyssa, Lynsey and Khamelia and they all are ready to go on this journey I planned. Rachel loves road trips so I planned that we go on one.. A LOOOONNNGGG ONE!! I'm so excited! Shawn can go suck something. If Parker (my boyfriend) ever cheated on me.. He'd never be able to have children (ðŸ˜‚) .. EVER! I'm surprised Ray let him off like that.~KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK~Yay! They're here! I ran downstairs tripping on the last step."Ouch" I said rubbing my head. I got up, dusted myself off and opened the door."HI!" True screamed, really loudly, it sorta hurt."Hi!! Are you packed up?""Yup, I over packed!" She laughed."Good! Well, I guess that's good. Are the others coming soon?" I asked stepping out of the way so she could walk in."Yeah, Alyssa is saying bye to Nash, he isn't pleased with it, I mean he's mad about Shawn but he doesn't want Alyssa leaving. Same with Matteo (True's bf) and Zac( Efron, Khamelia 's bf)." You think Parker was? Nuh uh hun! But we got to do this, for Rachel!" I screamed trying to get some sort of rant going, it didn't work... Awkward." Uh okay. So have a seat there and we'll wait for the others".~KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK~"Hi! Nash wouldn't let me go so he's here." Alyssa said. I looked behind her, he wasn't there.. What?Alyssa pointed down, and there he was wrapped around her leg. Gosh. He's so clingy, I don't know how Alyssa puts up with itðŸ˜‚. I bent down on one knee so I was looking at him."Hey Nash?" He nods." Do you want to come with us?" He nods."Okay come on in" I say and he pops up." Hey what's up?" Are you kidding me right now?" Nothing much just come in" they walk in and sit down. Just before I close the door Khamelia shows up with Zac, gosh are all the guys coming? Lynsey shows up, alone. At least Ray and I aren't the only ones .Everyone comes in and now we're just waiting on Rachel.We wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. And wa-~KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK ~FINALLY. I run to the door and open it up."Shawn?" What was he doing here. He looks a mess! His hair hasn't been brushed in what looks like forever, his clothes wet, bags under his red puffy eyes." I-is Rachel here?" He asks weakly."No. Why do you even care?" " I need to explain that it wasn't me, I never wanted to do it"" YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED YOURSELF SHAWN! YOU HURT HER, BAD, AND NOW YOU THINK YOU CAN RUN BAC-"" IT WAS LIFE OR DEATH FOR HER OKAY?" He screamed over top of me. "Is Shawn here? Oh my lord imma bout to beat up on his a**. He hurt my llama friend oh my-" "KHAMELIA! Let him talk please!" " okay fine" she walked away."Sorry what were you saying?" " okay uh.. I was planning my day with Rachel and Mahogany came up to me. She said this guy wanted to talk to me. She looked scared so I took the phone, the guy said I had to kiss Mahogany to make it look like I was cheating on her. If I didn't he said he would hurt her, bad, I messed up and I'm nothing without her.. Please help me?"" Shawn?" A weak voice said, I looked behind him, it was Rachel."What are you doing here?" She asked getting mad." I uh- I " he stuttered." Rachel please let him talk"" I'm not ready yet, please, I promise when I'm ready, you can talk to me." Dang it." I-okay" he looked over at me "thanks" walked by Rachel and left. This plan has totally changed. No more trying to get her away, I'm going to try to get her back.. With Shawn.----------------------------------------------
