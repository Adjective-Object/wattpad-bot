Safely in the car and away from the flashing cameras, Connor and Kevin finally relaxed.
"Hey Connor." Kevin said.
Connor looked over at Kevin and watched him pull something out of the pocket inside his suit jacket. He tossed a clump of fabric to Connor who smoothed it out and smiled brightly when he realized what it was.
Kevin had stolen one of the slip covers off of the Book of Mormon pillows.
"Oh my god, Kevin this is so cool!" Connor exclaimed. He turned to smile at Kevin, not knowing that Kevin had moved closer to him to see the cover.
Their faces were only a few inches apart now, but neither of them moved.
Kevin's eyes searched Connor's face, traveling over his soft features.
Suddenly the door opened and Arnold climbed into the car. Kevin and Connor fell away from one another quickly.
Arnold got comfortable in his seat. "Thomas got in the car with Mr. Church, so we can go now." He said.
The driver hit the gas and the town car merged into the slow-moving traffic.
They rode along in silence for awhile until Arnold spoke up nervously. "Does Nabonjovi ever talk about me?" He asked.
"Who?" Kevin asked in an irritated tone. Connor realized that this was one of Kevin's "tells" and he rested his hand on Kevin's knee to soothe him.
"He means Nabulungi."
"Oh."
Kevin stared at Connor's hand and quieted down. His breathing, which was usually fast and nervous, calmed slightly.
"I'm not sure if Naba talks about you, Arnold, but there's definitely something there between you two. I think you should ask her to dinner." Connor said.
Arnold nodded and puffed out his chest. "I can do it, I'll man up and ask Nabalalungi out on a date."
"You got this buddy, just call her Naba though, okay?"
"I almost got it that last time though, right?"
"Not quite."
