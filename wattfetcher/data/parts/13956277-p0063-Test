I closed my eyes preparing myself for the big crash.
"GotCha" I gasped, a pair of strong arms wrapped me at the perfect time.
I looked around and saw Lewis punching the boy that held his girlfriend while Damon took over the other one ...
WAIT. Whose arms are these ?????
I turned my head to see a hard chest with a tanned face above with some light gray eyes and a sharp jaw ... Simon !
"Simon ?"
"Hey Leena" We forgot about the fight behind us while I was staring in his magnificent  eyes waiting for him to understand and put me down.
"I'm fine now, you can put me down, thank you" I said.
"Oh yeah sorry" My feet landed gently on the ground.
"Take that and that" Lewis kept kicking the boy while Elina was trying to calm him down.
My eyes saw another creeping scene "Damon, that's enough" I said. My voice woke him up, the boy's face was covered with blood.
I heard some shouts "Simon !!! Let him go" I pulled Simon off Conor.
"Let's go before I kill him" Simon breathed heavily, His fists were clenched, his gray eyes turned darker, his face has changed its color as well.
"You'll pay for it" Conor struggled to stand on his weak kicked feet.
"Oh shut up" Simon gave him one last punch on the face that made him sleep on the pavement like a little baby.
"Stop Simon" I caught his hand right when he was about to give him some more.
His brown eyes stared at mine for seconds, they made me loose my balance. That boy was way more handsome than words can describe
"Leena I-" I woke up from my day dream and pulled my hand away from his when his caressed mine.
"Sorry" I stepped back.
"All I cause is troubles, I'm really sorry, I really am a troublemaker. You shouldn't have stepped in" I rubbed my face.
"It's Okay, let's just go before they wake up" Damon said and we followed him.
"Did you follow us" I asked.
"We heard Miley talking with Conor on the phone and planning to make you pay" Lewis wiped his bleeding lip.
"I wasn't expecting that from you Lewis" I nodded
"You're one of us now" Simon said and I felt Damon tense.
"Speak for yourself, I just came because I saw my precious girlfriend" Lewis hugged Elina.
"Sooooo Elina *cough*" Damon interrupted their hug.
"You should go home" I told Lewis and Simon, I still for some reason dont want anybody to know that I live with the Carters.
"It's a rude way to say goodbye, after all ... we actually saved your life" Lewid faked some tears.
"Oh please, excuse me princess"
"I think we should take you home, maybe some of his friends are still following you" Simon said worriedly.
"N-No it's Okay thank you"
"No, we won't rest until you get in your house" Simon frowned, I glared at Damon
