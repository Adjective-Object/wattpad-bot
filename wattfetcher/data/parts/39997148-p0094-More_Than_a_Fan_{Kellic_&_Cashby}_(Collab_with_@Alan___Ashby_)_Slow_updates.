"What do you mean by weird ones?" Vic asked him.
"Just go on my website and look."
"I think I'm with Aust I don't even want to know at this point."
"Well Austin looks at most of my pictures anyway."
"Yeah most of them but I've never seen any weird ones."
"You haven't yet."
"I'm kind of scared to see them- babe, why are you even taking weird pictures?" I asked him.
"Cause I can and it just happens sometimes." He shrugged.
"Well then."
"They're still good pictures."
"Of course they are, you took them."
He smiled at me and gave me a kiss. "You're sweet." He said pulling away.
"I know."
"I have to go work on my project guys. I'll see you all later." He said kissing me once more before walking off.
"I really don't like him working with that asshole." Kellin muttered crossing his arms.
"I don't either." I mumbled.
"He better not hurt Alan again."
'What has he done to him?"
"He always bossed Alan around and basically controlled his life I mean he didn't even like me being around him, he was really abusive to him too I don't even know how many times I've seen Alan with a black eye and stuff."
"Why wouldn't Alan leave him? Especially if he hit him." I said my heart breaking at the thought of him ever being hurt like that.
"He thought that's how it was supposed to be, he was in love with him. I tried to get him to break up with the dick all the time but he always told me I didn't know, that I'd never been in love or whatever."
"Wow. Do you know if he ever tried leaving before?"
"He tried once and Roy beat him up pretty bad. He called me and when I got there I ended up calling 911."
"And the ass didn't get arrested? What the fuck!?"
"Alan wouldn't press charges on him."
"Oh my god that bastard manipulated him."
"Basically." Kellin sighed, "That's why I really don't like him doing this project with him."
"Do you think he'll get into his head again?" I questioned. What if he does and I lose Alan.
"I don't know. I really hope not." He said shaking his head.
I got up and walked back to the bunks hearing him on the phone again but laughing loudly. I frowned before walking back to them.
"Sorry." I muttered sitting back down.
"It's fine, what was he doing?" Vic asked me.
"He's on the phone with him again..."
"Gross."
"Yeah and laughing... I don't get it he just was a complete dick to him and now it's like nothing happened."
"That's usually how it is with them. Roy will be a complete dick then apologize and Alan will forgive him and act like he did nothing wrong."
I sighed, "I'm gonna lose him aren't I?"
