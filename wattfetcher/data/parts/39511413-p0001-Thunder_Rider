"MOM, I'M GOING TO RIDE RIPPER!" I yell. I walk outside and go to Ripper's pen. "Hey, boy. How are you?"I step inside the pen and pat the big gray stallion.I brush him then put my barrel saddle on him. I put on a bridle and lead Ripper to the fence. I tighten my cinch then climb the fence and get on Ripper.It is easier to use the fence to get on Ripper because he is 18.6 hh.
I give Ripper a small tap and he starts walking. We go to the arena, and I warm Ripper up. After Ripper is warmed up, I open the gate and walk out.Ripper crouches down and gets ready to run. I cluck and give him a kick and he races into the arena.He turns around the first barrel and heads for the next barrel.Right then, a huge bird flies by. Ripper spooks and I fly off.I check myself for injuries and find I can't move my right arm. Might be broken, I think. I stand up and catch Ripper. I take him back to his pen and carefully take off his tack with my left arm. I scratch his withers and walk to the house. I walk into the kitchen and find my mom making lunch."Ripper spooked and I hurt my arm.""Do you think it's broken?""I don't know... Maybe.""Well, let's go into town and get it looked at."
We get in our truck and drive into town.The doctor looks at my arm.
" It is fractured," he says, looking at the x-rays.
I get a cast and we leave.
On the way back to the house, I hear a voice say "Get ready" in my head.I wonder what it is.
Back at the house, I feed the goats and horses, then get ready for bed.
I quickly fall asleep.
A/N: Sorry for The short chapter. Next one is longer. Ripper is pictured.
