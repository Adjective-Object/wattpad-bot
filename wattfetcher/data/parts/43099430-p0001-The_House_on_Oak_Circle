"You're right." said Lily with a disgusted look on her face. There were cobwebs and dust everywhere. Not to mention the rat droppings. At that moment, Lily got shivers down her spine. "Let's get out of of this place. It gives me the creeps."

"We've made a lot of prog"- BANG! "What was that?" They said in unison. "It sounded like it came from upstairs" said Lily. "You should go check it out." "Why me?!" Fran said "Because you're a boxer. You're strong." "Thanks" he said " I guess I could go."when he got up stairs he screamed. He saw a black outline of a figure staring out the window. When it looked over at him,he sprinted down the stairs. "What happened?" Lily asked, worried. There was a black thing up there and it Saw me!" He said, out of breath.
