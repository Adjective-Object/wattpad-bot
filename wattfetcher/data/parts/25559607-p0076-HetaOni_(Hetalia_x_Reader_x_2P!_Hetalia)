"To whom?" I asked, genuinely curious.
"Well you see it's because o--..." ____ suddenly stopped when she began to stagger a little.
I took a few steps closer to her. "A-Are you alright?"
She nodded, but held her head like she was in pain. "...Yeah...I'm sorry...I can hear....someone... no... I-I need to tell you..."
_____ started to lose consciousness and almost collapsed on the floor. Good thing, Prussia caught her.
"F-FRAU!"
"____-chan??! What... "
"....26..."
"Huh?"
"....I found out...th-that....there will a-actually...."
"_____!...Hold on...don't push yourself..."
".....th-there will actually be 26 people...in this mansion...."
"N-Nani?! Wait...but there's just...there's just 11 of us here!"
"...T-Two pl--"
Before she could finish what she was saying, she lost consciousness.
"I'll..I'll carry her. You take her bag.  Let's go to where West and Italy are and get _____ out of here! C'mon let's go!" Prussia instructed with a panicked expression on his face.
I have so many things to tell him, but didn't know how to start, so I started rambling, "Listen! That place is dangerous. If--If we go to that place, Germany will--Ah, I mean, you would be risking your own life, too... and even Italy--"
"State your opinion precisely and concisely. You think too much. That's why you're forgetting something simple!" he told me.
I pondered on what he just said. "... Something simple."
Carrying _____ on his back, Prussia faced me with a serious expression and spoke, "First you remembered one thing! When you're that worried about stuff, you should tell people. You have to let us work together and give yourself some breathing space. Look at frau here, she's been bottling up soo much ever since she came here...and it looks like it's been taking out a lot of on her with all the stress...I'll give you points if you remember one more thing. Now, let's go."
"R-Right!"
Prussia leaves the room swiftly but carefully, carrying ______.

Since I've glimpsed so many possibilities...I'm sure the Thing has got stronger.
With an enemy that grows progressively stronger... What can I possibly do...?

Prussia and I arrived at the tunnel-like place in the basement where the rope ladder was located.
"West!! We need to get _____ out of this place, now!" Prussia frantically told his brother.
Germany turned with a concerned look forming on his face. "W-What happened to her?"
"She suddenly fainted while we were talking." his older brother told him.
"Oh no.. Then we better get bella out of here, quick." Italy said.
Germany then started running forward. "Then I'll go on ahead so that I can assist Prussia in bringing ____ up."
