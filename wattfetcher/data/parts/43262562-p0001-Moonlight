The silky white curtains sway in the breeze, the churning of waves keep me wide awake. Its been like that ever since my parents died last spring, now I live with my older sister Piper and her stupid boyfriend Damon and its been hell. Once again I feel the sudden excitement rush through me when the breeze lightly taps my face and then I black out.
The irritating sound of my sister and Damon chatting wakes me up at 7:38 I quickly get dress into denim overalls and underneath I wore a black an white striped shirt. To my annoyance I see my sister making out with Damon, its disgusting it look as if hes trying to swallow her throat " Morning" I shout in my fake joyous tone, they instantly break apart. "Ridley" they both say in unison " what are you doing up this early" said Piper flicking her blonde hair over her shoulder "school" I say " anyway gotta run see ya" I slam the front door, firstly I know what your thinking Ridley are you serious, but yeah it is my name. I run on the path smelling the scent of ocean on my way to school.
I slow my pace as I walk quietly around the queen bee Clarissa, her tan skin is perfect her platinum blonde hair is silky, but her attitude is shit. So far Clarissa has had around 15 boyfriends and school only had just started. " Ridley" squealed my best friend Allie alongside her was my other best friend Theresa, way to be quite Â I thought. " Did it happen again are you OK did you tell Piper are you OK wait I already said that ugh"blurted out Allie without any breath, " shh shut up, follow me"I whispered.
"What happened" asked Theresa, " I said shut up" I replied "What part of shut up do you not understand, it literally means shut and then up" I said harshly," Sorry guys I didn't mean that"I said. "And yes it happened" I whispered
