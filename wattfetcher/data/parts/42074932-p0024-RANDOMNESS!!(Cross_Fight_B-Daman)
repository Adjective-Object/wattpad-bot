Katsumi:*reading a book*
Kamon:Ugh..Since when did u read books.Did u turn to a book worm?!
Katsumi:No!This is the same book I always read!
Kamon:Nancy Drew?
Katsumi:Yup.
Kamon:Well its midnight.Lets go to sleep.
Katsumi:Im sleeping at the top this time!
Kamon:Aww....fine!
Katsumi:Good night!

I made Kamon and Katsumi roomates.They sleep in a double decker bed.Its kinda scary sleeping at the top.What if you fall?When I went to camp I sleep at the bottom cause the top is cold.There a fan!
