note the sarcasm
" come on I have something for you to change into "  justin said leading me upstairs to his room
I looked around and noticed his normal  room which has changed quite a bit it used to be a  Bart Simpson on the wall I'm glad he got rid of that lol its kinda  weird not saying I don't like the Simpsons but I wouldn't put them on my wall for everyone to see  then justin dug through his drawers and threw me a shirt at me  and  walked over to the  me  and kissed my forehead
" I'll ask my mom if she has a pair of pants  cause I thought you left a pair but you didn't " he said pressing his forehead against mine and pulling me against his wet suit which was even colder I walked downstairs and justin followed behind me
" mom do you have a pair of pants Kylie can borrow" he asked
" yeah upstairs " she  answered
" ok" I said running upstairs into Pattie's room  and   walking into her closet and finding a pair and sliding them off the hanger and heading into the bathroom  to change
I stripped out the wet dress and  dried off any water on my body and slid Justin's shirt on and then slid into Pattie's  pants that she let me borrow and used a towel to dry my now curly hair   then grabbed my wet dress   and  the now wet towel and  walked out  and bumped into a shirtless justin  in his boxers
"  hey watch it " he   grumbled but stopped dead in his tracks once he realized  what I was wearing
" you look good in my shirt " he said raising an eyebrow  and staring at me from head to toe
"   better than you do" I smirked
"  I doubt it " he teased back
"  hey watch it " I said pointing a finger
" hey you started it " he said raising his hands in defense
" go put some clothes on" I said pushing him  towards his room
" kiss first " he pleaded sticking out his bottom lip
" no go" I said pointing and trying not to laugh and his face
Ok that sounded harsh  but I didn't mean it that way
"Ok miss bossy pants " he said walking off to get dressed
I giggled to myself then walked down stairs to Pattie
"  Pattie " I called out
" down here sweetie "  she called back
Oh no stairs ok I guess I never told you I'm terrible with stairs I hate them oh my god
" come on sweetie I'm downstairs " Pattie called
" would you mind coming up here " I called out
