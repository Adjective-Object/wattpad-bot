"Hey Haz, how is things between you and Jade." Louis asked, taking the water bottle from my hand then he walked away.
"Idiot." I mumbled, taking another bottle. We worked for another few hours, we recorded Fireproof, 18, Where Do Broken Hearts Go and Spaces. We decided to release Fireproof after 3 days days. I went home and took a long shower to remove all the stress from today and clear my mind 'cause we were having an interview tonight. I went out and decided to take a small nap.
I woke up and I had 1 hours to go, I wore a pair of tight black jeans and a green t-shirt, I brushed my messy hair and took my phone and keys. I said goodbye to mum and Gemma the  I headed to the house that I use to share with the boys. I didn't take my car, I decided to walk, I wondered how was Jade is now and what happened to her mother. I arrived and we all got into the limousine, while I was checking my twitter, unknown number had texted me.
From the unknown :
Stay away from Jade, I'm warning you!!
It left me worried and confused. I wonder who is that unknown number and what he or she wants from me, why did he/she told me to stay away from Jade.
