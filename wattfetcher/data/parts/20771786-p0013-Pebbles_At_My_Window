"Hey pick her up, would you!" She spoke to Marcus and pushed him to the ground as well and I think it's safe to say that damn he is heavy!
He landed on me which let out an "Ooft" sound from me. I moaned from his bulky body and he started laughing.
"What the fuck are you laughing at?" I ask admiring his facial features.
"Your moan reminded me of our dance at the Halloween party." he whispers to me and pushes himself off the ground.
Our dance? I danced with Marcus? I moaned? What the hell?
Then it all came back to me. The hip moving, the drinking, the horse head guy, the grinding, the neck kissing!
"Oh my god, I, Marcus I'm-"
"Stop, I loved our dance." he handed me his hand which I held on to.
He liked me acting like a complete moron? Whatever, suit yourself.
