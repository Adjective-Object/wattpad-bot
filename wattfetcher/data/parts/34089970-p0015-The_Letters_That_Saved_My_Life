Right now I feel nothing at all,
I'm just numb,
Should I be worried?
I feel no emotions,
Not one at all,
Nothing,
I just feel like I'm wasting space,
I feel almost invisible,
I feel like nothing matters,
What's the point?
Right now there is not one reason to live,
Except maybe the fact that if I died,
My best friend would follow,
Then I'd be a person who committed suicide and killed my best friend,
But then again it was her choice to follow me into the dark,
Right now I still don't see a reason to live,
I'm still numb,
I guess that's what can happen if you let depression take over,
You just feel numb.
