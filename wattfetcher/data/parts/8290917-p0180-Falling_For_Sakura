Sakura's tears flowed down her cheeks. "Daddy James, please, you've done nothing wrong."
James brought her hand to his lips and kissed it. "I'm so sorry, Sakura. I've failed as a father. I couldn't protect you."
Sakura shook her head. "No, you didn't fail. You're a marvelous father, and I'm your daughter." She raised up and touched her hand to his face. Slowly, she leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. "I love you, Daddy James, and thank you for everything. You will always be my Daddy James."
James looked at his adopted daughter and realized the meaning of her words. Yes, she had told them that she was leaving, but this soon?
"Good-bye, Daddy James," she said, a sad smile on her face.
James watched as she slowly rested back and then closed her eyes, tears rolling down her pale cheeks.
A hollow feeling sat in the pit of his stomach as James walked out the door, knowing very well what was going to happen next. "I love you, my daughter Sakura. You will always be our Sakura no matter who you are or where you are." Then he was gone.
Sakura quietly sobbed until she fell asleep. The next time she woke up, she saw Ned sitting beside her bed, waiting for her to wake.
"I was mighty worried, you know," was his greeting.
Sakura smiled weakly. "I'm still alive, Ned dear."
He suddenly hugged her tightly. "Don't you ever do that to me again," he muttered, tears in his eyes. "I'm too old for that sort of bullshit now."
She chuckled. Then when he moved back and looked at her, she said, "Ned dear, I need your help."
"You know I will do anything to help you," he replied, noting the determined look in her dark eyes.
"Thank you," she said, smiling.
