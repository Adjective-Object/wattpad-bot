"You remind me of my daughter, strong, determinate and smart with a great personality" He said.
"What a great honor sir"
"Go, I don't wanna see you kicked out again".
.......
I walked in math class.
"Am I late ?" I asked teacher Jason
"No, Just in time. Have a seat"
"What happened ?" Helen whispered to me.
"You're in my class? since when ?"I asked.
"I've always been here but you've never noticed" She whispered.
"Sorry, I'm too busy ignoring Jake and Damon" We both chuckled.
"Silence please, Shall we start the lesson ?" The teacher smiled
"Yes sir" We all said.
..................
The class ended smoothly, teacher Jason is really ... nice.
I walked to my locker to take some pens and I heard my phone ringing.
DAD.
keep calm Leena, keep calm ... I FREAKED OUT.
(A\N : Like I said before, Leena and her parents speak Arabic but I'm translating their conversations for those who don't understand Arabic)
"Assalamu alaykom" I said while shaking
"Wa alaykom al salam, I missed you, How is it going there? What are you doing? How's your family" He asked enthusiastically.
"Hamdullah hamdullah everything is fine"
my conscienceÂ : tell him about the families exchange. He has always trusted you don't lie to him. If he accidentally knows from the embassy or anyone he won't be very happy. Just tell him and let whatever is gonna happen happen.
"Dad"
"yes love"
"I'm sorry" I started sobbing. Because the thought of me lying to mom, the thought of losing their trust and the thought of disappointing them came to my mind.
"What? what's wrong ! is there someone annoying you ! why are you crying Leena"
"Dad, I have to go to my last class, when I go home I'll call you and explain everything to you"
I hung up leaving my dad worried and nervous.

PE. The class I officially hate because :
1- I hate running and jumping in front of boys who keep staring at me waiting for my skirt or over-over sized pants to go up a little
2- I hate watching shirtless sweaty Teenagers.
3- I hate being forced to play basketball with boys, because if I refuse, my marks will decrease.
But at least I have Hayley, Helen, Ashley, Diana and Molly.
"PASS ME THE BALL" I shouted to Molly, and she did as she was told.
But William jumped in front of my face out of no where and pushed me, I fell like a feather.
"TIME OUT" The teacher shouted and ran to me.
