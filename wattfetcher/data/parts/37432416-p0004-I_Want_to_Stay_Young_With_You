Luke POV
What the fuck have I done? I screwed up so much. So this past year, I've been really, well, torn. I finally had another friend other than Mary, but I still loved her. A lot. And she never knew. She'll never know that I still love her.
Sometime after school I saw her walking her dog. God, she always just looks so perfect all the time! This girl will be the death of me.
I called out, "Mary!"
She turned around, saw it was me, and started to run back home. My long legs help me in situations like this. I caught up with her and stopped her before she could go in the house.
"Mary! Just hear me out ok?" I pleaded.
"Hear you out Luke? What the fuck? You made a fool out of me. I hate you so much. I'm a slut anyways, right? So why are you trying to talk to me, huh?" She yelled. First of all, she called me Luke. That's not my Mary. Second of all, she needs to know that I love her.
I grabbed the nape of her neck and smashed our lips together. For a split second, she kissed back. She actually kissed back. Then she pushed me off and ran into her house, now carrying her dog.
She kissed back. But she hates me. What the hell does that even mean?I still need to tell her the truth. In words.
Mary POV
I ran into my house immediately darting upstairs. at this point I was crying, I don't even know why. Luke kissed me. He's probably on his man period. I kissed back and I, well, I enjoyed it. But I shouldn't have. I'm mad at him. At least, I should be. You see my problem here?  Oh my god, I swear this boy. I want to hate you, even though I can't help but love you.
