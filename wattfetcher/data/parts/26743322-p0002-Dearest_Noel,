❝But then I finally understood, it wasn't worth the truth❞

Dearest Noel,
How am I supposed to go on without you? How am I supposed to fake a smile, muster up a giggle when I lost you, Noel?
The one who made me feel most alive even in death, the one who made my eyes fire up like the evening sun kissing the ocean's horizon.
The one who made my laugh bounce off the walls with his irrestiable charming ways and gentle gestures.
The one I called my best-friend.
How Noel, tell me how.
Tell me Noel, how couldn't I have seen it?
Tell me why, tell me how.
How is it that I missed it?
How could I not see the pain behind your eyes, hear the emptiness in your laugh, feel the sadness in your touch?
Please make me understand how.
...I failed you Noel and I will never forgive myself for that...
