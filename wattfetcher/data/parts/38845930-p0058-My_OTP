Erin's POV
Jordan, Boo and I took a day off from everything and just hung out at a park.
"Boo!" Jordan screamed running over to her where she got hurt the last time we were here.
"Jeez, Boo, I'd think you would have learned your lesson last time this happened." He said as she reached up for him.
"Again, Boo?" I asked.
"You alright?" Jordan asked.
"Mmm hmm." She said with a pouty lip hugging Jordan and nodding yes.
"Good, now tuck that lip away and play some more... not on that thing again." He said pushing her bottom lip back where it should be making her smile.
"You would be such a great dad, Jordan." I said holding his hands and twisting one of my knees in to spin around so I was in Jordan's arms.
--I doubt you get what I mean here with the knee spin--
"Would I?" He asked.
"Of course, do you see how you are with her?" I asked.
"A dad?" He asked.
"Yes a dad... not a mom, you're a man." I said, he laughed at it.
"I guess I would, wouldn't I?" He asked.
"Yeah, you would... and you are." I said.
"I'm a dad!?" He asked.
"No! A father figure to Boo." I laughed.
"Oh thank god, I almost had a heart attack. And we haven't even... you know, so you couldn't have been pregnant anyway." He said shaking his head no the entire time.
"What, you don't want kids?" I asked.
"No, I want kids. Boo is kind of like my kid, she is my girlfriends daughter who lives with me, so." He said.
"That's true." I said.
"Mommy! Jordan! Look what I just found!" Boo said running over to us holding up a big purple flower.
"And speak of the devil, what did you find there little missy?" He asked.
"I found a big flower, can you put it in my hair?" She asked.
"Sure, no problem... now you're gonna look all pretty." He said.
"Yay! Am I pretty mommy?" She asked.
"You're always pretty to me." I said.
"Thank you, Jordan." She said running off again.
"You're definitely going to be a great dad." I said.
"I can see that now." He said.
"I love you." I said.
"I love you. Do you see what you've created? An adorable monster." He said pointing to Boo.
"I did create something adorable, huh?" I asked.
"You sure did... but I love that little monster, not as much as I love you."
"Do you know what love is?" I asked.
"What is love? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more. What is love?" He asked, I laughed really hard at that one.
"Love is when you can't stay away from someone, when you want to hold there hands and kiss 'em, love is when you fight... and by the end of it you're saying I love you... and I am in love with you." I said.
