❝ I'm the New Kid,❞
Carter Evergreen, a tough, rebellious, 17 year old girl, moves from Orlando, Florida, all the way to Seattle, Washington. When she arrives to Richardson High School, the 'popular girls' see her as a threat to their clique, especially when the school's 'it' boy forms in interest in the new girl.
❝ Well, I'm Nick ❞
Nick Robinson, an actor, the 'it' boy, Mr. Popular. He's looking for a girl who likes him, for him. Not girls like Annabelle, Stacey, and Ali; the 'popular girls' of Richardson High, who only cared about the famous movie he has recently starred in.
❝ Well, I certainly can't say I've seen you anywhere before ❞
Could Carter be the girl he's been looking for, due to the face that she only knows him for him, and not for his fame?
❝ Seeing you with him makes me sick ❞
Can Nick get the girl he wants easily, or will he have to fight to get her away from the football players' eyes?
❝ I thought you had feelings for me? I broke up with him for you ❞
Betrayal.
❝ I have to leave, babe ❞
Heartbreak.
❝ I LOVE YOU CARTER EVERGREEN ❞
Love.
