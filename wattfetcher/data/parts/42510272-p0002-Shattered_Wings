(Megans pov) My dad's and uncles had just left the bunker,leaving me and jade. Jade was sitting at the table reading 'percy jackson' while I was searching through the fridge for some alcohol. I know I'm 'under-age' but who gives a sh!t?  It's my birthday in like three days, so it's not that big of a deal."aha!" I exclaimed as I finally found a beer. Jade looked up from her book and she looked disappointed. "honestly, megan?  Isn't it a little early for beer?" "nope" I walked over to the drawer and pulled out the bottle opener. After I opened the beverage I chugged down nearly the entire contents of the bottle.jade sighed and facepalmed. "you do realise you're dad is going to murder you, right?""ah, f#ck him" I drank the rest of the beer and proceeded to get another one from the fridge. "MEGAN NOVAK-WINCHESTER! PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW!" I jumped and dropped the beer. The bottle shattered on the floor as I swung round, only to come face to face with my very angry dad. Oh sh!t."what the h3ll do you think you're doing?!""...I was getting a beer" he glared at me."room.now""but dad!""no""jade help" I looked at jade pleadingly."uncle dean...don't be so harsh.it's her birthday in a few days and-""jade stay out of this!""dean, stop yelling at them." uncle sam walked in."Sammy, she was drinking!""I know, and she shouldn't have been.but don't be so harsh.ground her if you want but remember she's an adult" dad poutted and crossed his arms over his chest."fine...Megan, you're grounded until your birthday.""but-"he looked at me."fine"
