"I will," I said and stuck my tongue out at him. "Mr. Bossypants."
"Goodnight Aust."
"Night Alan." I said before climbing into my own bunk.  I laid there and smiled to myself.
I can't believe all this happened today.


Vic's Pov


Ever since Kellin and I woke up in the field together things have been really weird between us. Mainly because of me and also because he's mad that I talked him into getting drunk with me.   He was somewhat avoiding me but at the same time he would stay around me. And the guys have been giving him a lot of shit letting me get drunk out of my head the night before we had a show but it wasn't really his fault. I pretty much forced him to let me get drunk and get him drunk too.
It was my fault and I accepted that.  I even told the guys to quit giving him shit about it all and to not tell him about the kiss.  If they did who knows what would happen.
It didn't matter though, no one is going to say anything and it definitely won't be happening again.  It was a one time thing and that was how it was going to stay. Mainly because I don't like Kellin like that, he's just the merch manager and somewhat of a friend. Nothing more no matter how much the guys want it to happen.
It wasn't going to happen.
"Hey Vic do you know how long it's going to be before our next stop?" Tony asked. "Cause I need to pee and Jaime made the bathroom stink again."
"A about three hours." I said, "So you might have to suck it up and go."
"But it smells!" He whined.
"Wait- that's why it smells in there?" Mike asked pausing his video game.
"Yeah, its gross."
"Just open a few windows, it'll be gone eventually."
"Well why don't you go in there and open the window because I sure as hell am not going to." Tony said.
"I don't have to pee, so you can do it if you have to go that bad."
"Vic! If you love me you'll do it!"
"Well I don't love you."
"You're an asshole and I'm going to push you off of the stage tonight." He said glaring at me.
"Well if I die then you guys have to stop touring."
"No we don't, we can just get a new singer."
"No, you can't replace me. No one is like me."
"Whatever helps you sleep at night but if you die we'll just have Jaime sing." Mike said,
"You'd replace me that easy!" I said slightly offended.
"Yes."
"I'm hurt." I said putting a hand to my chest, "That just hurts me."
"Good."
"Now I'm definitely not going to open the window for you." I said and Tony rolled his eyes.
"Oh shut up and go make out with Kellin."
"It was one time! And it's not happening again!"
"Still just make out with Kellin." Mike told me.
