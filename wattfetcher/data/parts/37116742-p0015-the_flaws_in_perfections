the tall grass tickling my ears as i lay flat in a meadow of dandelions.

this is where i need to be

the crowded hallways and tolling equations.

that is not where i belong

the bleak car rides to somewhere i dread.

there is not where i should waste my youth

the green field lined with white paint.

that is where i wish to stay

happiness

is what i want to become
