Me: Ok, let's just drop the conversation and we can Skype later, how does that sound?
Mom: Ok I'll see you guys later, love you both. Bye
Me: Bye
I ended the video call and closed her laptop. She sighed and I gave her a hug. "I'm sorry Baby Girl, I thought she knew. If I knew that you didn't want her to find out I wouldn't have told her" I said. "Its ok, she was gonna find out sooner or later" she answered. "So, why did you decide to Skype her all of a sudden?" I questioned. "Because I keep my distance from my family. I don't like being around them, especially when my brother is around"
"Why, what happens when your brother is around?" "All they do is rub it in my face that he's got a mansion and a lot of money and how he's so smart. They always put me down and make me feel stupid and dumb. But its just my mom and brother. I'm really close to Daddy and he's not my biological dad." "Wow Baby. Well guess what? You're not stupid or dumb. You're the smartest girl I've ever met."
"Thanks but my mom and bother font seem to think that." "Shame on them, they can think whatever they want cause what they believe is a lie. As long I know the truth that's all that matters." "Awe thanks Babe".
Amanda's P.O.V.
I haven't smiled in a week and I'm shocked that my mom made me smile a little bit when we Skyped for the first 5 minutes. Austin hasn't seen me smile and hasn't heard me laugh. I'm surprised that he hasn't said anything to me about it. I really don't want to smile or laugh since I'm  keeping a huge secret from Austin.
Austin's P.O.V.
I haven't seen Amanda smile or even heard her laugh for a week. I need to know a way to get her to smile. So I decided to ask her for her Mom's number. She gave it to me and I texted her.
*Texts*
Me: Hi this is Austin, Amanda gave me your number.
Mom: Hi Austin
Me: Listen I need your help with something....
Mom: Ok, what is it?
Me: I haven't seen Amanda smile and I haven't heard her laugh for a week,  what should I do?
