When we got to the kitchen I saw Jason Todd sitting at the table playing solitaire with deck of old cards.
"Hey Jase look who came to visit." Smiled Dick
Jason looked up from his game and saw me but made a face, "Whose she?"
"Let me handle this." I said clearing my voice, "Hey Kid how you turn on the TV." I said in my best Jason impression
"Gin? Wow how when you look good."
"Another invention that went wrong, few minutes ago, and thanks I had a make over."
"So how Natie boy doing, gosh you look like a...."
"A 16 year old yep, and he's fine."
"Are you 2 going steady?"
"Nope remember Paige?"
"You mean the girl who made Damian pass out yeah why?"
"Well he and her are dating I'm still single."
"Oh I always thought you two would tie the knot."
"Nah, oh and someone else came with me too."
Pepper ran in and jumped on Jason. Jase fell back and Pep started to lick him.
"Hey hey get off. Pepper came along too?"
"By accident yes."
Jason pushed her off and managed to get himself up.
"Hey Gin tell us what happened in your World the past two years." Said Dick
"A lot things." I smirked
