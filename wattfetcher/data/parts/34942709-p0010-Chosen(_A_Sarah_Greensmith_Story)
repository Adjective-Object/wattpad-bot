The rest of the day, me and Logan hung out. We sat in my dorm, watching movies with the gang and ate popcorn. At dinner we talked and laughed, having a good time. I didn't know what was to come, so I really didn't think of much. As I got ready for bed, I heard people screaming down the hallway. I went to the door and opened it,knowing I shouldn't of. I grabbed Ren, and hid Pip to keep him safe. Then, I ran down the hall toward the screaming. The door was wide open, and men dressed in black cloaks had stabbed two girls. I ran from room to room yelling at girls to get their weapons and leave. Most of them did, except Kait, Page,and Codie, they stayed with me as the cloaked men came down the hall toward us."You rowdy to get your butt kicked." Kait yelled at them. And they said nothing,still coming.I raised Ren, and ran forward with Page on one side, Kait on the other, and Codie behind me. I really wasn't successful, because pain struck my shoulder. I froze,gasping because the pain was so powerful. I heard Kait yell,Page screamed, and Codie caught me, lying me down on the ground. I watched Page and Kait fight the cloaked men, but they got away.I took in air, but it seemed so hard to take in."Hey you guys, I'm "holy", " I said, chuckling which made blood rise up in my throat.Kait was crying,which was a sight I had never seen."That's what you come up with." She said through tears, and sobs.I smiled," yeah, what else, I have a hole." "You're crazy." Kait said.My eyes were feeling heavy," just remember I love you guys, and tell Logan he's part of the group now, especially mine." Everything went dark, and I knew if this was the end, I had gone out trying to protect the people here.
