~A/N- I made this when I was really young, so it might not make much sense.  I haven't edited it and I'm not planning to, so might have a few mistakes.~
Wait at the horizon, where the sun and the green pastures meet
Where the stars are seen in the sky and disappear behind black sleet
Where the fields of weed blow through the air, and are trampled into the red mud without a care
Where the bugs they fly, the animals they roam
And into the sea all of the big and small creatures go
Where the authority marches and rebellion fleets
Wait at the horizon until we actually meet
Wait at the horizon, where the crease is crisp and clean
Where staring off at the edge of the earth, all fallen but the idea was to lean
Where the clouds overturn and become invicable
Whet everything goes underground and comes out invincible
Where the snow isn't white, nor the ice a cloudly clear
Where everything could be so far away, yet in arms reach, could be so near
Where flames jump out with the feeling of burning heat
Wait at the horizon until we can finally meet
Wait at the horizon, where you can see the ends of every street
Where the armies are helpless, yet the civilians ate elite
Where the children giggle, and the adults areally never at peace
Please don't leave the horizon, I want us to actually meet
