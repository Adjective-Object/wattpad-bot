Well hi, how are you? My name is Suicide
I'm the one that makes you stay up at night and cry
I'm the reason you want to put that razor through your wrist
I'm the outcome you get when you're done and want to quit
I'm what happens when it's too hard to believe
That anyone could love you, so you crawl back to me
My name is Suicide and I'll help you succeed but still loose
When the wind picks up, you're still swinging on your noose
