Albus Severus Potter watched his father continue to wave him goodbye, but soon could not see him anymore. He turned to the people in his compartment.
Rose Weasley sat opposite to him with two friends, a blonde named Deriana Girdy, and a brunette named Missy Zindrakez. His brother, James Sirius who was sitting next to him, suddenly got up.
"Where are you going?" Albus demanded. "Going to be with my friends. I said I would stay with you in your compartment, but I didn't say how long." James said, leaving Albus with the three girls.
"I'll be back." Deriana said, quickly following James. "She's obsessed with him." Missy said quietly. "Why, my brothers a complete air head." Albus said. "So your Albus Potter?" Missy asked, ignoring his comment.
"Al," Albus said quickly, "just call me Al." Albus shook Missy's hand, when someone knocked on their door. It opened to a first year, with blonde hair combed back, looking slightly dazed.
"Hello. Who are you?" Al said. The boy muttered something, and sat down after closing the door, and he stared at his hands. "Sorry, I didn't hear you." Al said. "Scorpius. Scorpius Malfoy." He said nervously.
Rose gasped and crossed her arms. "I don't like you, just so you know." She stated. "Rose! Goodness, do you have a heart!" Al said. She skrinked into her seat under Al's glare.
"Thanks." Scorpius muttered. "It's nothing. Why did you come to our compartment?" Al asked. "No one wanted me to sit with them." Scorpius said. "That's okay, we're fine with you sitting here." Al said.
"Who are you?" Scorpius asked. "Al. Al Potter." Al said. "So your Albus Potter!" Scorpius said. "No." Al said sharply.
"I mean... No, just... Just Al, if you will." Al said. "Okay. And who are you?" Scorpius asked Missy. She looked up, her eyes wide with surprise that she would be spoken to by... Well, any Malfoy.
"Missy. Zindrakez." Missy said, and every time she spoke, her voice was soft, and very quiet. "Well hello." Scorpius smiled. "Ow!" He said, holding his head.
"You alright?" Al asked. Scorpius nodded, waving it off as nothing. "Just... Just a headache." He said unconvincingly. "Okay." Al said anyways.
If he doesn't want to talk about it, I won't force him to.
"I have to go a minute, but I'll be right back, okay?" Scorpius asked. "Okay." Al said. "I think he just doesn't want to sit with us anymore." Rose said. "Don't say that! You never know, maybe he will come back." Al said.
They waited and waited, and finally, Al stood up, grabbing the invisibility cloak his dad had given him, and throwing it over himself. Rose didn't notice his absence because she was busy reading, and so was Missy.
He stood in the hallway, and decided to go to the back of the train. Not all the way back, but just to search for Scorpius. He looked in every compartment, then he found the one with Scorpius in it.
Someone went into it, so Al followed behind them. There were two boys in there, and both had their wands pointing at Scorpius, who was in front of a girl that looked exactly like him.
Scorpius also had his wand out, pointing to the boys. "Don't you come near her!" Scorpius spat at them. "Or what! Gonna jinx us wittle bitty Malfoy?" The first teased.
"If I need to, I will." Scorpius said. "Ooh! We're scared now!" The second said. "You need to be taught a lesson little Malfoy. Don't mess in other people's business. Cru-"
