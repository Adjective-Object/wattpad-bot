(This will be a little different former dream. The dream wasn't really specific. The picture of the elf at the top is Michelle when she becomes a full elf.)
"Get together." Gandalf ordered.
"Thieves. Bandits. Massacre." A voice said.
I joined Gandalf in greeting the brown wizard. "Hi. You must be Radagast the brown. I am Michelle, seer of Thorin's company. I admire your way of life. I must get back to the group." I sighed then joined Thorin. I watched as Radagast whispered to Gandalf. He pointed to me several times. I arched an eyebrow.
You don't need to worry. I will tell you later. Gandalf thought to me.
Is it bad? I asked.
No. It's not entirely good either.
Ok. You better tell me in Rivendell.
I will. There is no need to worry, Michelle.
A howling sound surrounded us. "Wargs!" I shouted. A warg jumped out of nowhere. Thorin killed it before it could hurt me. A second jumped at us. Kili and I shot it a couple of times and killed it. We took our arrows.
"Who did you both tell about this quest other then Thorin's kin?" Gandalf questioned me and Thorin.
"No one." Thorin replied.
"Who did you both tell?" Gandalf repeated.
"No one. What in Durin's name is going on?" Thorin asked.
"You both are being hunted."
"Why am I being hunted?" I growled.
"I will explain later. We must go." Gandalf stated.
"I can be a diversion." Radagast offered.
The two wizards argued. Radagast rode off. Gandalf led the way out of the woods and through the country side. We continued to run. A warg caught our scent. Kili and I killed the warg while Fili killed the orc. The other wargs found us. We ran again. Gandalf stopped at a boulder. I recognized it to be the entrance of the hidden passage. Gandalf went through the passage.
Wargs surrounded us. One leaped at Thorin. I pushed him out of the way and took the hit. The warg clawed at my stomach and bit into my side. Thorin appeared out of nowhere and killed the warg. He took me to the passage. I realized that my necklace was missing. Thorin and I slid down the entrance. A horn filled the air. Elrond. I smiled. A dead orc fell through the hole.
"Elves." Thorin spat.
"Michelle is badly injured." Gandalf stated.
"We will get you aid soon." Thorin promised as he lifted me into his arms.
I smiled weakly. The company moved on. We came into view of Rivendell. Haley and Kili held hands. Every now and then everyone would check on me. We made our way to Rivendell. An elf walked down some stairs. Gandalf and the elf talked. An elven horn blew in the wind. Elves on horses. An elf on a pitch black horse rode up to us with my necklace. I had Thorin set me down. I walked up to the main elf with Thorin at my side to help me keep my balance.
"That is my necklace. I lost it when a warg attacked me. Thank you for retrieving it for me. May I please have it?" I asked kindly.
