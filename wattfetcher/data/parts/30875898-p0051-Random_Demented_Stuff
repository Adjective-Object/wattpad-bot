This one is for the girl I know
Hair of raven, eyes of dough
This one is for the girl I know
Lips of cherry, skin of snow
This one is for the girl I know
Soft as a feather, with a heavenly glow
This one is for the girl I know
Her smile so big she steals the whole show
This one is for the girl I know
She drops jaws everywhere she goes
This one is for the girl I know
Everyone sits there and treats her like a popular Jane Doe
This one is for the girl I know
She doesn't know it, but she was beautiful from head to toe
