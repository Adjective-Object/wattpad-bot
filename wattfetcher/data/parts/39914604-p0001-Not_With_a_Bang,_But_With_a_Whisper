Dear anyone who will listen,
I have decided to make the not-so-tragic decision of ending my life. Wow, pat on the back for me! Everyone wants to end with a 'BANG', like the finale at a fireworks show, but not me. I want to end with a whisper, to end with everyone knowing who I am, but not dating to utter a word about me. So here lies my journal, in the hands of whoever picked it up out of the grass. You lucky duck! If you want to read, please do, if not, pass it on. I want everyone to remember me as I was, not as I am.
Sincerely,
Frank Iero
