But this diary is welcoming you to read cause yes this is private and ta but I want people to know what I did with my crush in case u want info. ❤️😄 ok so a little about what this is..... This is my love life written in words on this screen. I wrote this with my time so please don't put any mean comments. 😄 only happy or good. If you need any advice, ask me if u want. I might not have the right info u need cause we r two different people but I'll tell u what I did.
A little about me: I'm 12 years old almost 13 and just finished 6th grade so I'm going to 7th. 😄 my favorite color is purple. I LOVE chimpanzees!!! I donated money to them by buying dark chocolate lol😂 my name is Danielle, it's not Lucy.
Why is my username cutiepie_lucy??Well, so I had this dog and she was so so so perfect!!! So was a brown lab and she was so floppy and adorable!! I swear it feels like she was an angel dog from heaven! So, one day she ran away but came back cause she knows where home was. The next day she ran away too and I wasn't that worried cause I knew she would come home. But she didn't and I waited for days, then days turned into months! A friend of mine said that she was playing outside and saw a brown lab out side and it got ran over. 😭 well I heard that i was so sad!!! I cried so much! I still miss her a lot but it's been about a year since she died and I don't really cry as much. Some times late at night i stare at my ceiling and think about her then start to tear up. Her birthday was jan. 26. I really really miss her so much!! If I could go back in time I would love to see her and pet her even for one second! She was my best friend! I told her EVERYTHING! My family was going through tough times and it was really sad so I would just go out and talk to her and lay down with her and she would wrap her arms around me. The picture for this chapter is her. 😔
Sorry for that sad moment. 😌 anyways..... I HOPE YOU ENJOY MY DIARY!!! 😜😝😈😊☺️😎😍😉😀😂😄😃😛😹😸😺😻👧🏽👧🏽
