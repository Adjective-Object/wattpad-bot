*Zachs POV*

We put in a movie and this is a perfect movie because I know that Morgan will get scared.  a scary part came up and Morgan jumped. So I went to go sit beside and I cuddled with her so she would know that its all right...I think she might be the one for me.

*Morgans POV*

So a scary part came up and I jumped. Zach saw that I was scared and he came to cuddle with me. When he started to cuddle with me I felt something that ive never felt before. I got butterflies in my stomach and I was thinking that maybe me and Zach wouldn't be so bad. But what about Corisha. Maybe tomorrow I will talk to her about Zach and other stuff. About an hour later the movie ended and it was like 11:06 pm. So I asked Zach if I could stay the night. "Hey Zach, can I stay the night?" "sure and btw my parents aren't home all this weekend so you can stay with me the whole time" he said. "Ok sounds fun" I said back. So now me and Zach head upstairs and go into his room. "Here you can get the bed and I will sleep on the floor" Zach said, "no this is your bed you sleep there and I will sleep on the floor" I said to him "how bout we both sleep on the bed" he said "ok that's fine" I said back to him. So he got under the covers and so did I. He started to wrap his arm over me and I felt his warm body touch mine. I knew that I was falling in love. And I think he was too.
