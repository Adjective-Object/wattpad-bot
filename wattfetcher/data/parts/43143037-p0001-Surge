"Devon, Tiffany is here."my mom yells, I run downstairs and look at Tiffany "Ready."she says I nod, me and Tiffany have been friends for years. Today we are going camping with her mom and dad, I look at my mom and hug her "Your dad had to be at work but he wants you to be careful."she says as I pull apart she kisses my cheek, and I grab my bag and walk out.
We get in my car and I drive down to the campsite. We get out and walk over to the camper, we walk in and I look at her mom she smiles "Glad you could make it."she says "Mom me and her are gonna walk around we'll be back before dinner."Tiff says she nods and we walk to the woods we walk around. "This place is kinda creepy."she says I look at her when something tackles me and bites my wrist they get up and run I look at my bloody wrist "What. Dev."Tiff screams I get up and she looks at me when a man about in his thirties runs over "I'm Malcolm and I think my friend has bitten you."he says "Something did."I say he walks over and looks at my wrist "Oh boy I'm sorry to say but your gonna be one."he whispers I look at him and he wraps my wrist in a white bandage I look at him he has hazel eyes and dark skin "Okay I need to find Jax do you know where he went."he says "He went that way he ran."I say he sighs "Jax."he yells and a boy merges from the trees he looks at me "Did you do this."Malcolm says he looks at him "Yes."he says Malcolm looks at me "Don't tell a soul about this."he says I nod and Jax looks at me Tiff looks at me with fear.
I grab her hand and pull her back to the camper, I take my jacket and slide it on, when she pulls me outside and into the woods "Your eyes are golden what the heck your teeth are sharp."she says I freeze "Well, well, well look what we have here a new one."a boy says coming over to us I look at him "W-Who are you."Tiff stutters "I'm a camreson I kill werewolf's."he says I swallow, he walks up to me and holds my neck with his hand I look at him "Get away from her."a boy says he smiles, and clutches my neck tighter stopping my air way "Get away from her."the boy says I look at him Jax why is he here "A camreson won't stop till they're all dead."the boy says, I grab his hand and pull him to a tree he hits his head and Tiff looks at me the boy gets up, and Jax pulls me to his side his hand firmly on my waist "Stay away."Jax says he walks over and looks at me "She's new and yet doesn't know."he says I look at him Jax pushes me behind him and he flips the boy I freeze when someone grabs me, I kick and fight but it doesn't help they pull me back, and I stop fighting "Its fine my name is Kiefer and I'm with Jax come on."he whisper I turn and he pulls me down the trail in the woods.
We make it to a road "I can't leave."I say he looks at me "You have to, Derek will only keep trying to kill you and so will the others."he says I look at him when a jeep stops in front of us the window rolls down and I see Malcolm "Get in."he says I shake my head "I can't leave and I won't."I say he looks at me, I walk back into the woods and look around I walk down the trail and hear someone walking, I stop and look around great I'm lost, when Jax merges from the trees, I look at him and walk past him "Devon where are you going."he says I look at him "To find Tiff."I say and I start walking he runs up to me when thunder cracks "You can't be in here alone."he says I look at him and walk to the front "Dev."Tiff screams hugging me I her "Come on get inside girls."her mom yells over thunder I look back and see Jax his eyes are golden "Come on."Tiff says.
We get inside the camper, and we walk to our room we sit on the bed "Jax was pretty cute."Tiff says I look at her when someone knocks on the window making her jump I look and see Jax soaked I open the window and look at him "Why."I say he looks at me, and I realize his stomach is bleeding when the Camreson runs out I help him in and I shut the window along with the blinds, I lay him on the floor he looks at me and his breathing gets heavy Tiff looks at me "Okay um I don't what to do, Dev."Tiff says I shrug "Guys just hold on."Jax whispers I look at him he looks at me and sits up, I look at him he lifts his shirt to a shorter cut then what he had "How did is happen."I say he looks at me "Trying to keep you alive."he says I look at Tiff she hands me my phone and I get on Google.
