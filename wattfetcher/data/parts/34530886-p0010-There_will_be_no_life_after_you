"Oh okay..." I said as I finished my last chip. I wiped the crumbs off of my hands on my pants. He walked closer to me and looked into my eyes, I felt safe and secure. Normally people say that the eyes are the window into the soul or something like that... when I looked into his I saw my future.
After that it was silence for a few moments until he pulled me closer and kissed me. I wrapped my arms around him as I kissed him back his lips tasted like salt and vinegar like the chips we just ate. As the kiss grew more intense, I sat on the piano bench and pulled him closer to me. Just then I realized that this was wrong even if we were going to be something, this is way too fast. I pulled away slowly. I was breathless, our breath mixed as we stared into each others eyes. He bit his lip and smirked and I giggled lightly as I kissed him on the lips again slowly savoring the taste and the feeling of his lips on mine.
"That was hot." Said a female voice from the doorway he quickly pulled away to look at Esther. "Don't worry mom got called into work so its just us three. But I'm planning to go to Oliver's house sooooo the house is yours."
"Okay cool." Hayden said casually I was still breathless from the kiss and I just nodded. Esther exited the house. Hayden and I sat in silence for about fifteen minutes until we kissed again.
