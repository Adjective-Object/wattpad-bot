This past weeks insults and shoving ran through my brain. It was all not new but I hurt a lot inside. I wasn't bullied only by Sally and her posse. I was just invisible.
The girl who had her headphones in all the time. The girl who never talked. The nobody. The nothing. I took another sip. The drink intoxicating my brain. All these thoughts clearing up. All these thoughts pushes away for now.
