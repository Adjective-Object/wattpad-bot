"I'm just sick and tired of all the bs between you and Mark, mom. Im gonna move In with dad" i say trying not to tear up bcuz of how bad my life is"Serina, I know all about the shit that's happened in the past but-" I cut her off"But what mom, what if mark was drinking and then he came home and took it out on me INSTEAD of you? Huh? Im gonna call my dad and tell him I'm staying with him for a bit."
**phone call**
Dad- Helllooo???
Me-hey dad, can I stay at your house for a bit?
Dad- of course daughter, when?
Me- uhmmm... Today?
Dad- ok, start packing and I'll come and get you.
Me- k bye daddy
**end of phone call**
I start packing and mom just ignores the fact that I'm really leaving and its not a joke.
Dad comes an hour later and I have 3 suitcases for all of my clothes, shoes, electronics, and my makeup bag is in the electronic suitcase or whatever .I'm literally leaving the house I've lived in my whole life, I just hope theyre are cute boys around where I live. And good thing that school is already out so I don't have to worry bout that.
