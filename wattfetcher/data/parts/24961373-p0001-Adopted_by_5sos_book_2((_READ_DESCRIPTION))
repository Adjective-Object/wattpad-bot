*Luke's POV*
Why would Calum be so mean? Claire didn't mean to do that. It's not her fault that he scared the sh*t out of her.
"Calum why did you do that?! She's probably scared to death. She didn't mean to!!" Ashton said, echoing my thoughts.
"I-I don't even know. Oh my gosh I'm so mean. Oh I have to go apologize!!" Calum said, and he dashed down the stairs, us following.
*Claire's POV*
I shivered and curled into a tighter ball. I was terrified. Why did I ever believe them? I was startled when I heard a door come open and loud footsteps coming from the stairs. I stood up and looked through the rusty bars of the cage. Oh No.
Calum ran towards the cage and I backed up and slid into the corner, my tail tucked around my waist and my ears completely flat. I trembled as Calum unlocked the cage and walked towards me. I cowered away from his touch and saw the other boys walking over. I screamed as Calum picked me up and thrashed around in his arms. He brought me upstairs and set me down on the couch. I was crying hysterically and gasping for breath.
"I'm sorry Claire please I'm sorry!!! I shouldn't have hit you I'm so sorry. I know that you probably are terrified and I hate myself so much for hitting you. I'm an idiot and I'm sorry." Calum pleaded. To say that I was scared was an understatement. I was petrified. I know that you are probably thinking 'Wow she's so dumb Calum is so sweet and sincere she should forgive him', but if you were in my shoes, you would feel the same way. I darted off the couch and ran into the kitchen, and I wedged myself in a cabinet in the pantry. My ears flicking around and I heard footsteps and the boys calling my name. I was not coming out.
