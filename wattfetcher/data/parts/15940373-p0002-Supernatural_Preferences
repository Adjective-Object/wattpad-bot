Lucifer- You were walking friend's dog. You took off the lead and let him run off in the park you sat down on the bench. You were doing a friend a favour by walking the dog. You suddenly heard the dog barking. You turn around and see the dog biting the pants leg of a man. You rushed towards the man. And pulled the dog away and attached the lead. You look up at the man. "Sorry. My friend's dog doesn't know how to not bite people." You said as he chuckled. "No worry. My name is Lucifer." You smiled. "Funny thing, the dogs name is Lucifer. I know now why." You laughed as it was a joke, he started to laugh. "My name is (y/n) by the way. I have to go before my friend thinks I ran off with this dog, and I really hate this dog." He smiled as he waved you goodbye.
Michael- You were at the park with your group of friends.You were playing American Football with your male best friend. He threw the ball miles away and you didn't catch it. You sighed and ran towards the direction of the ball. You went into the trees and couldn't find it. You sighed but carried on finding. "Excuse me?" You turned around and saw a handsome man. "Are you trying to find this?" You saw him with the football in his hand. You nodded. "Thank you..uh." You wanted to know him more. So you wanted his name. "Michael." You smiled. "Thank you Michael. I'm (y/n)." As you took the ball out of his hands. "See you around Michael." As you waved goodbye and ran towards your friends.
Crowley- You walking and it was dark until this man appeared in front of you. "Can I help you?" You asked. You were already in a pissed off mood. "Yes, give me your soul." You stared at the man. "You fucking weirdo." You hissed as you pushed pass him. You carried on walking until he appeared in front of you again. "I am Crowley, now give me your soul. There is no need to be rude." You rolled your eyes. "And I am (y/n). No I will not give you my soul. Now piss the fuck off." As you walked away to you apartment.
