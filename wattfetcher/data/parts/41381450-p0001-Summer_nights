{flashback}
*8 year old Astrea sits on the stares outside of her house playing her video games on her new Nintendo DS*
"Astrea.." A voice says softly from around the corner.
Astrea quickly looks up and is greeted by a women dressed in a suit. She looked as if she had not one single flaw, as if someone had spent the time to straiten every single hair on her head to make sure not one hair was out of place.
Astrea is very confused she looks up and the women has a look in her eyes as if she is sorry for her.
"My parents arnt here.." She begins, but the lady stops her.
"I know... Astrea there are men here to take you to county jail to see your parents. They have been arrested."
Astrea barley understood but she went with them, the lady was in the back seat with her, she could tell they sent her to comfort her because she was the only one who didn't look as scary.
" what are they in for? " Astrea questions.
"They have been doing business with some bad people, my name is heather cooper, by the way."
Astrea didn't know then but Heather meant that her parents where drug dealers.
"Thank you Ms.Cooper... For not lying to me."
The lady shows her perfectly straight teeth and bares a smile for just a moment "please, you can call me heather"
They arrive at the jail about an 15 minuets later.
As much as you would think Astrea would be shocked she wasn't, in fact it surprised heather of how calm she was.
It took a while but Astrea finally got to see her mom.
Astrea stood there staring at her through the glass that they had that separated her and her mom.
Her mom ran up to the glass almost scaring Astrea.
"Whatever they tell you don't listen to them! It's all your fathers fault! I got mixed up in it!" Her mother began to bang on the glass and the gaurd had to take her back in.
Astrea stood there for a while, not being able to get one word out. Her mouth just open.
"Come on we better go" heather says.
"Where is my father?" Astrea asked.
"I don't know but he's not here, we should go now."
"Where? Where are you taking me?"
"You can't stay in your house, you will live with me, the reason they sent me is because I'm a foster parent. You'll live with me now..
Let's go."
