It's been 2 weeks since TC and MG found out Adam was in a coma. No one still doesn't know what happened to him. One day while they were sitting in Adam's room something happens. His heart monitor started beeping fast. Doctors rushed in while nurses rushed everyone out. Alex fought back but Seto and Ty forced her out. She just cried on her soon to be husband's chest. At that point everyone was sad and crying worried for their friend.
