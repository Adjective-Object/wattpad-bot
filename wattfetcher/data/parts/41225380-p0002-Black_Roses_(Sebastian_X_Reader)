I walk along the cold London streets shivering as the moon illuminates my (S/T) skin.
I wrap my arms around my torso as I tried to stay warm.
My (E/C) eyes wander towards a bench on the side of the street. I sat down and remembered today's earlier events.
-Flashback------------------------
"YOU WORTHLESS TART!"
Stinging pain spread against my cheek as my master beat me.
I was one of his many maids that he abused often. I had made a huge mistake of spilling wine on him. Now, the consequences were deadly.
He grabbed my (H/C) hair and threw me to the ground. I whimper in pain as he kicks me in the stomach.
"GET OUT OF MY DAMN MANOR!" He yelled furiously. I struggled to get to my feet and dashed out of the horrid place.
I dashed out to the streets and fell to my knees.
"What now...?" I mumbled to myself.
I had realized that I had no where to go at this point. I didn't have any family left... and that manor was my home.
-End-Of-Flaskback-------------
The streets were empty and silent. It was peaceful in a way. Besides the fact that I was freezing.
My eyes were struggling to stay open. I gave in and decided to lie down on the bench. At some point, I fell asleep.
- Time-Passes--------------------
I woke up to the loud noises of the city. It was still a little cold outside. I shivered a bit.
I must look like a mess, people walking by are giving me nasty looks.
I guess I looked homeless.
The funny thing about that was,
I was.
-----------------------------------------Hi! Thank you so much for reading this chapter!
I know, I know, so far it had almost nothing to do with the Phantomhive manor.
But worry not! The next chapter will have that!
I apologize for this chapter being as short as Levi Ackerman! x3
Thanks again!
