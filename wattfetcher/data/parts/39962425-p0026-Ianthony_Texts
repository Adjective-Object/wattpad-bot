A: Ian? I think we should move somewhere else.
I: Why? Everyone we know and love is here in L.A...
A: In L.A.
I: Now is not the time to joke about that.
A: Sorry. Couldn't resist.
I: Now, why the hell do you want to move?
A: idk.... it's just that we have lived in California for so long... I guess I just want to see some change in my surroundings. I'm tired of hot and rain. Hell, it never snows here! I first saw snow in New York a couple years ago, and it was the best time of my life.
I: What about Smosh Games?
A: We're hardly on the channel anymore, anyway. It wouldn't make much of a difference.
I: But what about Josh, Mari, Matt, David, Wes, and Flitz?
A: We can still come visit them! Or they can visit us! Either way, we'll still keep in touch!
I: But what do we tell our fans?
A: We don't.
I: Excuse me?
A: We don't tell them.
I: But..... The Smosh Is Bored's!
A: They'll just assume we're at your house or something.
I: But, Ant, I don't want to lie to them or keep this from them. They don't even know we're engaged!
A: Some things are better kept secret, you know that. I would tell them everything, but not all people are very nice.
I: I know, I know....
A: Please, just let us keep this in the dark?
I: Okay. Where would we even move, anyway?
A: A place that snows.
I: So basically any place but California?
A: Yes.
I: So New York then?
A: Yes.
I: Alrighty then!
