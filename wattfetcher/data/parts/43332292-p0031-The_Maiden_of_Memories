"Then how are we going to catch him? Heck, we're just petty humans – well, technically Lethe's a mermaid but that's not much better – and you know that the royalty don't listen to peasants. How can we even get a chance to meet up with him? It's not like we can get into the Ancient Mountain itself. Security is pretty tight there."
"I have my ways," was all Theo said. "I know how we can get up the mountain, and I know Morpheus. He's not a big fan of me, but he doesn't really care much either. He'd be willing to spend a few minutes talking about some treasure he created."
"So we just go to the Ancient Mountain right now?"
Theo shook his head. "No. That's a bit of a trouble to get into, even with my secrets. Besides, your thief is here, isn't he? We should find your thief and confirm whether he's here or he left already. We need to stay here for a bit more, just to make sure that the thief is still within our sights."

"No. What we do now is eat, because I'm pretty sure we're all starving right now. Let's go find food."
