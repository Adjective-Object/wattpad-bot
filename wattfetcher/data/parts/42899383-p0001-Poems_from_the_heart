My heart and soul are frozen.The fear keeps me back, unable to escape my cage of dought. But when I break the bars I have choices, to stay, to leave. I think unclearly about my choice. No one to save my fall No one to entertain my rot.When I face my fears I find the difficult truth of my guilty past.
