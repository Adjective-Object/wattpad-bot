1. My teacher is a huge FUCKING ASSHOLE
2. He never really helps us
3. He thinks that we should be able to play like Fucking 11th and 12th graders and just to Tell you those 11th and 12th graders have been playing for years and years people years I say
4. I am Fucking stressed all the Time because of him ( I had him today *sighs* why me)
5. I Call him mister asshole because he us one ( but only when he can't hear)
6. He forced us to play  instruments  ( we could have sang if we wanted to)
