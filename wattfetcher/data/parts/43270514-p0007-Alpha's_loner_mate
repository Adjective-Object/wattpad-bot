"Let's dance" I smirked.
He lunged at me. I moved and took my headphones off in one swift movement. I held a rock in one hand. My handy dandy knife in my pocket.
I pulled it out as we circled each other. He growled and its lip curled up flashing it sharp teeth. I held my knife firm and it lunged again. I moved to the side getting a good cut in its body.
That made it even more angrier. It came after me. He wants to play. I turned on one heel and ran. I was a good runner. I did it all the time. The heavy paws pounded as it chases after me.
I turned on a tree and got cornered. It snarled and came closer slowly. I held my knife and lunged at it. It was a intense battle. All my moves I learned came in handy.
My dad also taught me a few things before he died. I felt a sharp pain in my leg and saw blood. I drove the knife trough its belly. It howled in pain. Then some men with guns came running in.
I rolled my eyes. A little late don't ya think.
"Your leg, come we will get you medical help" one man said.
He tried to grab my arm but I pulled away.
"Don't touch me" I snarled.
He looked confused. I limped away.
"Your in need of medical attention" he yelled.
I kept walking. It was quiet some time before I got to the place where I had left my stuff. But it was gone. The gate had been opened. There was some track marks where the gate had been dragged opened and closed.
I rose a eyebrow. I didn't want to jump up because my leg. My body from Franks beating was catching up to me. I grasped the fence and my legs pulled up weak. I struggled to keep my eyes open. I regret not taking that medical attention.
I slid to the ground and my eyes fluttered close. I saw the men with guns run to my side. They started to say things but all I saw was their mouths moving. My body was picked up with a heavenly sent.
I closed my eyes and I fell unconscious.
