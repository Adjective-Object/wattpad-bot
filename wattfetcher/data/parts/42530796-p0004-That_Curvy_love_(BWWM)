Why oh is this happening to me I thought to myself ,no one has ever wanted me or liked me why is this happening this it just so wrong on so many levels while thinking this something hits me oh shit I need to get ready for the day I make my way to the shower washing up faster than usual like I'm in a rush to go somewhere like where I'm I going to go.I step out the show and wrap myself up in a towel and dry myself then take my towel off and just stare at myself in the mirror I am so big I have big hips ,big breast ,and a phat ass but I don't know why am complaining about that I actual like my ass.Deciding that I want to be free today I walk down stairs butt ass naked without a care in the world.I round the corner and see that man again I total forget that I'm naked he turns a ring and he drops a an egg how the hell did he get an egg Then his eyebrows shot up and a smirk grows on his face and looks me up and down and he freezes with his eyes still on me I look down and then realize that I'm naked Not knowing what to do I use my hands and cover my lady parts up "I..I..I..I'm sooo sorry I didn't know you were in here , wait wait why the hell are you in my house"He clears his throat "I scared you early and when u ran off the door broke from you slamming it so I took matters into my own hands and Came in made my self at house and was about to make you breakfast but um you came downstairs like this but it's not like its and ugly site to see"he wiggled his eyebrows and I rolled my eyes then took off racing to my roomGot dresses and came downstairs prepared for the worst I looked around but couldn't find him he must have left I went over to the Stove and seen two omletes and pancakes set out They do actual look good I'm just going to take a little piece I start to pick at it with my fingers and strong hands stop me I turned around and saw him "What are you doing" he smiles a smile that makes me melt"I was just going t...to taste it""Then allow me to help you in that case"he takes his fingers and pick off a piece of the omelet and  his hands starts moving turns my mouth "What are you doing you don't even know me I don't even know you"" Evan Clark  I'm 25 and I know you very well from having some friends help me find you , but I also want to get to know you off paper" I was speech less"Do you still want to taste it" I nod my head and he bings his fingers up to my mouth and I open up my mouth and the taste is just mind blowing I couldn't help but to close my eyes and let out a moan I open my eyes so see Evan staring at me then  he brings his finger up to his mouth and licks it  I search his eyes and realized that his eyes are to beautiful "Wow""What it is" Evan said smiling ,I can't believe I said that out loud"Nothing""Come on you can tell me" I search his eyes again "Your eyes there so beautiful" I see him blush "Thanks" I nod "Do you want to eat know I get the plates out" Evan said to me He started moving around my kitchen and he looked like he new my kitchen better them me and I live her .
We eat in silence for a while until Evan decides to start a conversation"So you work at a bakery do u like to bake""Yes I love to bake"

She just so beautiful and luscious I could just jump across this table and take her right now, she only made it worst when she came down stair naked and and I got a full view of her gorgeous body if she only knew what I would do damn I need her bad After we finish up breakfast she tells me she need to get to work so I reluctantly leave and go to my new house I look out the window and see Ashley start to get in her range rover and start it but it doesn't come on she does it again and it still doesn't come on maybe I could help her out and get her to like me
