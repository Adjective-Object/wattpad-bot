==============
"Jane!" My mum calls up to me "we you have to go to Annalise's in an hour" I drag myself out of my warm cosy bed and get in the shower.I use my Zoella shower cream. After I get out I grab a pair of Adidas yoga pants and a tank top and I put on a pair of black and white Nikes when I go to the kitchen I have a granola bar. I run up stairs and open my cupboard a get my converse over night bag and put 2 pairs of clothes and put them in. I put my lollies and my make up bag. Just then mum walks in "time to go sweetie!" She said poping her head in the door. I quickly grab my laptop its charger, my iPhone and it's charger and my iPod and it's charger then my head phones. When I get there emily was already there. We played a kidnapping game for about an hour before we started getting hungry."Grain waves?" Annalise asks rummaging through the pantry "sour cream and chives" she said taking 3 bags out, we ran up to her room and watched YouTube aka Zoella!! And played our iPhones and scrolled our laptops.
