Hey im y/n, I lived with my parents and got everything I wanted. I didnt care what was going on, while I had a absolutely perfect life- at least thats what I thought. It all changed on that one day when my parents where schemed and then assassinated. Since then I cant trust anyone , learnt nen and im always on my guard. Ive learnt how hard it is when your all alone and when theres no one to look out for you.I never thoght about money, warmth,  food, water- now I have to steal it. To survive in this world. I used to say to my mum
" I will never  steal"
And she would reply
"I know you wont"
She must be disgusted at me.
This was when my life turned around.
