I walked into my first period class. Math. "I heard Mr. Holland is suppose to be pretty cute." My bestfriend Ally told me. Boy, was she right. That dark messy hair and his jawline were perfect.
"Okay class, find a seat please and I'll take attendance." He looked at his paper with everyone's name and started saying names. I spaced out until he got to my name.
"Alexa Donaldson." I raised my hand and he looked in my direction. We made eye contact for about five seconds then I looked away as his eyes scanned me. He cleared his throat. "Um, is John Golding here?"
"He was just checking you out." Ally whispered to me. "No he wasn't." She laughed silently. "Did you not see the way he looked at you?" "That doesn't mean anything."
"We're all going to say something about ourselves to get to know each other." He said and glanced at me. "Would you like to start us off Alexa?" I looked at him and he gave me a small smile. "Well, I enjoy reading, I'm a pretty good cook, and I don't really have an interesting life." He chuckled and smiled at me.
I smiled back, and once again, we made eye contact longer than we should. Ally nudged me and I looked away quickly. "Um, someone else go." He said.
Everyone said stuff that I didn't pay attention to until the bell rang. Everyone packed and left and I purposely moved slow so I would be the last one out. "You never told us anything about you."
