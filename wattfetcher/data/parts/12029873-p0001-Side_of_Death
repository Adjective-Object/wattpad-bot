Introduction
There was shouting. Cursing.
This fight between my parents was serious. They fought once in a while, but it had never been as bad as it was now. It really worried me. I genuinely feared a divorce would happen.
My older sister, Rebecka, and I watched the fight through the cracks of our bedroom door. We couldn't afford to have separate rooms because we lived in the poor side of the country. Meanwhile on the other side, it was common to have 8 rooms in each house.
Those spoiled brats.
The two silhouettes depicted our parents, fighting to the point it scared me.
"I'm telling you, Gemma! You don't know how well paid the job is!"
"And I'm telling you it's too risky! We send our kids to school, they have friends! And now you're telling me we move north? How are we going to buy coats, a new home?"
"Listen to me, you stubborn b!tch, we'll figure out a way!"
I flinched when my dad cursed at my mom. I turned around, seizing Rebecka's arm. 6 years older than me, she gave me comfort from her presence. I pressed my face into her arm and choked back a sob.
"What's going to happen?" I asked her, barely making a sound to avoid being heard by my parents.
Her voice was low and comforting. "It'll all be ok, Eden. Nothing's going to happen." Turns out, she lied.
