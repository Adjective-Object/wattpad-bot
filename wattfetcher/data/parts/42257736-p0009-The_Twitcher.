Troyian's POV :
We walked out of the crowd and walked into the girls bathrooms.
As soon as we got in there she flinched away from me.
I felt empty as soon as she was out of my arms.
"Hi! I'm Troyian Winter." I introduced boldy.
She just looked away and kept twitching.
"What's your name?" I asked as I bent down next to her.
She was sat against the long mirror on the wall which was located next to the sink.
"J-jacey Wells" she replied
"Sorry about Sam and Cyrus I'm sure they didn't mean any harm." I apologized
She started laughing.
"That's bullsh*t" She laughed
"No he is a good guy..." I stated.
"You sure sound confident about that" She puffed
I noticed she had stopped crying.
I decided to change the subject.
"Are you new here?" I asked as I slid down the wall next to her.
"Started here yesterday." She said bluntly
"Wait did you say your last name was Wells?" I asked
"Yes." She stated
"Are you Mr and Mrs Wells daughter?!" I asked
"Yes." She said
"Omg I heard there daughter was coming back!" I said
"Well I'm back." She sassed
"What class do you have now?" I asked
"Math" she whined.
"Hey me too! Wanna walk together?" Her eyes lit up at my request.
I stood up and lifted her off the dirty red tiles.
We walked to maths and I found out she was in my math class.
She walked to the back of the room so I decided I would go and sit with her.
She shot me a glare.
"What are you doing?" She asked quietly.
"I'm sitting in math" I said sassily.
Tyler sat next to Jacey.
Tyler is Sam's twin.
Sam as in my boyfriend Sam.
She just huffed and continued on with her work.
I like the way her light brown hair falls in front of her eyes when she looks down.
I like the way her pale skin illuminates in the white lighting of the math room.
And her eyes have a slight twinkle in her blue iris.
Wait why am I thinking about her like this?
Probably just a friend crush.
The bell went and Tyler dragged Jacey out of the room.
So I just continued on to photography.
My favorite subject.
I walked into the dark room and began processing some of my photos for my assignment.
Just as I finished my first photo the door opened.
