You would not believe your eyesIf ten million firefliesLit up the world as I fell asleep'Cause they'd fill the open airAnd leave tear drops everywhereYou'd think me rudeBut I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugsFrom ten thousand lightning bugsAs they tried to teach me how to danceA foxtrot above my headA sock hop beneath my bedThe disco ball is just hanging by a thread(Thread, thread...)
I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems(When I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack(Please take me away from here)'Cause I feel like such an insomniac(Please take me away from here)Why do I tire of counting sheep?(Please take me away from here)When I'm far too tired to fall asleep(Ha-ha)
To ten million firefliesI'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyesI got misty eyes as they said farewell(Said farewell)But I'll know where several areIf my dreams get real bizarre'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar(Jar, jar, jar...)
I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seems(When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believeThat planet Earth turns slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleepBecause my dreams are bursting at the seams
