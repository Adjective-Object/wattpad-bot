"Austin?"
"What?" I snapped.
Someone pushed the curtain away and Alan's head popped in, "Are you okay?"
"Oh I'm fucking great."
He gave me a look, "Sure you are. Look, I came to check on you but if you're just going to be a dick I can just go." He said and started to leave.
"No, wait. I'm sorry."
"It's fine," He said looking back at me, "You wanna talk about it?"
I shrugged, "I fell for Jaxin's bullshit again."
"Your ex right?"
I nodded.
"Why would you do that?"
"Because I thought he meant it this time." I told him, "I always believe him when he says he's changed but it's all a lie everytime."
"I'm sorry."
I shook my head, "It's not your fault."
"I know, but it still sucks." He said and hugged me. I smiled and wrapped my arms around him hugging him back.
"It really does."
We stood there hugging for a little longer than necessary before he pulled away.
"He was a dick anyways." Alan said smiling, "You deserve someone better than that."
"Thanks." I said.
"No problem." He told me.
"Hey what did you want to show me last night?"
"Oh, it was just a picture. It doesn't matter."
"No, I wanna see it." I whined.
"Okay."  He said and went back to his bunk and grabbed his camera before coming back to me. "Here. I wanted to prove that the stars can be cool if you take the picture right."
"Oh wow." I said looking down at the picture, "They look amazing."
"Yeah, I love taking these pictures."
"It looks really cool."
"Yeah."
"You're really good at this kind of stuff." I said and handed him his camera back.
He blushed, "Thanks."
"No problem, by the way I'm sorry about how rude Jaxin was last night."
"No its fine. He seemed territorial, I get it. He wanted to mark his territory, he wanted me gone."
"Yeah well I'm still sorry, I told him he had nothing to worry about anyways."
"He thought he had something to worry about?"
"Yeah." I said laughing a little, "Crazy huh?"
"Yeah, real crazy." He giggled.
"That's why I told him he shouldn't worry." I told him feeling a little crushed.
He laughed before it quieted down between us. The air seemed a little awkward.
"So I think I'm going to go get something to eat." I said after a bit of awkward silence, "Want anything?"
