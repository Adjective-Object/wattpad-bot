"Justin wake up" I yelled
"Just five more minutes" he mumbled putting his face further in the pillow
I guess I'm making breakfast I thought walking into the kitchen and pulling out the bacon and everything else I turned on the stove and pulled out the frying pan and fried the bacon and put it on a paper towel covered plate then started on everything else
One hour later
When I finished making breakfast I pulled out two plates and made mine and Justin's then set them on the table then walked into the living room and shook Justin
"Justin wake up"I said shaking him
"Just five more minutes"he mumbled putting the pillow over his head
"I made breakfast "I said crossing my arms
Right then he shot up and ran straight for the kitchen and straight to the table
"Here "I said handing him silverware
Then he took a bite and then another and then another
"Slow down before you choke "I said
""What can I say I love food "he said taking another bite
"I can tell " I joked
"And what is that supposed to mean " Justin said looking up from his plate then taking a bite out of his bacon
"Nothing "I said innocently
"Sure "he said sarcastically
Then he finished what was on his plate and then took mine and took it to the sink to wash
"What do you think your doing" I demanded
" what does it look like I'm doing I'm doing the dishes this is my house you're my guest I do the cooking and cleaning and you just relax OK " he stated
"I can't let you do everything "I said
"Get over it "he joked while running the dish water
"At least let me dry them"I sighed
"No I'm doing them now sit "he said sternly
" fine "I said
"Well I'm gonna get dressed while you finish up " I said getting up and pushing my chair in
"Why where are you going "he asked
"I promised Sutton and the girls I would hang with them today" I said
"Why don't they come over here and go swimming so I can spend time with my girl" Justin said finishing up the dishing then wrapping his arms around my waist
"And I can call the guys also "he added
"OK I'll call the girls " I said smiling
"Now go get ready "I said pushing him towards the stairs
"How about a kiss first "he said smirking
"Ha no morning breath so not till you brushing your teeth now go "I said pushing him again
"Fine miss bossy"he said holding his hands up in defense and stomping up the stairs
"Just go Bieber"I said rolling my eyes
I walked into the bathroom downstairs and fixed my hair into a ponytail and changed into my bathing suit and slipped into my slipover and brushed my teeth and used justins mouthwash and left the bathroom
