Rian's POV :
I escaped finally. Away from the monster of Brandon. I got raped and abused for the last time tonight. See the story is when I was younger, my father was murdered and I was the last to see him. My whole family thought it was me who killed him. I'm still a murder suspect. I didn't do it. I saw my mother do it.
After that my mother married someone named Brandon. I was 10 at the time so I was happy my mother was happy. But when my mother was out at her job Brandon would rape me. My mother knew nothing about it. I was too afraid to tell her.
So here I sit. For the last time. I take a look at the river in front of me. The last thing I will see before my tragic suicide. I was raped for the last time tonight.
I gripped the edge of the bridge tightly as the cold air froze my tears and my arms. I only came out here with skinnies and a tank. I left my converse on the bridge.
As I was about to let go I heard someone shout at me above the winds. "STOP! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS! YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR." The mystery man screamed. I gripped onto the bridge yet again. Only this time, I was only hanging off of the edge.
"STOP! OR I'LL.. I'LL... I'LL JUMP!!" I screamed back. The guy stopped and looked at me.
He had long black hair with black makeup around his eyes. He had two lip piercings on his bottom lip on the right side. He wore all black.
"YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.. You have a lot to live for. You look very young." He said. As the wind died down. I looked at him with tears in my eyes.
"You don't know me. I'm abused and broken. I deserve this." I said. I looked down and I didn't even realize that he was next to me till he put his hand out for me to take.
"Then let me help you, and get to know you." He said. I looked at him and took his hand. He noticed that j was cold and I couldn't walk from all of the shock so he put his jacket around me and carried me to his car.
I can't believe I was about to jump. I do deserve a second chance don't I?
"I'm ricky by the way.." He looked at me and smiled. I looked down and blushed.
"I'm rian.." I said. Well more like mumbled. He looked like he was thinking and then he smiled.
"Rian. That's a beautiful name." I blushed even more and put my knees up to my chest.
"Listen, rian, you don't have to be afraid anymore. I want to help." Ricky said. He put his hand on my shoulder. I had a feeling that was a promise.
