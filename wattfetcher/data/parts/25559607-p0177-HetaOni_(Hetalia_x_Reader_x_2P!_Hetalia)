"That's right... I have started to understand why my fratello and Spain are here...but I have no idea how you ended up here, bella." Italy stated, turning to the (hair colour) haired girl.


The girl met the Northern Italian's gaze and became a bit nervous. "Well...I have told some of you guys about this but...I'll explain it to everyone now..."
