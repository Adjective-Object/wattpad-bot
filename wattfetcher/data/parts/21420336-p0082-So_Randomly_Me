PARENTS
YES I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT NOW
PARTICULARLY DIVORCED PARENTS OR PARENTS WITH ISSUES
BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE THOSE XD
So like divorce parents have a thing of telling you all the things they hate about the other one
Like"OMG I SWEAR UR DAD IS SUCH A USELESS BASTARD"
Me: here we go again...
"HE DOESNT DO SHIT!"
Me: are u done?
"UGH"
~~~~
They also like to take their anger on you
Like just a few minutes ago my mom was yelling at me because my dad gave me way too little medicine and didn't tell her the name
An she yells at me
Me, being the "calm" person I am asked her why she was yelling at me
Of course she said she wasn't yelling.
~~~They also threaten u about because of the other person
Like"I'm so done, you know what? I'm trying to be nice but he's in for it. I'm sorry but you won't be able to see him anymore if he keeps this up."
Which is completely unfair
He's my DADI don't care if he has done bad things in the pastLike everytime I'm just sad I think,"At least I have both my parents that's something." And then she does that??
Okay I'm sorry I need to go calm down I'm sorry I'll finish later
