-Ariana's POV-
As I am sitting across from Justin we are laughing and joking around. We are in this very fancy restaurant with really good food. I go to take a sip of my water while Justin is talking,
he says "Ariana can we talk after dinner?"
I stop. I just thought, he's dumping me, he's dumping me, he's dumping me.
I go to take a sip of my water and take a bite of my steak. Then we start laughing and talking like nothing happened.
After dinner I take him outside and said "what do you need to talk about?" he gives a worried face, but he looked more nervous then worried. He said "Ari I feel like we need to take  our relationship to a whole new level." I stand there tilting my head slowly and then I figure it out. He wants sex. I freeze because I trust him but I just don't want to loose my virginity at 18. Then I just think how much I love him, we do need to take it to a whole new level.
