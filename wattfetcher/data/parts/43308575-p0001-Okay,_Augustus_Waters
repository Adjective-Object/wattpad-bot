I was 13 when they found it. Pretty much worse case scenario. Thyroid stage four. Not much they could do. Which didn't stop them, of course. Surgery, radiation, chemo, more radiation, all of which worked for a while, but then stopped working. Then one day my lungs started filling up with water. I couldn't breathe. No one could get it under control. That should have been the end. But then something happened: the antibiotics kicked in, they drained the fluid from my lungs. I got my strength back. Next thing you know, I was an experimental child. You know, those ones whose names are all over the papers and the news. The famous ones. But now I'm stuck with this thing. It's called a philanksifur. It didn't work for 70% of participants, but for some reason it worked with me. So they called it the miracle. My lungs still suck at being lungs, but theoretically, they can continue to suck like this for the rest of my life.
