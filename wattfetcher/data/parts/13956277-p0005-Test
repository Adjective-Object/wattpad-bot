NOT EDITED**
"Wake up love"
Someone shook my shoulder as I weakly opened my eyes
"At last" the man sighed
"GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME"Â  jumped
"What happened" Elina ran to me
"Call the police these two are gonna kill us" I ran to my phone.
They all laughed loudly even Mrs.Carter.
"You know what leena ? Last time I checked, they told me I was a human being" The young guy said.
"Leena, meet Damon and Harold, My son and my Husband" Mrs.Carter said .
My jaw dropped, "You've gotta be kidding me" I glared at them
"Welcome to the family Leena" Damon ran to me with wide opened arms offering me a hug and I started running around the table while he was giggling and following me.
"DON'T TOUCH ME OR I WILL RIP YOUR HEAD OFF OF YOUR NECK" I shouted and Damon froze.
"What's wrong" Mr.Carter asked.
"Thank you for everything sir but I can't stay here" I answered.
"Why !We haven't had our first date yet" Damon mocked
"Shut up" Elina told him and I mouthed a "Thank you" to her.
"I know my brother is annoying but you'll get used to him, he's actually very friendly" Elina begged me to stay.
"It's not about your brother, it's that living with foregin men in the same house is not allowed for me" I answered.
"Said who" Damon asked.
"Said my religion and traditions" I answered and he rolled his eyes
"Pleeeeaasssseeee" Elina begged
"Sorry, but a mistake must've happened because I was supposed to be with a mom and her little daughter" I explained.
"We'll discuss that tomorrow morning, now all of you , go to bed" Mr.Carter commanded.
We walked up the stairs, me and Damon were the last ones "I'm gonna make these 2 years the best of your life babe" Damon whispered in my ear.
"Astaghferollah" I said then headed to my room.
"Pissssssssssstttt, In case you needed anything, or any thief came, my room is in front of yours" Damon winked at me and I gave him that glare, my famous glare that makes you wish you didn't exist.
"Don't Give me that look babe" He walked towards my door then "BAAAAMMMMM" I shut it with all the force I had.
"What the hell are you doing" I heard Mr.Carter telling Damon
"Uggh you know errrmm comforting her yeah" Damon stumbled.
"Listen to me kid, she's a guest so don't try any of you stupid moves, I heard that she knows some karate" Mr.Carter warned him and I giggled
This family seems nice, but I can't stay here.

NEXT DAY:
"KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK" Someone almost broke the door.
"Who is it?" I slowly opened my eyes, but no one answered so I put my hijab on and opened the door.
"Morning love" My eyes widened when I saw a shirtless black-haired tanned muscular guy with light blue eyes
