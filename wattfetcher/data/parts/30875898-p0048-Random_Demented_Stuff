Don't say that your sorry for all the things that happened to me.
Saying sorry won't change the fact that I hate myself, it won't change the fact that my two best friends sexually assaulted me. Saying sorry won't change the fact that my dad emotionally, physically, and mentally abuses me. Saying sorry won't change the fact that I have lost everyone that I've ever loved. The fact that you say that you feel sorry for me doesn't help the fact that I'm addicted to pills, and that I can't go one day without having a mental breakdown. It won't change the fact that sometimes I think no really cares, or that sometimes I just want to die.
How the hell does the word 'sorry' help me?!
I DON'T FUCKING WANT YOUR GOD DAMN PITY, OKAY?!?!?!?!
Just don't talk to me... Saying words to me, it doesn't help... It doesn't nmake me feel any better... It just... it only makes me feel worse... I just... I don't know anymore... I'm sorry.....
