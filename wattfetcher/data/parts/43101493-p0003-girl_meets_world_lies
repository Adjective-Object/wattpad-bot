I ran down a dark and shady alley. I about died when I heard a horrible screech of a cat. I sat down on a trash can and thought I don't want to go home tonight. I'll go to Jake's I thought. I ran past houses people cars to a 2 story apartment complex. I went up the elevator to number 6 I knocked on the Jhonsons door. Jake opened the door. I flung my arms around him. "I love you!I missed you so much!" Jake just nodded his head and patted me on the back. "Come in" he said. Jake was a friend I've had since preschool he spilt his juice box in me and the rest is history. He's just my age 13 he has light Brown hair and blue eyes. I kind of have a crush on him besides Lucas well I'm not exactly sure what I think of Lucas now. I'm not going to speak to Him ever again. We were both sitting on the couch for like 2 minuets before I broke the akward silence. "Where have you been? you haven't been at school since last year!" "My mom died and I don't have the funds to pay off school so I've been living off the money she said when she was dying to only use first food and bills for the house. "Why didn't you tell me!! " I demanded urgently . "Because I had no way to contact you! ". "It doesnt matter now you can come live with my mom and I. "What if I want you to live with me? " he asked. "Oh Jake" "well what's so different?! " "not much I admitted " "OK so Maya Hart will you live with me? " "Yes" was all i said./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Jake so far is the only character I own in this book so give me credit to use him
