Finally. I've been waiting for this song to get out. I'm sorry if you guys like this song but I think it's really annoying. I thought it would of been the first one out. However this one didn't even get a single vote till a few chapters ago. Anyway if you voted this song out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!
And the nominees are:
SMILE SONG
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
PINKIE'S LAMET
A FRIEND FOR LIFE
Good luck to the nominees!
