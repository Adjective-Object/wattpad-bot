Jerome sat on the bench in the middle of the park.A single tear fell from his eye and rolled down his cheek. Him and his friend, or should I say his boyfriend, had gotten into a fight. Mitch refused to answer texts and was not home. Someone sat next to him but jerome refused to look up. He felt someone wipe the tear of his cheek. It was Mitch."Go away. You don't love me.""Of course I do.why would I come back?" Mitch replied.Mitch's lips touched Jerome's cheek.Jerome hugged him.#Merome
