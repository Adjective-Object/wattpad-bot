Hi guys!  This is my second story, the first I wrote I didn't like the plot very much and I was running out of ideas of continuations.  Anyways, I hope you like this story!  I will try to update once a week.  Here is some background information.
Summary:
Everett Waterford, a 15-year-old girl attending Asher Academy, a school where people like her are taught to use their element powers to full strength.  Just before the day they would open the building from remodeling over the summer, a bomb seems to have been planted in the Academy.  Since nothing but the forest surrounds them, and considering the location is on an island, Everett teams up with Adam, who just happens to be the only one around and is the sworn enemy element.  With the help of her cat Midnight, and Adam's eagle Blitz, both Adam and Everett must put aside their differences to stay alive.
