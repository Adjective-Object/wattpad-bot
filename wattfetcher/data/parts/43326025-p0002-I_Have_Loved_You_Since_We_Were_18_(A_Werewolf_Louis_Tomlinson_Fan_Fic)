"Mom! I was at Louis party! I told you where I went!" I said.
"Oh, well. don't scare me like that! Your brother was so worried because he wanted you to read him a bed time story." she hugged me.
Once she released me, I went to my room and changed out of my dress and into my favorite pair of batman pajamas. I turned off the lights and lied in bed. I asked myself some questions.
If Louis was hiding something, what was it?
If he did have a secret, would he tell me?
What if he was that werewolf that I shot in the shoulder?
I asked myself those questions until I fell asleep soundly. :)
