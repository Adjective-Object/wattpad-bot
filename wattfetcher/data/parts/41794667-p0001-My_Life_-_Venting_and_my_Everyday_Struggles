Hey everyone, I want to start off by saying that this is my life and my feelings/thoughts and not anyone else's. Depression and anxiety have consumed my life for over the past year, and I'm trying my hardest to fight back. I'm here to write down my thoughts, but also to be there for anyone else who may be feeling the same way. You're never truly alone in your struggles. I'm here and even though I don't know you guys, I know how you feel and we can get through life together. Life throws some crazy things at us, but I believe that we are never truly alone. If you want to read my thoughts, go ahead. If you're feeling the same as I am, feel free to comment and let me know. *Some parts may be triggering, as I am struggling with depression and anxiety. And none of this is meant to be offensive, it's just my thoughts and what I'm feeling in the moment.*
So, let's start off with a little bit about me. I'm a teenage girl and as I've said a few times already, I struggle with depression and anxiety every day. I'm an honors student and also a perfectionist, which makes it all worse. I feel like I have to be perfect and if I'm not, I'm a total failure. My parents don't pressure me to do well in school, it's something I'm doing to myself. School is pretty much the only thing I'm good at, so I try my hardest to be as close to perfect as I can be. My parents are divorced and I have a little sister and a dog. I'm very grateful to have friends that I can always talk to about anything. They keep me going, and they're the reason I'm still fighting. I see my therapist every week, and she is so amazing. Even though I still struggle, I'm better than I was a year ago. I'm so grateful to have so many great people in my life, and hopefully this "diary" will show progress as time goes on. With that said, enjoy reading my thoughts!
