"Shit. Well I have to go." I told them and grabbed my wallet laying enough money down  to pay for my and Kellins meal.
"I'll go with you." Kellin said and stood up.
"We'll see you guys later." Alan said waving at us.
"Bye." I said and took Kellins hand the two of us left quickly.
"That was fun." Kellin said once we were out of there.
"Yeah it was, we'll have to do it more often." I said.
"Definitely. It'll be good."
I nodded and we walked the rest of the way back talking about random things and once we got to the bus where we were going to do the interview everything was already set up and and the guys were glaring at us.
"What did I do?" I asked them.
"You're late."
"Sorry, sorry."
"Whatever just get over here."
"I'm here." I said walking over and sitting by Tony.
"Alright now that you're all here we can get started." The dude said but I didn't really pay attention to anything they really said as I watched Kellin trying not to laugh at all of the stupid faces he kept making. He was adorable.
"Vic." I stopped looking at Kellin and paid attention to the interviewer.
"Yes?"
"A question a lot of fans asked was why did you punch Jonny in the face?"
"Oh uh there was just something going on between the two of us but we have it all worked out now." I lied and smiled at him, "We're all good now."
"Does this mean everyone will be hearing the songs tonight at the show?"
I sighed, "Of course, wouldn't want anyone to miss them."
"That's great, which song do you like performing more?" He asked.
"Well I can tell you which one I like better, "  Mike said. "Anything but Dirty Words. Do you even want to know how weird it is hearing your big brother sing about how great he is in bed?"
Tony and Jaime nodded in agreement and thankfully the whole subject was dropped. The rest of the interview went by agonizingly slow but it didn't matter because as soon as it was finished I was back with Kellin.
"Thanks for entertaining me." I told him as we went to my bunk.
"It's fine, you looked bored as hell." He said smiling, "And now you can pay me back by helping me set up the merch table for tonight."
"But that's boring!" I whined.
"Well that sucks, now lets go get some boxes full of merch and set the funnest place on earth up." He said grabbing my hand, "Grab what you need we got to go."
"I don't need anything." I mumbled and Kellin smiled.
"Good, now let's go get the merch." He said and started dragging me out of the bus.
"You do realize I have sound check in like 45 minutes right?"
"Enough time for you to help me set up." He said and I groaned oh my god I'm going to die of boredom.
Austin's POV
"Why are cellphones so expensive?" Alan asked as we walked out of the phone store.
"I don't know but at least we have working ones now."
