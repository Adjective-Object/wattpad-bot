I don't think I've ever stopped to realize how shitty I am. I know, I know, I kind of have. Except this isn't the shitty I mean. When I say I've realized how shitty I am I mean the fact that I do this to myself. If anyone were to call a friend of mine anything I say about myself, I'd probably punch them. I may not be physically harming myself but everything I do isn't golden either. It's shitty that I lock myself away. That I lie for other people's sake. That I smile and nod and accept what's happening when I know for a fact that I could change it. It's shitty that I am afraid of myself. I'm afraid of the big bad reflection. I'm afraid of the anxiety attacks. I'm afraid of the dreams. I'm afraid of what may happen. But yet I do nothing to change it positively.
I don't think you get how it feels, to be kept prisoner in your own body. I think of so many things I could do but the output is always "No". I just want things to go well. I want to be able to act on what I think and not some shitty impulse. I want to be myself. I don't care if no one likes it at this point. I've spent far too long locking him up.

My depression isn't just sadness. It's anger. Isolation. Fear. Acting recklessly.
My anxiety isn't just rocking back and forth and crying. It's avoidance. False smiles. Screaming.
My ADHD isn't just acting out. It's silence, believe it or not. Stressed laughter. Not remembering things. Poor follow through.
BPD. It's not just dissociating. It's not knowing who I am. If I'm truly the male I wish to be. It's not knowing if I honestly hate myself. It's not knowing if what I say is true. It's saying "I hate you" when everything in my head is screaming love.
God. Just. All of those illnesses aren't me. None of those are how I feel but I can't control it. I just want to be me. Is that so much to ask.
