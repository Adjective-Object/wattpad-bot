I sat slowly. I don't get it why was it a feast anyway. It's just breakfast. Who has a breakfast feast? "This is to celebrate Zayn's two new adorable adoptions." Harry said. "Yup. Today is gonna be a busy day. Kind of." I smiled. I might as well just eat what they give. It's not like it's gonna stay there but the food. The food man. It just looks awesome. "Here you go." Niall said giving us the utensils that we needed. I started going in. I don't care how I looked. I liked to eat. Yeah it hurts but I'm not gonna stop. If I stopped doing something every time something hurt I wouldn't be doing a lot of things. Like walking. After shoving food in my throat, I looked at the boys as an explanation of what am I supposed to do now. " Next we go shopping." I could feel my eyes sparkle. They do that. When someone I love or something I love to do is mentioned, they sparkle. Awesome right. I know. I decided that I would go the way I was dressed now. I picked up Brianna and went to her room. Might as well help her. "Will you pick out an outfit for me?" I smiled and put her on her bed. I went to her closet going through her clothes. She didn't have a lot. I'm even more happy now. I picked out an white long sleeve with a bow on it and a blue tutu. "Will you do my hair for me too." I laughed. I took out the scrunchy in my hair cause it was killing me. "I like how your hair falls down and its not even messed up." I laughed. "She's right." I looked at the door and saw Harry. I smiled at him. "No problem. Anyways. I came to tell you were leaving soon." I nodded. I combed through her hair and curled it a bit and put a white flower. "Wow." Brianna was breathless. I took a small cross bag off one of her hooks and gave it to her. "What do I put in here?" She asked confused. "You'll get new stuff that you can hold in there." I signed over to her. "LISA!!
