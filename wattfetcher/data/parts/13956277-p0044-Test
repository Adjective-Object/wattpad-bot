"A fork ? really" He gave me the 'what's wrong with you' look.
"Yeah, it has 3 heads so it hurts more".
"I took it from your phone yesterday when you were asleep" He put his hands in my plate of fries but I slapped it.
"Dont touch my fries you sneaky, HOW CAN YOU GET IN MY ROOM WHILE I'M SLEEPING ! WHAT IT I WAS UNCOVERED OR SOMETHING" I scolded him.
"Hey, hey, calm down, you always cover your whole body and head when you sleep"
"Oh Oka- WHAT ! HOW DIS YOU KNOW !!! HAVE YOU BEEN SNEAKING INTO MY ROOM LATELY"
"Let me explain, sometimes I just need to do my homeworka but I don't know how, so I copy yours"
"YOU CHEATER *throws shoese at him* YOU GET EXTRA MARKS BECAUSE OF ME"
"Ouch, relax Im sorry"
"Never mind, I'll tel the teacher later. Now, What did yiu tell my father" I raised an eyebrow.
"I just told him how happy you are and that you can defwnd yourself and dont let any guy cross the lines ... something like that" He ate some of Elina's potatoes.
"Give me those you stealer. Either you say the truth or I'll stab you, that wouldn't have convinced my father, so I'm gonna ask you One-more-time, what did you tell me father ?" I threatened him.
"I told him that I'll sleep outside in the room beside the pool and won't spend much time here if it makes him more comfortable, it's not a big deal" Damon turned the TV on.

"What ? you really don't have to"
"It's Okay, mom already agreed" He smiled.
"I really don't know what to say"
"It's okay, plus, I get to get my girlfriend without having mom interrupting us every minute" He winked.
"so you didn't do it for me ha?" I giggled
"No, It was totally for you, I already broke up with my girlfiend" He gave me half a smile
"A man shouldn't play with girls' hearts, I didn't love her, so the best thing to do was to tell her the truth before using her and tearing her heart"
"Thank you Damon for helping me" I smiled shyly
"YOU'RE BLUSHING" He laughed loudly and I blushed more.
"Does that mean you like me" He winked.
"NO, that means that I'm really greatfull for your kindness, but here you go again and act like a jerk and ruin the golden moment, AGAIN" I walked to my room.
"Thank you too for the advice"
"What advice" I asked
"The man thing" He smile shyly
"Oh yeah, you're welcome" I closed the door.
"Can you at least have a cup of coffee with me, I've done you a favor"
"I happen to be the best in making cold Mocha" I opened the door enthusiastically.
"That's great" He smiled.
"But I'm not gonna make you one. I still hate you" I shut the door in his face.
"I hate you" He chuckled then left.
"I really wish you do" I giggled
Elina broke into my room.
