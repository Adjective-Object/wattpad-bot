Katsumi:*watching the final episode of Madoka Magica*
Katsumi:I CANT BELIEVE HOMURA TURNED EVIL!!!!!!!!!!
Novu:*pops out of nowhere*Im not evil anymore...I guess.
Chiyomi:*pops out of nowhere*I was never evil.
Katsumi:Im talkin' about Homura Akemi.
Katsumi:And Homura are ur surnames.
Chiyomi:...
Novu:...
Chiyomi:Well I better get goin'!Or else Ayame will be mad!*pops away*
Novu:Well Im going home.*pops away*
Katsumi:..........
Katsumi:WHY HOMURA?!!!!!!!!!
-END-
I didn't really watch Madoka Magica.I only watch the final part where Homura turns to a devil.And if your wondering who Chiyomi is,she is from the game Corpse Party:Dead Patient.She is Ayame's friend.That game was messed up!Zombies' everywhere!
