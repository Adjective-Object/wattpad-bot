"Are you Okay William ?" Hannah asked.
"Are you Okay William ?" I mocked.
"Yes, I am" He said.
I heard someone stand up and walk toward me then sat beside me.
"Hey" Peter said.
"Now you too ??" I raised an eyebrow at him.
"Hey" Tom came.
"You too must be up to something" I raised an eyebrow at them.
"Here's the plan" Tom whispered the plan to me.
"Okay".
.....
The movie finished, I told Tom and Peter to get back to their seats then I turned the lights on and saw everyone shaking in their places.
"You call yourself men ?" I raised an eyebrow at them.
The lights went of, They all freaked out and screamed. The lights came back again.
"Where's the bathroom" I asked.
"Upstairs" Simon said
I went upstairs, the lights went off. That's the sign.
"Tom" I whispered.
"I'm here, Do it now"
"HELP HELP ME PLEASE HE HAS A KNIFE" I shouted.
Everyone downstairs screamed.
"such chickens" I whispered to Tom.
"Yeah I agree" He whispered back.
"So, they're not coming ?" I whispered.
"HELP" I shouted again and walked silently to the stairs to hear what they are saying.
"We should save her" Damon said.
"You should go upstairs" Jake said.
"I-I- No, you go" Damon said, I thought he finally became a man. disappointing.
William and Lewis didn't do any movement, I wasn't expecting anything from them, they hate me.
I thought Jake was going to come but he didn't move.
"HELPPP" I shouted again.
"Come on girls, she's our friend" Molly said, the girls agreed and stood up.
"No, I'll go" Simon said. I'm surprised.
"But-"
"I SAID I'LL GO" Simon cut his sister off. He entered a room and got out quickly holding something.
"Put my father's gun back" Molly said.
What ?!!Â  Gun ?
"This thing is getting serious" I whispered to Tom.
I heard footsteps on the stairs.
"quick, Give me the ketchup and hide and tell Peter to turn the light on after 2 minutes" I whispered to Tom and he nodded.
I put ketchup on my neck and chest and lied on the floor.
"LEENA" Simon shouted.
The lights came back.
"LEEEEEENAAAAAA" He knelt beside me.
I heard many footsteps running on the stairs.
I heard gasps.
I heard sobs.
