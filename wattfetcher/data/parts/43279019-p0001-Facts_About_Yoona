TRIVIA !!!
Widely known as the "center" image of SNSD thanks to her immense popularity among Korean public. Age-wise, she's also placed in the "center" of SNSD; Seohyun (born in 1991) is a year younger than Yoona (born in 1990) and the other 7 members are one year older and considered as same-age friends (born in 1989 and Sooyoung in early 1990).

The physically strongest member of SNSD, gained her a nickname Him Yoona (strong Yoona).

Despite her sweet girlish image, Yoona is actually boyish. One of her well-known nickname is Im-choding (elementary-school boy Im).

Being the the second youngest of SNSD doesn't stop her to be one of their biggest prankster.
