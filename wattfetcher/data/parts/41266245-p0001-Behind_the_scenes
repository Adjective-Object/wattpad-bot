Aaliyah
I sat there nodding as the Director told me what to do this for the next scene. I was going to walk in the room, yelling, demanding Oscar (my co-star) where he put the knife is that will solve the case. After that, we will get into a fight which i will smack him, then it will be scene 7.
Director Smith: "ok aaliyah, you got it?" I nodded and he continued, "ok places everyone!" I went to my place down the hall with Terrae (my other co-star) behind me.
John sat on the couch that was placed in the scene.
Director smith: "scene 7, take 30, Action!" He yelled. I took a deep breath, time to get into character. I walked down the hallway, my heels clacking on the wooden floor.
Me: "Oscar!" I yelled coming to a stop when i got to the living room. John played Oscar, he had blonde hair, blue eyes.
John stood up suddenly his eyebrows drawn, just like we practiced.
John: "Aa- sully!" He messed up, my character's name was Dectective Sully.
Director smith: "cut!" He yelled bedore taking off his hat and walkng towards us. Terrae came out next, she was suppose to come after i smacked him. "Come on you guys, all you have to do is get this scene done, we'll be done after we finish, and i'll go over it tonight," he said rubbing his face
Terrae: "we'll try our best, sir," she said nodding. We all nodded and he walked back over to his seat behind the camera.
We walked back to our places and we finished it

Aaliyah
I sat down the car seat on the porch in attempt to unlock the door to my mansion. once I got it open, I set down car seat, kicked off my flip flops, and closed the door. I bent down and looked at Aniyah (my Daughter), she was spitting bubbles. she laughed as I picked her up from the car seat and put her on my hip.
Me: ''You ready to eat, Mama?'' I asked in a baby voice as I walked in the kitchen. I sat her in her little chair that's right outside the kitchen before looking in the refrigerator for my left over Chipotle. I opened it to see that there was nothing in there. I could've sworn that there was some in here last night. The only two people that would be here would be my older sister, Marcia, and Brother Marcel. There was only one way to find out. I turned around, Grabbed Aniyah, and went upstairs to the security room. I checked the footage from when I left to before I came home.
And there they were. Eating my Chipotle. Smirking. I got something for that. I gonna play it like I don't know. For now. I sighed, and went back down stairs. I sat Niyah back down, and went in the kitchen to look for something else to eat. I didn't find anything else, so I just heated up some mashed potatoes for Niyah.
I sat her down on the ground and she stood up and walked off as i plugged up my phone to my beats pill and went on my playlist. The first thing that came on No Love by August Alsina and Nicki Minaj
I started singing along as i took out the potatoes. I heard someone else singing. i turned around to see Chris (Brown) standing by the Pill in black basketball shorts, and a white wife beater.
Me: ''what you doing here?'' I asked with my eyebrows furrowed.
Chris: ''we havin a sleep over,'' he said looking at me.
me: ''How did you get in?'' I asked, he held up a pair of keys, wiggling them in my face. " I forgot I gave you some keys,'' How could I forget? he over here more than he is at his own house.
