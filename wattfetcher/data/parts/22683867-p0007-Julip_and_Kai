Kai gets physically abused by that boy and he never told her his name. Kai sleeps in a dark room with chains around her neck barely choking her to death. Then the boy opens the door and closes it behind her. When he opened the door again Kai had a gushing purple eye and was crying her heart out while she tried to kill herself by banging her head on the concrete floor while blood drips from her skull and her only strength she has she unclings from the chain and feels for a window and opens it while the sun gives her temporary blindness.  She jumps out and runs for her life wearing a white bloody sheet and finally a man in his late 20s stops in front of her and she asks to take her to the cliff. Kai didn't know why but in her heart it was the place she wanted to go.. Kai looks at a bloody blade and a note and in her heart she knew. .. she stood there and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried. .. Then she read the letter, clutched it in her hand and jumped. ..
