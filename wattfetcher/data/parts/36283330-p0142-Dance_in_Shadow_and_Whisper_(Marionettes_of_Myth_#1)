Yuuhi climbed to his feet. Despite his fatigue, he tried to wear it as best as he could. "She could stay longer, if you needed. I have the proper sustenance to fuel me for a while."
"No, it's quite all right. The longer you keep from your coven, the riskier it will be for all of us. I'm sure she suspects something as it presently stands."
Yuuhi didn't argue that. His eyes ticked away and his face hardened. "I suppose so. I can't promise she won't show up suddenly, unannounced, to check up on me. She has in the past."
I glanced between them. "Is it really safer to move in broad daylight?"
Rajy rested his hand on my shoulder. "It is not safe to move in broad daylight. It is less safe to move at night."
When we headed for the door, my legs felt like rubber, the carpet airy, like my feet never made solid contact with the floor. I wanted to leave. I wanted to escape this cell and breathe fresh air and plant my feet on solid ground again.
And, yet, when I checked over my shoulder, the ache of my hollowed chest returned. I might have been leaving, but I was also leaving Yuuhi behind, still chained to his cell, still chained like a pet to his vampire parent and this life that kept him from the woman he loved.
I wished I could know what his real name was.
I wished I could give it to him.
We filed into the hallway and he nodded to me, his hand on the door. "Keep strong, Kali."
Before he could shut us out, I made sure he heard me say, "Keep strong too."
