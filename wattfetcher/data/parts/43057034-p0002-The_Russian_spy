And pretend to be normal loving parents Step 3: go to the assigned homeStep 4: since we already know that the device is in a school In New Jersey I will have to learn the weird New Jersey accent and learn some 7th grade stuff sense that is the grade I am suppose to be going into for my age.Step 5: befriend everyone and make them trust meStep 6: pretend I'm an average everyday personStep 7: locate the device Step 8: retrieve the device and get out of there as soon as possible Step 9: kill the witnesses which is practically everyoneStep 10: return to Russia
