I: Anthony, the surgery was a success!
A: yeah. i know. and i didn't die!
I: that you didn't.
A: i can't believe you stayed with me throughout all of this.
I: why? i love you, dude! why would i just up and leave you?
A: i don't know...
I: i fucking love you, okay? <3 the day we get separated from the rude pull of death, i will be heartbroken. unless, somehow, we end up being together after we die, then i will be extremely happy again.
A: we can live out eternity in hell, as some rude assholes will believe.
I: my only hell is a place without you <3
A: aw aren't you sweet <3
I: well, i love you <3
A: i love you too, you cheesy poof <3
