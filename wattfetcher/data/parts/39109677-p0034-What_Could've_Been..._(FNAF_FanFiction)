I'm in school right now, and I can honestly say it sucks. I wanna write SOOOOO bad but all my progress is on my computer, right now I'm in my phone in the lunch room. They're giving out our State Test scores...I'll post if I get commended in the next chappie! I guess I'm just bored and that's why I'm on this... See ya in, like, 7 hours!
