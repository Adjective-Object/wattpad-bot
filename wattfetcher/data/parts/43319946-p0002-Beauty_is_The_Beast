Bellamy Wood was walking over. Her lips were dark red as usual, she was wearing a white dress and she had a wide smile on her face. Her pose followed her, the rest of them looked uncomfortable. She sat next to Adam. Her smile grew wider.
"Hey" her voice was sugary. Adam looked at his sandwich

"Adam?" She said
He looked at her face, looked into her blue eyes. They were warm.....but still there was something wrong. Her smile was a bit to wide. Her dark hair was pulled up on the top of her head. the lights in the cafeteria gave her a halo.

She was like a real angel.

"Hey Bellamy" Adam said quietly.

Bellamy looked at him for a second, she reached forward and pushed his hair off of his face.
"that's better " She said
"uh.." Adam started, he couldn't find the words.

"I'm throwing a party tonight" Bellamy said "Do you want to come?"

"Uh...th-thanks but I don't know"

"Aww...I was really looking forward to you coming" She said. She put her arm on his bicep. Her lips curled into a pout. She widened her eyes like a puppy's.

"I-I guess i can go" Adam said, his face must have been red.

Her face changed completely
"Great!" she said
She kissed him on the cheek and got up.

"It starts at 7, down at the abandoned ballet school" She smiled

Adam nodded. He could barely formulate a sentence.

He couldn't go to that party, he felt like he was suffocating already. He couldn't handle it. But he couldn't exactly not go. He said he would be there and he was a man of his word. He smoothed his hair down, and put his hood up. He grabbed his brown paper bag and ran out of the lunch room to somewhere he swore he would never go.

The drama room
