I don't understand my mom. She yells at me whenever she is worried. Like I was just driving a side-by-side and it started jerking back and forth and making a weird sound, and my mom couldn't see me. So she yelled all kinds of crap. So now I'm sitting here on my Grandma's porch, writing this, and have an annoyed face on. That's my life. Also go read and comment on my other random story, 'Ask Me'. I only have one chapter right now because only one person has asked me a question. Ttyl!
