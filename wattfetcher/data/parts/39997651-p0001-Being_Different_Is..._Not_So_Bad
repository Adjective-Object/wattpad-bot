Do you ever feel like your being watched? Or when your alone and you feel as if someone is watching you from somewhere? Or sometimes at school, the teachers look at you as if they are waiting for you to do something at random?
No?
Ok then, it's just me I guess.
•••
Sometimes I feel as if I'm different. I know that your probably thinking 'oh wow! A girl who thinks she's different!' But I'm not talking about it like that.
I'm talking about like, there is another voice in my head that tells me to do things, and I have another voice telling me not to. It's basically like the devil is on one shoulder and an angle on the other sometimes.
Or, I have that one feeling where it seams as if someone I love will get seriously injured or is already hurt in some way.
I feel this way, Everyday and I want answers. My grandmother tells me that she was the same way. I don't understand her sometimes.
: flashback :
"Come on! Let's go already" my best friend yelled. I laughed at her and we piled into the truck with my mom and cousin. We headed to town and we were heading to my sisters house. It has rained the day before and that night, so the roads were slick. My mom was driving and coming up to a red light. My mom hit the breaks but they gave out. The truck kept sliding until we hit the end of another car. The only think I remember from being inside the truck was my face falling forwards to the windshield, then not being able to see out of my right eye. I saw my friend kick the passenger door open and I fell out onto the pavement in the middle of the road. Shards of glass cut my skin and I hissed in pain. I got up but felt dizzy. I looked up at my best friend and she looking like she was going to cry. Her forehead was red and beginning to get a huge bump on it. My cousin came running from the other side and his leg was cut deeply. A sharp pain coursed through my head and I put my hand on my eye I couldn't see out of. I looked down at my shirt and it was covered in blood from my chest to the bottom. I opened my other eye and it burned. I heard police and ambulance sirens off in the distance as my mom was crying her eyes out. I went to her and all the other people who was around us looked at me. I ignored them and hugged my mother.
Soon after, the ambulance arrived and they only took me since I busted the windshield and have glass in my face. They strapped me to a gurdie then rolled me into the van.
The ride to the hospital was bumpy and my head was killing me. They stopped my eyebrow from bleeding and rushed me into the hospital. They scanned my head, hand, and fingers. I couldn't move my right middle and index fingers properly. And they made sure I didn't bust my skull or anything. They put me in a room and I waited for my mom, cousin and best friend to come.
: End of Flashback :
I had a feeling something bad was going to happen that day, but I ignored it because I thought it was just my mind. But I was wrong.
I can sense the future, wether it's bad, or good.
