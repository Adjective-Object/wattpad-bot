Wait, I know her.

"Punzie?"

She looked at me confused, "I'm sorry, do I know you?"

"It's me, Elsa."

"ELSA!" she squealed and hugged me, "I haven't seen you since you were five!"

"I know, it's been ages!"

"What just happened?" said the cute guy with white hair.

"Jack, Merida, Hiccup, this is my cousin Elsa."

"Nice to meet you." They all said in unison.

"Ugh..." I said looking down at the floor shyly, "I should get to my class now."

"Wait, Elsa. There is a party after school, do you want to go to it?" Punzie called out.

"What time, because I have to work at 4-8?"

"Umm, it starts at 9."

"Then sure why not." I shyly shrugged.

"Great, come to my house before, and I will give you a party makeover!"

"I don't think that is a good idea."

"Of course it is, if you don't show up then I will drag you there."

"Okay!" I said quickly, then put my head down and power walked to my world history class. On my way I heard Punzie say to Jack, "Someone has a crush." in a teasing manor.

I blushed, but didn't stop walking until I was in the classroom.

I purposely got bad grades to make Anna look smarter, but I took online classes and aced them. I always informed the teachers and principals about this, and after explaining the poor sob story on of the Queen's they agreed, and only count my online class's grades. I want to make Anna look good, while still being able to get good grades.

The teacher talked in a monotone voice, and kept repeating things that I already knew. This was going to be a long day.

Thank God they started the first day on a Friday, and in the winter! Don't know what that is about, but I'm not complaining.

~Time Skip to the End of the Day~

As expected this school day sucked, especially music class. I love singing, and I am fairly decent too, but Anna wants to be the best at everything. Let me tell you, it is really hard to convincingly sound seriously terrible at singing. Still, I managed to pull it off.
