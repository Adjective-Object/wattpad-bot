Posts will begin 1st of July. As this is being written I will be editing the first Cenzy Sister Novel and I hope you check it out as well. I'm hoping to improve my craft and any and all comments will be deeply appreciated. I am no stranger to constructive criticism.
I'm looking forward to another adventure with Erica, meet new characters, and unfortunately run into some old ones. Death stalks close by in Erica's world so expect the worse. After this book you'll probably hate me, but I do hope I don't disappoint.
I really hope you enjoy this story for all its worth.
