MY SISTER WAS INVOLVED IN THIS TOO.
ANYWAY LETS GET ON WITH IT, SO YESTERDAY WE WENT TO MCDONALDS AND WE WERE DISCUSSING HARRY AND LOUIS.
MY SISTER WAS SAYING LIKE,"WE THINK HARRY IS GAY..." AND THEN THE NOT IMPORTANT THING AND MY MUM WAS LIKE ITS NOT IMPORTANT THAT HARRY SAID IT.
SHE ALSO SAID THAT LOUIS IS PROBABLY THE GAY ONE INSTEAD OF HARRY AND YEAH.
THIS WAS ONE OF MY LIFE EXPERIENCES.
