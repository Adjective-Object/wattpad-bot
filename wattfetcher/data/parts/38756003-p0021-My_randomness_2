hello my Halo's its Angel here with a new thing that I thought I would try. what I have planned is that I will do things and just add 'that moment when' before 'cause I am really tired and so..yeah..
that moment when you are cleaning your porch and you get stabbed with a metal wire and it hurts like crazy when you pull it out and your mom freaks out 'cause your dad brought it in from the garage and could have infected you. true story bro happened today
(1)your taller than your cousin who is almost 8 years older than you.
(2)you have no idea what to do at the end of the 3 hour mark that your cousin and her husband are at your house so it has awkward silence
(3)Sheldon Cooper off of Big Bang Theory has a partner and you don't
(4)you think you are smart then someone has to show you up...........
(5)you dissect a cow eyeball and the inside is creepily pretty..... did that Friday...
(6)a cow trailer goes by and other people are like 'ewwww whats that horrid smell' then theres me mmmmmmmmm the wonderfull smell of country living. I don't have cows but I am perfect around their smell I actually kinda like it.
(7)you have no idea what to type so you just type random things like this fughekjfbhveiufbhvaJHFiro lawl
(8)you have to say either 'don't ask' or ' this is normal for meh bro' to many people because they think there is something wrong with you.
(9)your friend use to be quiet and shy and you think I have created a monster.
(10)your friend use to be quiet and shy and now you are kinda afraid to go up in front of your class.... IT RUBBED OFF ON TO MEH!!!! WHY YOU DO DAT BRO!!!! NAW dun  do dis plzzzz
