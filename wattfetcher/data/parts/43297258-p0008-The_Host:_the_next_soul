"So he fell in love you?" I asked she scoffed
"No he didn't. He's in love with my body. It used to be his girlfriends" she explained the boy rolled his eyes
"That's not true Sunny" he said
"Yeah right" she coughed I laughed
"So he's basically using you" I said and she led me away from the others.
"I think so" she sighed
"Dump his ass" I said she raised an eyebrow. "Leave him"
"I can't it would make him unhappy" she said
"But don't you deserve to be happy?" I asked she went silent and looked down
"Sunny" I heard Kyle say she didn't look up just twisted her head to the other side
"Sunny that's not true" he said she whipped around
"Fine then let's prove it" she said we all looked at her confused
"I've been thinking. If I get taken out if Jody's body then we'll see if you really care about me!!" She said I gave him a smug look
"Yeah let's see" I said
"No Sunny" he said. "I can't loose you"
"Or you can't loose the body she's in" I said
He glared at me
"I just don't want you getting hurt" he said she sighed and smiled
"Okay Kyle" she said
"Sunny!!!!!" I claimed she smiled at me
"Kyle give us a moment" she said he nodded and walked away
I turned to her
"I'm switching" she said.
"What?" I asked
"I lied to him. I never lied. But after what you said I couldn't turn back. I deserve to know what he really thinks" she growled I stared at her she smiled
"Next time they go on a raid I'll tell Jared" she said. "I'll make sure he knows what he's done to me. And if he doesn't love me I'll destroy him"
She smiled at me again and walked away leaving me shocked as I turned away and followed a confused Jared and Melanie
I know that defective souls can turn other souls into defective souls. I had just given Sunny her first taste of violence.
She had started lying to Kyle. She never has. Then she she send she would destroy him.
Destroy him???????
What had I done?
What had I turned her into?
