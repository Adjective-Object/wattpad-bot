Hey guys, I'm deleting this story because I'm making a new one, and just getting all these ideas, and this one just wasn't going to work, so I might just leave it up and put it on hold, then continue when I've done my other story, or I'll just delete and re write this one.
Also, I'm not publishing my other book until it's complete, so it might be a while so here's a little sample/ teaser 🐒🐺
Pain and fire. That's all I could feel, my breaths coming out shallow. I let out a pained scream as I felt my bones break, and mould into another shape. I risked a glance down at my hands, which had disappeared and turned into large paws. Another painful wail later, my nose felt like it was being stretched to an unbelievable length, and my gums were aching like canines were sprouting out. As my spinal cord snapped, i tried to wail and sob, but the sound that came out was a muffled whimper. Confusing myself and forgetting about the pain for a moment, I was jolted back to reality when my ankles swivelled, and reformed themselves backwards. The fire was spreading rapidly throughout my body at an unbelievable rate, as I looked down at my paws, that fur had started to sprout on, then suddenly the pain, fire - everything suddenly stopped. The only feeling remained was tingling, as I felt fur sprouting over my now, non human body. Then when it hit me. I had just become a supernatural creature.
