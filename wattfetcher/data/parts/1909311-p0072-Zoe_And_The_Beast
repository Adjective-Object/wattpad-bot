But I also had to play the role Beast wanted me to play. I had to venture between two different sides, and possibly betray both.
With my brother in my heart, I set my chin at Beast and asked him the one question he wanted to hear. "So when do I start?"

AN// Okay, so tbh, I did NOT mean for it to go in this direction at all. But then I starting thinking to myself, and I really put myself in Zoe's shoes and I realized...I would never not defend my brother, no matter what he did. I mean, obviously my brother isn't a murderer, but no matter what he did, I would always support him, or at least hide his secrets and help him get things sorted out. I mean, I wouldn't support murder, but...you guys get the point.
As dissapointed as Zoe is with Zach, she can't just drop him like that. He's her brother, for Pete's sake. So...I was kinda drunk on Beast while I was writing this and decided to make him a real Beast with this. I also made this a part 2, because I felt like it would be a really bad chapter on its own. :)

Thanks for reading!
P.S. Because you've read so far, and you've been fabulous friends and supporters, there's a picture of Zoe on the side. :) I tried to find a picture that wasn't photoshopped, so...yeah.
