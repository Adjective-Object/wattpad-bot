Sunlight peeks through the curtains. A feeling of warmth seeps through the back of my shirt. A quiet hum of a tune I don't know buzzes close to my ear. I slowly turn, seeing long, dark hair slightly covering a face in need of a shave. Bucky's lips hum out the said foreign song. He pulled back a little, as I turn in his arm, the metal one lazily draped over my hip. He soft lips press gently against my cheek, and my hand locks into his hair.
"We should take a shower," I said, breaking the silent kisses.
He groans before laying his head on my chest and burying us both in the sea of blankets. I wiggle.
"Stop that. Let me love you, woman," Bucky said. I sighed and relaxed into his touch again. The air conditioner kicks on and a breeze blows against my face. I snuggle down as he hums an Ed Sheeran song.

"When your legs don't work like they used to before,""And I can't sweep you off your feet,""Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?""Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?"
