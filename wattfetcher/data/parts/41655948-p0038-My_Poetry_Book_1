The street lights pass overhead, my feet on the dash, your hands on the wheel. We weren't tired, not even the slightest. You drove out of town, to take me to an abandoned barn I must've seen a million times. But I never saw it the way I do now, with you, at midnight. We lay in the grass for awhile, watching as the stars come out to play. You point out a constellation in the sky but the only one I see lies within the magic your eyes.
We don't fall asleep that night, we just talk and stare at the sky some more. I realize I need you, in an aching way that consumes me. You talk about getting a second job so you can pay rent, but that's not what I'm thinking about.
I look at the way your eyes sparkle and think about how even the stars couldn't look so beautiful. Our lips touch but only for a second, before you disappear into the night. It was all too much but never enough.
