"I said you were supposed to cook for me Persephone."he snarled
"I'm sorry I thought you would tell me when you wanted me to cook" I said
"No bitch you have to have dinner ready for me by six o'clock every night""Okay I'm sorry. It won't happen again" I told him
He didn't seem convinced so I turned to walk away. He then grabbed me by the hair and pulled me back. He let go and I turned around to face him. I looked in his eyes and saw anger, then out of nowhere he slaps me and continues to hit me. I fall to the floor and he starts to kick me. Eventually he stops and I try to get up. I crawl onto my hands and knees. I reach up to grab the table to pull myself up and he kicks me in the stomach and leaves the kitchen.
I hear him yell from his room "dinner better be ready soon".
I open the fridge and grab out eggs. I make scrambled eggs for him to eat for dinner. Then I go to his room and knock on the door telling him it's ready. Before he comes out I run to my room and hide in the small crawl space. That night I cried myself to sleep.
