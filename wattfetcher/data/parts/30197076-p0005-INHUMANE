"Happy Birthday, Cupcake." His Husky Voice Whispered Near My Ear, Sending Light Shivers down My Spine.
She Knew She Felt Something Towards him, Hell She Was Sure Of It..But Again, Who Was She To Say If they Were Really Destined Or Not ?
One Thing She Was Sure Of Though, That She LOVES him And Thats The Worst thing About It.
She Loved Him Like A Mate Would Love Her Other Half, Accepted him With All His Flaws And Mistakes Despite Being The Monster He thinks he Is.. After all, A Vampire Couldnt Be Worse Than What Her Siblings Are ?
Just as he Started getting Closer to Her Lips, She Realised What He Was About To Do In Which Resulted in Her Stumbling backwards a Few Steps.
He Might be her Boyfriend, yes. But I Was 15 When We Dated And Well Im Not Just Ready For Things To Get Heated up even if It's just a simple Kiss.
"H-Hey." I Choaked out, My Cheeks Turning Bashful.
I Never actually Confronted him About My Insecurity issues but I Had thought After Couple times That he Got The Message After Several Times Of Similar Situations.
He Sighed Heavily Before Turning Around, Running A Hand Through His Perfectly Tousled Coffee Brown Hair.
No, Something Was Definetly Wrong With Him..
Peeking At Him Secretively, She Could See Him Holding His Temples, Massaging Them Tentively, His Eyes Shut tightly.
Slowly Yet Carefully, She Took Some Steps Towards Him, As She Was Afraid, He Would Burst Into A Rampage Before Placing A Hand Softly on His Shoulders.
Tip-toeing Up A little In An Attempt To Reach His Ears, She Asked Lowly,
"Aiken ?"
Upon Hearing His Name, He Quickly Whirled Around Smiling At her But Looking Into His Eyes , She Knew It Wasnt real..It wasnt His Usual, Breath-taking Beam That Would Make You Melt right Here And There.
She Could Feel Something Bothering Him..
Just as She Opened Her Mouth To Ask Him, He Cut Her Through, Telling Her How He Needed To excuse herself As He Was Not Feeling Well And How Apologetic He Felt That He Wouldnt Be Able To Party The Night With Her But Not Before Promising Her To Take Her Tomorrow Somewhere Nice For Them To Celebrate Alone.
Bidding Her A Peaceful And Good night, He Kissed Her Forehead, His Lips Lingering There For a Moment Before Flashing Away.
As She Stared Into The Distance, She Couldnt Help The quarrel That Took Place Between Her Heart And Mind.
Her Heart Telling Her To Follow Him, To Comfort Him And Assure Him That She Would Be There For Him No matter The Consequences.
However, Her Mind, Wisefully, Told Her Otherwise.
Maybe, He Needs Space. Or Maybe He Felt Overwhelmed By all The Blasting Music And People Around Him, But She Knew Better Than To Believe That.
Admitting the fact That The Moment He Told Her He Would Not Be Spending The Night Partying With Her, She Felt Like Her Heart Was Stabbed And Her Mind Ragged With Questions.
Shaking Her Head, In An Attempt To Kick all The Negative Possibilities Away, She Turned Around, Deciding To Get Over Herself And Continue The Night..Without Him.

"INCOMING !!" A Voice Shouted, Followed By A Feminine Voice Giggling Sweetly.
Instantly, All The People Pushed themselves Away, Parting In Both Directions like The Red Sea.
