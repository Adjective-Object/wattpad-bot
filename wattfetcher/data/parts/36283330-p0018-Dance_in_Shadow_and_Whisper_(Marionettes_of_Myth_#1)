When they finally uttered their sweet goodbyes and shoved off, the gym had emptied. Jason was gone, and so was Yuuhi.
Shit.
I hadnâ€™t pegged Yuuhi as the type to trick or take advantage of me, but if he went after Jason and got to him before Jason had a chance to step inside the sanctuary of his house, I was totally, royally screwed.
I raced to where my backpack sat, abandoned and lonely, and threw it onto my shoulder before I made for the doors. I would have beaten the group of meandering boys, but a shiver up my spine stopped me cold. There and gone in a heartbeat, a whiff of ill intentions stung my sinuses and raised the alarm in my mind. I checked first over my shoulder, scanning the empty gym, allowing the boys to exit through the doors first.
That was a mistake.
I whipped back around, took half a step, and then I saw Yuuhi there in front of the doors as they fell shut. His hand held a ring of keys, one of which he had stabbed into the panel control of the gym lights. The other hand held a sleek black handgun, raised, and aimed right at me with his trigger finger curled.
I got a good look of the stark seriousness in his eyes before his key hand twisted, and all the lights in the gym switched off.
