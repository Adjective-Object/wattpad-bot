we go down the hall and are about to get on the elevator.
"wait cameron stop!" i say. i jump off his back and he turns around,"whats wrong?" he says. "um....i forgot something, ill meet yall downstairs" i say. "want me to go with ya?" he says.
"no im fine" i say smiling. "okay" he smiles back and kisses my cheek. i blush. he winks.
once they get in the elevator and it closes, i wait like 30 seconds and then go downstairs.
i am terrified of elevators. i never will get on one, they are too scary, the first time i got on one me and tristen got stuck for like 5 hours.
i see the door to the lobby and go through it. they all have their backs to me so i sneak up behind cam and poke his sides.
"AHH!" he yells. i bust out laughing. "that wasnt funny!" he says. "maybe not to you, but to me it was" i say laughing. he laughs.
"hey are yall done flirting or no, because im starving, and want to leave" matthew says. cameron rolls his eyes. i blush.
we get in the van and we head to i hop.__________________we walk in and spot bart with, LEIGH! what the fuck is she doing here?!
we walk over there and sit down. we talk and bart explains to us, about the events, the prices, and merch.

after we ate bart said we could explore dallas, so we all went to a park and were just sitting in a beautiful field, talking, laughing, and making vines.
then my phone starts ringing, i look at the ID and its my home phone.
