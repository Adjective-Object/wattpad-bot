Couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry."

Alright for starters, I need to explain what this book will include and a summary of it so you understand.

So basically, Nick becomes obsessed with a girl named Lux.  It's not the kind of obsession where you try to talk to them a lot and take the occasional few pictures of them.  This obsession includes stalking, following, murdering, even breaking into the victim's home.

This story will include:
-Violence
-Rape
-Sexual content
-Murder
-Language

If you are uncomfortable with reading any of the following above, I suggest you do not read this story.

I also suggest you are over the age of thirteen.  Although I do understand if you are younger, some people have more mature minds.
