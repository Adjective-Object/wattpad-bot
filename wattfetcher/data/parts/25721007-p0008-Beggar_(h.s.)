But I don't.
Yeah you do. My conscious added and I ignored it.
I just don't get Harry at all. One moment he saves me from being hurt and another he kisses me, but then he continues to call me things and gives me odd looks and yells at me. I'm not sure how to feel about him.
It's been an hour since they all left. I've been sitting on the couch in the living room for the same amount of time. Someone jiggled the front door handle and appeared Harry.
"Um.. They want to know if you want to join them for lunch," he looked around the room awkwardly like he's never been here before.
"No. I'm okay," I spoke.
"Why not?" He started to look.. upset?
"I'm just not in the mood," I shrugged my shoulders.
"Just come, I.. They all want you too,"
"Where you the one giving me food everyday?" I asked changing the subject.
"I might answer that if you come with," he sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Deal," I agreed and followed him out the door.

"So, Lennon.. How did you become homeless anyway?" Niall asked. And all boys, even Harry, listened.
I sighed and began. I told them about the car crash, about the foster home, the running away, McDonalds, getting fired, and then living on the streets. Every one frowned, even Harry.
"No one should have to live like that," Harry whispered so soft that I almost didn't hear it. Did he actually feel bad for me?
I think that kiss this morning was a good thing. He seems so much nicer and he's in a better mood then before.
"Yeah, but now I have you guys," I smiled and they all did too, except curly hair in the corner of the booth.
"You should apply to a college. Live your dream again. You'd be a hot college student," Zayn winked and gave Harry a smirk. He clenched his fists onto his lap. There seemed to be tension between the two.
"I might next year," I shrugged.
"What do you wanna do?"
"I want to be a photographer. I always did,"
"Maybe you could photograph me sometime," Zayn smirked again, Harry looked pissed.
"I'm not planning to take portraits of people," I laughed, "And plus I don't have a camera anyway."
The conversation ended there when our food arrived. They all got burgers and fries. I got a grilled cheese sandwich that I finished quickly.

I've been laying on the couch for thirty minutes now and I can't sleep for some reason. All of the guys went out to a bar except Harry.
I'm deciding if I should ask to lay with him or not. He was being pretty nice today, but he could quickly turn back to his old self and laugh in my face.
Before I knew it, my feet were dragging me to his bedroom door. I knocked.
"Come in,"
"Sorry to wake you, I just can't sleep out there," I looked away prepared for what rude comment he has in store for me.
"Well, if it makes you feel any better,  you can sleep in my bed again," he patted down next to him and I walked over.
