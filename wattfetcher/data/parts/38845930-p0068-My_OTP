Jordan's POV
After breakfast, I ran out to the po box to see what was there because I hadn't been there for a while, also to check Erin's because its the same po box for both of us.
"Erin! Erin!" I screamed when got back.
"What happened!? What!? Are you okay?" She asked as she ran from the bedroom to me.
"I'm fine, look at this." I said.
"Happy for you guy, blah blah blah... here we go, here's a few things I got for you as a... " She mumbled.
"Erin?" I asked because she just stared at it.
"Please... hmm hmm, blah blah." She said.
"Do you see this?" I asked. She gave me a side hug still reading the note. "Are you done reading yet?" I asked.
"Aww, Jordan. Open the box." She said once she finally finished reading.
"Isn't that cute? Are we okay now?" I asked.
"I think we are okay. I think we're at least there." She said.
"Yeah, I'm cool with that." I said as she opened the box.
"Put it on." She said putting one of the rings a viewer made us on my finger.
"Put yours on." I said.
"I won't ever take this off." She said, she put it on and kissed me making me smile.
"I guess we are better now." I said.
"We're pretty cool." She said before kissing me again.
"Yeah?" I asked grabbing her, holding her closer and throwing the box onto the couch.
"Yeah." She said pulling her hair to one side and kissing me yet again. "I love you." She said.
"I love you." I said.
"I know." She said holding her hand over mine on her hip.
"Good." I said.
"I really wish I had called." She said.
"I... know you do, I wish you did too." I said.
"I still miss you." She said.
"I love you, don't not call again... please." I said as she put her head on my shoulder.
"I love you." She said.
We stood there hugging for a while until she squeezed me, took me by my shoulders and I took her by her waist, we stood there and looked at each other... and she eventually lied her head on my chest.
"Are you tired of standing or is it just me?" I asked, no response. "Erin?" I asked, once again no response. "Are you sleeping standing up?" I asked. "Erin?" I asked again this time pushing her off me.
"Hmm?" She asked.
"Were you sleeping?" I asked.
"Half asleep." She said.
"Ha ha, really?" I asked.
"Maybe." She laughed.
"That's so cute." I said.
"Oh, Jordan." She said.
"Want to go lay down?" I asked.
"Mmm hmm." She said putting her head back down.
We lied down and she just stayed in my arms, I missed her so much.
"I missed you." I said.
