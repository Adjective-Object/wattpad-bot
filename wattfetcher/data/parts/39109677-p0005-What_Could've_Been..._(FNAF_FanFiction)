I threw my head down again. Back to rejection. I sighed, having a sort of friend had been nice, even if it had only been for one period.
My oddly colored hair fell over my eyes again as I made my way to first period.
I waded through the hallway, stopping at room 201. English. Luckily, the door was open, and I stepped in.
The seating arrangements were the same in this class, safe for one thing. In the back of my homeroom, it was just my desk and the one to the left of it; a little pair. In this room, it was a little row of three, with my desk in the middle.
I sat down at the lonesome threesome, but refrained from making my wall, it was usually only okay to put it up in homeroom.Â  The other students filed in, shooting me disgusted looks as they sat down. They've all probably heard about it by now...
Class started, and Mr. Rodriguez stepped to the front of the classroom and announced that there would be two new students this period. But until they arrived we were assigned to work in groups on our notes on Conjunctional Verbs.
(A/N): Is that a thing?
Ten minutes into class, ten minutes into me working alone, again, the new students were introduced. They were twins, one clad in brown, the other in gold.
Freddy, as the brown-clad one was introduced, had light brown hair, blue eyes, and wore a pristine white T-shirt under a brown hoodie. He wore brown dress pants and black dress shoes.
Gannon, or "Goldie," as he said he liked to be called, had longer, golden hair, hazel eyes speckled with gold, and wore the same white shirt, a golden hoodie, and had on gold dress pants. His shoes were the same as Freddy's.
I sighed, the only empty seats in the room were the ones on either side of me. Great. More new people. Seemingly knowing where they were supposed to go, the twins nodded simultaneously at Mr. Rodriguez and set of towards me.
Goldie sat on my left and Freddy on my right...I'm trapped...
Freddy and Goldie...It rhymes...I was snapped out of my thoughts by the teacher, "Now, Proxis, I know that you usually work and sit alone, but try to get along with the new students, okay? If you have problems later I can move the desks to somewhere else, but for now I want you to try, okay?" I nodded, and Mr. Rodriguez chuckled slightly, like the other teachers, he assumed my so called "Vow of Silence" Was a dare or something, not a real problem induced by emotional trauma. Well I'm glad I amuse you!
"So, lovely miss, what's your name?" Goldie politely asked me. Why do people keep talking to me? I. Won't. Respond. I don't want this...I don't want friends... I listened to my thoughts and kept on working, ignoring his question.
"Forgive my brother if he was rude or unpleasant in any sort of way," Freddy replied to my silence, "I, however am more of a gentleman, so let me rephrase his oh-so-rude question, Lovely miss, I am humbled in your presence. I am not worthy of knowing one with such elegance and grace as you. But I respectfully ask-NO! Beg to know the name of my goddess. At least in that way, I may know what to call the one I worship."
I rolled my eyes, and Goldie snickered at his brother, he had obviously seen my response. I turned to a clean page on my notebook,(which I had been using to refine my notes) and wrote down:

I don't talk, I've chosen not to. My name, which you so DRAMATICALLY asked for Freddy, is PROXIS. Pronounced Prah- as in the pr sound from practice and the ahh sound from lock. X, as in add an x to Prah, so it now resembles Proximity's first syllable. And then isss, as in hisssss, like a snake. Pr-Ox-Isss, Proxis.
