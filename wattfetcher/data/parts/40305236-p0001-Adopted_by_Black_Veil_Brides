Hey, I'm Infinity ( A/N picture of Infinity above) and I am 15 years old. I'm not the most "normal" person you will ever meet as my music taste goes from the Disney sound track to bands like Black Veil Brides and Blink-182. I have an unhealthy obsession with pizza, music, sleep and the Internet, oh yeah I'm also an orphan (A/N okay I'm laughing really hard right now because I wrote organ instead of orphan and now I'm imagining a big bundle of Organ's walking around like "sup") my parents died when I was 5, my mum died from a fatal car accident, my dad turned to drugs and alcohol then finally died of an overdose 1 year later; but not before leaving scars with many stories behind on me. I was taken to an orphanage and things weren't much better there, let's just say I'm not the most well liked person here but at least I'm not some plastic Barbie doll. I also sing a small bit and play the drums, bass, guitar and piano. That's it for now and I'll talk to you laterzzzz. {A/N those four unnecessary Z's tho ;)},~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~<~>~>~<~<~<~<
