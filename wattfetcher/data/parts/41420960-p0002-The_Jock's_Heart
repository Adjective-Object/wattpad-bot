I lean against the door and slide down until I hit the floor. I bring my knees up to my face and I just let out the sobs. I can't keep it in anymore.
How could people actually believe that I would lie about something so big? Plus it was a horrible rumor, isn't it always that everyone believes rumors and you don't want them to because it's not true? For me it was the opposite. My secret spilled and it turned into a rumor. In a way, I am I little glad that no one believed it, but I didn't expect anyone to think I just went around telling people that so that I could get attention.
It's my fault, I should've never told anyone about what my parents did in the first place.
Not even the teachers believed me though. If I were a teacher, and I heard about a student who had troubles at home, you sure as hell better know that I'm coming after you to comfort you.
When my teachers heard about my parents hurting me, none of them believed me, along with all of my classmates.
I remember my friends and I were having a sleepover and my mom came into the room to say something. She left and all my friends said she was so nice and caring. I couldn't help but tell them how she actually was, and they didn't believe me. When they left my house that morning, they all got so mad at me, because they thought I was lying for attention.
The next day at school, it was a hot topic and that was when all of the tormenting started. Ever since then, everybody has called me an attention whore, a slut and God knows where the hell they even got that, and many many things worse.
You'd think they'd all be more comforting, after they just found out that I've been abused by my parents for the past ten years. That was three years ago, and everyone has bullied me since.
So now, I have absolutely no one in my life.
But yet, I'm still here.
