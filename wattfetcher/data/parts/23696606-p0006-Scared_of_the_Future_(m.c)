I don't know why, but the drive to Michael's place was slightly awkward. Ashton drove, I sat in the back and Michael rode shotgun. Ashton would look over at Michael ever so often, Michael would look at me through the rear-view mirror, and I'd look out the window.
Something happened back there between Michael and Ashton, I'm sure of it. I pulled the blanket closer to my body, still freezing. My head was aching, and I was starting to feel nauseous. "How long is it left?" I weakly asked, trying not to move to much. "Not long, maybe a couple of minutes, nothing more." Michael said soothingly, calming me slightly. Ashton grabbed the wheel tighter, his knuckles showing through his skin.
I don't understand what was up with him. Ever since we shook hands, he's been acting weird. Maybe he got that weird feeling too? It doesen't matter. Thinking too much made my head hurt even more.
I felt the car turn into a driveway and coming to a stop. Michael and Ashton undid their seatbelts and exited the car, but I stayed put. I couldn't move. Everything hurt. Michael seemed to notice the lack of my presence, as he turned around and walked back towards the car.
He opened the door and undid my seatbelt as well. He also seemed to notice how horrible I felt, so he frowned and scooped me up in his arms. "It's OK, you'll get better once we get inside." he assured me, walking up the stone steps to his house. Ashton stood there waiting. "Everything OK?" he asked, with a slightly worried look on his face. "Yeah, just feel a little sick." I smiled at him, holding onto the blanket.
As we entered the house, a sense of relief hit me hard. Without bothering to take his shoes off, Michael carried me into what looked like the living-room. He gently put me down on the couch before grabbing another blanket and laying it over me. "I'll go get you some dry clothes to borrow, and then make a cup of warm tea. Alright?" he stroke my cheek, pushing a strand of hair out of my face. "Thank you" I weakly answered before digging deeper into the blankets. Michael got up and walked out of the room.
I had almost dozed off when he came back a few minutes later with clothes in his hands and Ashton following him. "The bathroom is in the hallway, third door to the left. There are some towels on a rack if you need it." I nodded and smiled gratefully at them before getting up, taking the clothes and walking to the bathroom.

Michael's P.O.V

When Lilith was gone, Ashton and I walked into the kitchen. I started heating the cooking plate, and got a kettle out of the cupboard, "So what's the plan?" Ashton asked, leaning on the doorframe. I stayed quiet and walked to the fridge, where I kept water bottles. I took one out and shut the fridge door. I held it up so he could see, and walked back to the stove, pouring the water into the kettle. Ashton made that 'not bad' face before saying; "Holy water. Nice one."
As he walked into the kitchen, the water started boiling. I sighed and grabbed a mug out of the cabinet. I went to the cupboard once again and pulled out a bag of peach tea. Ashton poured some water into the cup, and I put in the teabag. I tasted the drink, making sure it was sweet enough. It was. And so we went into the living-room to wait for Lilith.

Lilith's P.O.V

I stood in front og the bathroom sink, looking at myself in the mirror. My wet clothes was now laying in a pile on the floor, and I was wearing a black 'Misfits' sweater and grey sweatpants with legs so long I had to roll the legs up. The shirt was way to big for me, and almost reached to my knees. I huffed and took a hairband from my wrist and put my hair into a ponytail. I'm lucky I don't wear makeup, because it would've been smudged all over my face.
