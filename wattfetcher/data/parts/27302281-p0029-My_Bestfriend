"Ok " she said
" here let me" I said unbuckling her seatbelt then mine and hopping out the car to open her door and grabbing her hand as she got out  and she smiled at me  and I returned the smile then we  walked onto the porch and stopped at the door and I turned to her
"  ready baby " I said
" yeah let's do it " she said nervously
I knocked on the door and waited a few minutes  then knocked again  then I heard footsteps and   locks being unlocked and then I was greeted by my mom with a wide smile on her face
"Justin " she said attacking me in a hug
" hey mom " I said wrapping my arms around her
" I missed you soo much so who is this beautiful young lady " she said  referring to kylie who had now been hiding in my neck
" don't Worry dear I don't bite "   she said smiling at kylie who moved away from me and stood there awkwardly
" uh mom this is Kylie my girlfriend " I said added to the awkwardness
"Kylie I hardly recognized her but the girlfriend part is new "  she said giving kylie a warm smile
" hello Mrs  Mallette "  she said confidentiality
"  hello dear wanna come inside its a little chilly today with the wind and all"  my mom asked her and she just nodded
Kylie started walking in with my mother and I just followed in close behind   and walked into the living room to see my little brother and sister and the person I never thought I would see in a million years ... My father
" justy" Jassy yells running up to me and wrapping her arms around my leg
" justin " Jaxon yelled looking up from his toys and running over to me and hugging my other leg then I bent down to there size and Jassy hugged me around my neck
" justy I missed you " Jassy squealed
" I missed you too Jassy "   I replied kissing her forehead
" what about me did you miss me " Jaxon said looking at his feet
" well yes now get over here" I said picking him up as he walked over to me  then he hugged my neck  then I set him down and looked at my father
" hello justin" my father said and I just nodded then walked off
Well that was rude
And.. he left us
So he's trying to make up for it
Man my conscious has been extremely bossy today
" listen justin I'm .." My said started to say but I cut him off
" save it  " I said storming away from him
