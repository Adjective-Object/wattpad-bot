The boys stare at one another. This girl's demeanor was almost... intimidating. Honestly, it looked as if she didn't belong in this school.
"Uh, yeah," Calum speaks up. "We're new. But the question is what the hell are you doing in a place like this? No offense, but you don't exactly...fit in with the scenery around here."
The girl lets out a laugh and folds her arms. "Wrong again. See, the thing is, I actually fit perfectly into this school. You four on the other hand, not so much."
"What makes you say that?" Ashton shoots back, crossing his arms as well.
The girl cocks her eyebrow. "Do you smoke?"
They all shake their heads.
"Have you tried any drugs? Meth? Cocaine? Ecstasy?"
Again, they shake their heads.
"Are any of you drug dealers, alcoholics or members of a gang?"
They shake their heads a third time.
The girl smirks. "Then you definitely don't belong here." She takes a step toward Calum. "Except for you, maybe. You look like a real asshole. What's your name?"
"Calum." He says coolly, removing his shades. "And yours?"
"Avery." She smirks again.
"Badass." Michael and Calum say.
"Yeah, well, you should meet my friend Lace. I'm not someone to mess with, and neither is she." Avery remarks, stepping away from Calum.
Michael's blood runs cold. Did she just...
"Avery!" A tall, bald man peeks his head out of the nearest classroom door. "Get to class!"
"Piss off, Schaffer," Avery mutters, pulling out a cigarette. She lights it up and gives the boys a look. "Any other questions?"
"Yeah, which way toward the Admissions office?" Luke asks. "Down the hall and make a left. First door." She says, turning on her heel.
"Oh, and one more thing!" Calum shouts to her. She turns around and glares at him. "What's your number?" He smirks.
Avery grins. "It's 615 go fuck yourself." She snickers before turning around to head down another hallway.
Calum turns around, his eyes wide with shock. "Well she seems nice."
Michael shakes his head. "Wait, Avery!"
He hears a grunt before Avery's head appears from behind the wall. "What more could you four idiots possible want from me?"
"What does your friend look like?" Michael asks.
Avery chuckles. "Trust me, you'll know when you see her."
