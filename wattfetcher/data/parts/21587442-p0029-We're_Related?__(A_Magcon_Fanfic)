Ashley's Pov
"I have some news for you Ashley, you are paralyzed from the waist down."  The doctor said the horrible news.  I can't believe I'm paralyzed.  I tried moving my legs to see if it was just some prank but I couldn't move them.  My eyes filled with tears.
"It's gonna be ok."  Matthew said, holding onto my hand.
"The good news is that you have options.  There are two ways to get your ability to walk once again.  The first option is simple.  Come in to the hospital three times a week for therapy and after 8-12 months you should have your ability to walk once again.  Or, you could go through surgery.  The only problem is that if you undergo surgery, there is a 50-50 chance that the procedure will not work and you will be paralyzed for the rest of your life.  I'll let you talk to your family about it and when you have a final answer, tap this buzzer and I'll come back to your room as soon as possible."  The doctor said before leaving the room.
"Well, what do you want to do?"  Nash asked.
"I want to do the surgery, but I'm just afraid that the procedure won't work and I won't be able to walk again."  I whisper.
"Why don't you sleep on it and in the morning, you, mom and I can decide."  Nash suggested.
"Ok."  I say.  Cam and Matt went back to their bed, and Nash went to turn off the lights.
"Night guys."  Cam said before Nash turned off the lights.  We all said goodnight before the lights were out.  As soon as I closed my eyes, I fell into a deep, peaceful slumber
