" get in the car your being childish " she cried out  getting out the car
" I'm being childish what about you " I yelled  turning around
" me " she scoffed
" yes you now leave me be "  I yelled out

" justin " she called out
" what " I said
" can I get the keys " she asked
That broke my heart in two she didn't care that I was  out in the rain or pissed off she was gonna leave me here ...
" here" I said tossing the keys

And with that she drove off leaving me in the dust
