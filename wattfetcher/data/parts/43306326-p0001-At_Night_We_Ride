Little people is what we call babies in my world.
As they mature into older humans they grow into finding out what their destiny and civilization groups are. Some are even lucky to be presented the crowning of the leader and others are just part of that civilization.
Not me though. Ever since little I always was the separated duckling of the group. The one whose feathers hadn't grown in yet to be part of civilization or society. I was always so separated and scared what humans would think of me, or if I would turn into the embarrassment of my family.
As I roamed through the Forest of Secrets a small flash sparked my eye. I slowly moved in closer to where the light was coming from.
A strong pull suddenly brought me inward to a small bush right on the side of me. I fell right next to a shoe and looked up as I laid there like a fool.
"Elijah your feet stink," I said as each muscle in my body brought me up.
"Shhhh they'll find us," he said holding my mouth softly.
"Who?" I said as I pushed his hand away.
"The Secret Forest Soldiers," he said, almost inaudible.
"You really believe in that myth?"
"Myth? Cam, this is no myth," he replied.
"Uh Cam this is no myth," I said in a mimicking way.
"Cam you have no true imagination whatsoever..."
"And you have no brain Elijah," I replied.
"Camilla, Elijah, where are you two?" said a distant voice.
"Here mother," I replied as I pushed my brother into the bush.
At dinner table something felt a bit odd. Dad was silent and mom kept playing with her fried broccoli. I just sat there looking down at my hands with no expression at all. My brother though, broke the silence and said," Dad is everything fine?"
My dad just sighed and said," Please excuse me," and he was off. Just my mom, brother, and me were left there.
