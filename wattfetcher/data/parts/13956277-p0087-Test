"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOOUU HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAY TOOOO YOOOOOUUUU" My eyes widened as I saw al my friends inside the house standing around a table with a huge cake over it.
"Happy birthday Leena" Simon whispered as he gave me a box wrapped with red paper and a bow.
"Wh-what is this ?" I asked in a whisper, "It's your birthday, 21st of October" Elina hugged me so did the other girs, I was too shocked to say anything, I stood in my place with two of Simons' gift, I wore one and held the other.
"Don't you say you forgot about it ?" Tom asked and I started tearing, "W-what's wrong ? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you" Simon apologized.
"No, No, I'm happy, really happy. It's just that I wish my parents were here, I can't believe they forgot my birthday" Simon gave me some tissues, "Are you actually crying ? You've got to be kidding me ! come on !" Damon started jumping and doing weird faces to cheer me up and I eventually laughed.
I heard some nasheed playing in the background, "Is this Sami Yusuf's nasheed?" I asked, "You can say that I searched about somethings in your phone" Diana said, "WHAT ?what else did you find ?" I glared at her, "This" She pointed at the cake and I saw a picture of me when I was a baby and a recent one printed on top of the cake, "Thank you, everybody, I really appreciate this" I hugged my friends, "Come on ! I deserve a hug too ! I chose the flavor of the cake !" Peter said and we all laughed.
"So, me and the guys will go out to let you and the ladies have fun and some privacy" Simon pulled the boys out, "Leena" Damon called, "Yes ?" I asked, "You said that your parents forgot your birthday. They actually did not" He smiled, "What ?", "Your gift is outside" Damon opened the door widely and my eyes lied on a golden Range rover with a red bow on top of it, I screamed my lungs out.
"You've got to be kidding me" I jumped up and down after Damon gave me the keys, "You sure my parents sent that ? We are not that rich neither are my parents that generous" I asked, "No offence but I asked your father the same question. He scolded me and shouted at me since it's none of my business but he told me that his things worked out well in Turkey and he has built a new company, he also mentioned how muck he loves you and that will give you the whole world if he can. Congratulations, you are rich now"
Me and the girls decided to play truth and dare, "Leena, who bought you this beautiful dress ?" Molley asked, I glared at her because she knew the answer but wanted to embarrass me, "It's a gift from Simon" The girls gasped except Helen, "I ain't surprised if he eventually falls in love with Leena, I mean, after all, he did this whole thing and planned for it, he even did the decoration by himself and invited us yesterday, he even told us to steal your phone and find out your taste in music" Helen said, Molly coughed "With my help for sure and my taste" I blushed, "Did he really do this for me ?" I asked, "LEENA IS BLUSHING, SHE FEELS SOMETHING FOR SIMON" Molly shouted, "WHAT ! no shut up, it's just ..... it's just that nobody has done something nice for me since I came" I frowned, "Says the girl with a golden Range rover" Helen said sarcastically. A phone ringed and cut off out conversation, "Whose phone is this?" We all asked in sync. I took the phone and unlocked it, "Whose phone is this ?" I asked again after I was surprised because of the background that had some Arabic words, لا اله الا الله (la elaha ella allah , No god except Allah) was written in a bold font, "WHOSE PHONE IS THIS !" I asked loudly, "What's wrong ?" Diana stood up to see what's wrong with the phone but I put it behind my back, "Nothing".
The door opened after two minutes while I was still holding the phone and wondering about the owner of it, "Oh, you found my phone, thank you" Tom snapped the phone from my hand, "Do you realize what's written on the picture that is set as your phone background ?" I asked.
