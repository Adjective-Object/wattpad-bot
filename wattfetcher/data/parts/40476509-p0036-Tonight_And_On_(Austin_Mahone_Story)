Mom: You were in a car accident and a coma for 6 days and you didn't even bother to tell me?!
Amanda: Did you tell her Austin?
Me: Yeah but I thought she knew.
She sighed and put her hands on her face.
Amanda: I didn't want her to know about that!
Me: Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom: Don't be sorry Austin, you did the right thing. I'm glad you told me. Amanda, why didn't you want me to know about this?
Amanda: Be I didn't want to worry you guys or anything.
Mom: What would've happened if you didn't wake up out of that coma?
Amanda: I don't know. Austin would've probably gotten on my phone and called you.
Mom: (*didn't say anything*)
They started to argued and I just got annoyed with it.
