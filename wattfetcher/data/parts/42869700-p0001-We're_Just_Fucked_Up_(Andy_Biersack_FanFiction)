Song: Problem By Natalie Kills------------------------------------Ugh, another day in hell YAY! Well new hell I just moved to LA with my best friend Aribella but prefers Bella.She's the only person that knows what I am. I know what your thinking but what about your parents. I dont have any they died when I was a baby and ive had to figure everything out on my own which aint all that bad. Im basically wild I dont feed off of animals I feed off of humans occasionally animals but not always, but it aint my fault no ones taught me how to hold back. Bella has a boyfriend she's not a vampire either which is fine with me. I have long black hair thats naturally wavy, lip, nose, belly button pierced tattoo sleeve, some on my stomach and leg and a few on my other arm (pic on the side but btw she doesnt have gauges but she has a few piercings on her ear!)
