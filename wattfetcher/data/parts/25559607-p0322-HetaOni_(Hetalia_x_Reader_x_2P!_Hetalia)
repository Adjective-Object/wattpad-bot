"Hello, Germany." I greeted back, then peered over at the uncharacteristically quiet American. "Hey...America...are you okay now?"



"...Huh? W-Well...yeah... Thanks for asking, dudette." he gave a small smile.



The three then exited the bathroom and headed over to where the others were, leaving me to proceed with my own activities. I went over to the far left cubicle and locked the door.

"Uwaa....This is actually really, really, relaxing...." I said to myself, as I was enjoying myself in the tub. I splashed water on my face to get a refreshing feeling from the cool liquid. I've been in here for quite a while now, but as far as I remember, this time's supposed to be sort of a break for everyone...so they hopefully won't mind me relaxing a bit here.



Several minutes later, I felt like my fingers were starting to get pruny, so I decided it was time to get out of the tub. I dried myself off with one towel and wrapped another one around my body. Walking over to my bag that was settled on the dry floor, I searched for new clothes. I picked a (f/c) hoodie and denim pants.


"Huh? Hold on...where's my--"


Before I could finish my sentence, or even put on my new set of clothes, I heard a knock on the door.





"Uhmm...yeah? What is it?" I asked, readjusting my towel nervously. If this was the BTT about to pull a prank on me or something, I swear...



After a moment, the person on the other side of the door spoke softly, "O-Oh, uhm...(Name)? Sorry to bother you...but Kumakichi here told me that your phone had been buzzing for quite a while..."



That voice...Canada? Err, who's Kumakichi? .....



OH.



I placed my new set of clothes on top of my bag and darted for the door. "Kumajiro???" I exclaimed as I opened the door and saw Canada holding a big fluffy polar bear.
