My pov: (i guess since im the character soo yeah)
"Alley . Alley . Alley . Alle-" I started chanting over and over. (Actually do that all the time XD)
"What!" she screamed.
"Im bored." I said
"Really. You did that because you were fucking bored! I hate you." She said.
"You know you love me." I said and hugged her.
"Cousin  im hungry!" Gali yelled.
"Me too!" Alley whined.
"Fine lets go make pizza!!!" I yelled and ran into the kitchen.
"You really love pizza." Alley said as she sat on my counter.
"Pizza. Is. Life." I said. Im in love with pizza! Dont judge me. Its good.
"Anyways.....what are we doing this weekend?" Alley  asked.
"We could drive to that new carnival." Gali  suggested. (In the story were 16)
"Yas!" I yelled after I ordered the pizza.
"Its a plan then." Alley  said.
"Isnt it weird that this carnival randomly shows up though?" Gali asked.
"Oh my god! Its probably Laughing Jacks carnival and were all gonna die!" I fake gasped in horror then me and Alley  started laughing.
"What if it is!" Galii cried. We might read creepypasta a little too mudh. Just kidding! You can never read too much! Ok im not a fangirl (there just creepy) but I do love creepy pasta.
"Calm down Gali, nothing will happen and if it is well just give him Alley  and run." I said. We alway sacrifice Alley .
"Hey!" She yelled and smacked me.
"Ow!" I pouted. That shit hurts. She may be small but damn that bitch smacks hard
"Were just kidding." Gali said.
"Sure." I said just to tease Alley.
"So have you two asked your parents about it yet?" Galii asked. When me and alley met Alley  and I noticed that we have the same clear white eyes - we told eachother contacts- and the same blue hair - we told eachother hair dye-. After that we noticed alot of other things that made us look like siblings. Of course we have different parents though. We were really confused.So we were going to ask our parents if we couldve been adopted.
"No I just dont know if I can ask." Alley said.
"I cant either." I admitted. Then the door bell rang.
"Pizza!" I screamed and they both laughed. We opened the door to find two pizza boys.
"I didnt order that much pizza." I whispered. They both had there hats down so I couldnt see there faces.
"Gimme. gimme. gimme." I said and jumped up and down.
"Sorry she really likes pizza." Gali said and slapped me.
"Its okay." One of the boys laughed out.
"$20" the other boy said. Gali gave them the money and said goodbye.
"Food!" I screamed. Maybe a little too loud because we all heard there laughter again.
"Oops" I said and we laughed. We ate the pizza while watching 21 jump street. (Channing tatum is bae!)
