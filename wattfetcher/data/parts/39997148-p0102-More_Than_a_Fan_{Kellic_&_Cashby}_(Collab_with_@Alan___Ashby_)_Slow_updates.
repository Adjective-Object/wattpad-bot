"I don't want some dick like you talking to my boyfriend." I said and grabbed Austin's hand.
"Wow you actually got with him?" He said looking at Austin.
"Of course I did." He scoffed.
"I don't know why... He seems a little young for you. All he'd be good for is well... nothing."
"Well he's better than you ever were." Austin said.
"Doubt it."
"Oh trust me." He said, "I think it's time for you to go."
He rolled his eyes and glared at me, "He's just using you. Don't forget that." He said and left the building altogether.
"What was he talking about?"
"Nothing, he's not talking about anything." Austin said gripping my hand tighter.
"Well what does he mean? Are you just using me?"
"No I'm not just using you." He said pulling me from the building. "He's just trying to mess with you don't listen to his shit."
"Well then why would you say something like that at all? Did you use Jaxin?"
"What?! No!" He said, "If anything he used me! You saw how he treated me last time we got together."
"I know but you were on and off with him a lot Austin."
"I promise you I am not just using you. Don't worry about it okay?"
"Have you ever used anyone? Like ever?"
"No, I've never used anyone." He said, "I swear."
"Okay." I said leaning up and giving him a kiss, "Let's get to the bus."
"Sounds good to me." He said and wrapped his arm around me. I smiled at him and walked with him to the bus but he stopped, "I'm gonna go say hi to a few fans I'll be on in like fifteen minutes."
I nodded and leaned up kissing him softly, "See you then." I said before leaving his side and to the bus. I got on and put my camera stuff away before getting in my sweats and climbing into bed. I was so tired before I knew it I was fast asleep.
Later waking up to Austin getting in beside me and holding me close, "Goodnight baby." He said and I felt him kiss my lips softly. I cuddled closer to him before falling back to sleep.
Kellin's POV
That's it, I hate the merch employees. I am going to kill each and every single one of them.
"Stop!" I shouted at one of them, "Don't mix the shirts!"
"I'm not!" She snapped and I rolled my eyes snatching the two different shirts from her.
"This one is a medium, this one is an extra large! They don't mix! You're so lucky this show is over or this would have all went down hill!" I shouted, "Now start packing away the bracelets in the boxes I'll do the shirts."
"Alright jeez fucking asshole." She muttered and started putting the bracelets away.
"Watch it or I'll fucking fire your ass."
"You can't-"
"Watch me." I said glaring at her.
"Just shut up Marcie, Kellin's in charge for a reason and I doubt he cares if you're Jaime's cousin. None of us fucking care." Josh snapped sounding completely annoyed.
She rolled her eyes but kept quiet and went on with packing away bracelets.
