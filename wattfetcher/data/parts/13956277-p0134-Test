Be aware of those little simple sins because they lead you to the big ones.
And now what ?
Sometimes you hit that point where your eyes become dry with no tears left,I was lying on the ground with terrible headache hitting my head from inside and outside.
I heard a knock on the door, but didn't bother myself and get up, "Leena, it's me Jake, open up, I got a surprise for you, I brought some chocolate and movies-" But he was cut off by another person and I heard a fight but didn't glance at what was going outside my door. I didn't care, why would I care about someone who only wants to have fun and touch me from head to toe?
I kept thinking about a solution, Karam was going to arrive by Friday, which was two days away.
I didn't have many options, and I didn't think of much. I either hide myself until I give birth, or go out and face humiliation.
I thought of some more things to do and I thought of something worse ...
I could get drunk with Jake then claim than I'm pregnant with his baby ... but he wouldn't even glance, he'd probably ditch me just like Simon did ...
Or I could have an abortion ...
Abortion ...
Abortion ...
Killing ...
What's the difference between abortion and shooting someone ? In both conditions we take life out of human beings. What's the difference ? That abortion takes a sole of someone who didn'r even get a chance to see this world?
I put my hand over my tummy, I rubbed it carefully, "You're a mistake, but I won't make another one by killing you, I promise" I hugged my unborn baby and tears hugged my face. I ran to the bathroom and vomited.
I went to bed, lied on my right side instead of sleeping on my tummy, and got the best idea ...
My tummy won't be very visible until the fifth month, I'd start eating more ... A lot more so become fat. Becoming fat was the only way my tummy won't appear way bigger than the rest of my body. It was a temporary solution until summer break, I did my calculations, when it's summer break time, I'd be in my 6th month, I'd leave, go away until I give birth. I didn't know what I'd do after I give birth ... I'd probably find a solution by then.
But, what about Karam ? What am I supposed to do ? How am I going to tell him ? He'd be living with me, he'd find out soon or later ..
....
I reached school after hours of applying make up just to hide the puffy eyes and dead soul, I noticed Simon, he was glaring at Jake who was wrapping his arm around my waist, I looked at Simon with tears willing to escape, "Where were you yesterday ? I saw your car in front of your house but you didn't open the door" Jake kissed me, "I was sleeping, but, what happened to your eye?" I said as I removed the sunglasses off of his face, I put it back, "Uh, 5 boys jumped over me as I was on your door, they stole my money" He lied, he was a great lier, I was awake enough to recognise voices, there was only one guy. But you know boys, they won't admit their weakness.
I walked in my red shorts, got flirted by some boys then the English teacher tapped my shoulder, "Yes sir?" I smiled at him, "I need to talk to you" I followed him to his class. "Have a seat" He said, "I don't know what to say ... but, what happened to you ? What's going on ? You're not the one I know ? And what are those grades?" He threw my paper tests on the table "C,D,F,F ? What's that ? What happened to you? You were the best, THE BEST. And now you're dating Jake Mark ! The jerk ! And what's going on with your attitude and clothes? A bully? Really Leena ? Shorts that show much more than they cover ? And your chest is about to pop out you blouse ! What the .. ?" He was angry. I looked in his eyes, I saw the look of care and fear that I used to see in my father's eyes. "LOOK AT ME IM TALKING TO YOU" He shook my shoulders, I couldn't look at him, I exploaded in tears, "Leena? I'm aware of what you might do to yourself next" He patted my back, "And now you're trying to fool the teacher ? How much lower can you get" I glared at Simon with my teary eyes, "I didn't allow you to get in" The teacher kicked Simonot out, I wiped my face and got out. Simon was waiting outside the class, he gave me a glare of shame then left.
