Me and Amanda were now exhausted from the running around the room. "I can't believe your leaving and I never heard you talk." I nodded and looked at her. I opened my mouth to say something. I saw how she got happy but I closed my mouth again.Â  I just didn't think it was time. I took my board from my bag and wrote I'm sorry and showed it to her. "It's fine. You have my number right?" I nodded. She had given me her number so we could text. "Alright. One them is waiting outside, another is doing the paperwork, and the rest getting the other child they are suppose to adopt."
I nodded my head and gathered my suitcase thinking about Amanda. I should at least just let her hear one word. Right? Nah. Not yet. I waved at her and she gave me a hug. I felt like I couldn't breathe. After she let me go I looked at the room again. It looked like how it did when I first got here. Amanda walked outside with me when I saw that Niall was the 1/5 of one direction waiting for me. "You ready?" I nodded my head. "You didn't forget anything right?" I nodded my head again. I thought it was cute how he was worried. "Alright." He grabbed one of my suitcases, which I wasn't expecting him to do, and led me to their car. He opened the trunk and put my bags inside. "Well, I have to go help the guys find a 3,4, or 5 year old. Wanna come?" I nodded my head. I loved little kids. We walked inside the 4 year olds section. Niall walked off somewhere while I admired the room filled with little kids. "Hi!" I felt someone tugging on my jeans. I looked down to find the most adorable girl ever. "Are you Lisa?" I was confused but I nodded anyways. "Amanda tells us stories about you. How you survived something tragic but don't talk anymore. Your my hero even though you didn't save anyone's life or anything." I smiled at her. First real smile I had in years. "Would you like to see my room?" I nodded my head. She grabbed my hand and led my across the room. "Sit." She said with a smile. I already loved her I don't understand how someone could give her up. I noticed her her struggling to get on her bed so I picked her up and put her on my lap. "Do you know sign language?" I nodded at her. I started to learn it right after the incident. "I know it too. I started learning after Amanda told us stories about you just I'm case I met you." I loved her. I wanted to kidnap her. "So what are doing here?" I didn't have my board with me and she knew the language so why not. "I got adopted" I signed to her. "Oh does that mean you won't be here anymore?" I shook my head. "I promise to come visit you though." I signed to her again. "Promise?" I nodded. I took out my phone and gave it to her. "Thank you" she whispered. I loved her. I can't stop saying it. She was laying back on me. I don't know how long it was but I noticed that she wasn't playing and heard light snores. I looked down at her to see her sleeping. A text popped up on my phone. It was from Amanda.
A: WHERE ARE YOU!!??!?! THE BOYS ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!
L: I'm in this 4 year old girl room. Across the main room.
A: Brianna?
L: I don't know? Forgot to ask her name and she is sleeping right now.
A: Is her door decorated with pink and princesses?
I looked at her door
L: Yeah
A: Brianna. I'll send the boys to you.
L: No problem
I didn't want to go. I didn't want to leave her. She's an angel. "OH THANK GOODNESS!" My head snapped to the door to find the boys out of breathe. I put my finger on my lips and they noticed Brianna. "Oh" they said at the same time. "She's adorable." I nodded and smiled at Niall. "We should adopt her." My eyes widened. "I'm guessing you found some type of connection?" I smiled and nodded. "Alright. We'll do the other paperwork." All the boys left except for Niall. "You seem really good with kids." I smiled and nodded. "I love kids" I signed to him. He looked confused. I realised that he probably didn't understand sign language. I laughed a little bit. "You have a cute laugh. Is that how your voice sound?"
I shook my head. I wrote what I was about to say on my phone. "Oh you love kids." He chuckled. He looked at me and I looked at him then looked away. I shook Brianna so she would wake up. She stirred on my lap which made me laugh. I was ticklish. I shook her more. She fluttered her eyes open. "What happened?" She asked. "You have to pack" I signed to her. "Why?" She looked confused and more awake. "Your getting adopted." I signed to her.... again. "By who?" I laughed. She ask a lot of questions. "The same guy who adopted me." Got off my lap my lap and in her closet. "She's adorable." Niall said again. I nodded. I decided to help Brianna pack. After packing for Brianna, the boys were putting her suitcase in the trunk while I carried her. She was adorbs.
