When I get back to America, I'll kick out the boss in Stylish&modest since it turned out to be ours ... naah, I ain't that bad.
Next day.
"Wake up" Simon knocked on my door, "Go away before Karam comes", "He told me to wake you up", "I dont feel like waking up, go away", "If you dont get out, I'm going to get in. Karam said that we're going to have breakfast out", "Ok". I got out of the bed and accidentally met the mirror, and I wish I didn't, red face, puffed eyes and messy hair, yesterday I kept crying until I slept.
"Simon, I'm ready, where's Karam h- What are you doing here?" I stared at uncle Muraad, he wanted to live in this mansion, I told him that I bought his part of it, he kept arguing, until I screamed at him, uncle Muraad took a step forward, raised his hand and was about to slap meÂ  "Listen to me man, it's over, get out, Leena doesn't want you here, it's her house and she decides who stays or leaves" Simon caught Muraad 's hand, "Get out of the way" they were about to get into a fight but Karam came out at the perfect moment and cooled everything down, I threatened Muraad, I told him that I'd gladly call the police if he didn't get out at that moment.
"Come on, get out" Simon said, it was 9 pm. After my uncle had left, I got back to my room and locked it, didn't eat or drink anything, Karam knocked on the door many times but I kept myself covered in blankets, I took the photo album from my parents' room and throwbacks hit me every time my eyes lied on a picture of us, we had always been happy, even when we didn't have bread to eat.
"Open the door or ...." Simon threatened, "Or what?", "Or else..." I ignored him.
My phone rang, Elina, "Hello" I said, "Hi, how are you?" She asked worriedly, "How can I be ?" We talked for an hour then I heard a knock on my window, must be Simon, "I'll call you later" I hung up and opened the window, "What do you want?" I said sharply, "If you keep showing without your hijab I won't keep looking away" Simon turned his head away, I got in quickly and slapped myself then covered my head, "Get down" He said, "Are you crazy?" I said loudly, "Shh, Karam will wake up, get dressed and get down", "What for ?" I sighed, "Have you ever done something crazy? Like sneaking out your room at night?" Simon smiled, "Listen to me, my parents died few days ago, I appreciate that you're doing your best to cheer me up but it won't work, you better get home soon to your family, thank you for everything, get back to your room and take the next plane to America" I closed the window, "But life must go on, you shouldn't torture yourself, that's what God wants, it's not your fault" I ignored him, in two seconds, Simon was opening my window and got into my room, "Get out, if Karam hears you, you're dead, leave" I watched him chuckle, "I once told you that there's no better way to die than dying for you. Now, listen, I know that you are hurt and that you lost the most precious people, but look at the bright side, they are in a better place now, they're together. And look at you ! You are a sexy billionaire 18-year -old girl. Believe me, if your father was alive, he would want you to move on"
"I really hate you" I said as I was driving my new Ferrari car with Simon beside me, "No, you don't, now let's go to Starbucks", "Why am I even listening to you?"
"You pay" I said, "No, you pay ! I'm your guest" Simon frowned, "You dragged me out of my room, you pay" I raised an eyebrow, "You got more many than I do tho" Simon said as he was paying.
"I've never seen your father" I said, "Neither did I" I felt pain in my chest, "How come?" I took a sip from the expensive but disgusting coffee that Simon chose for me, "Uh, he died when my mother was pregnant, cancer" Simon sighed, "Oh, sorry" A tear rolled down my cheek, "But he was good, mom said", "Of course he was good, he must have been handsome, look at you ! You are hot" Simon laughed out loud, I almost slapped myself after what I said, "Mom was the housekeeper of my grandparents' house, she worked to get money for college", "Really? What did she study ?", "Mom is a pharmacist. Dad liked her and kept hitting on her every time she goes to his parent's house to work, day by day, she fell in love with him the way he did, my grandparents disagreed and refused their relationship harshly, she was the maid and he was the rich young man, my grandfather considered her from the lower class" Simon was telling me the story of his parents and I was all ears.
