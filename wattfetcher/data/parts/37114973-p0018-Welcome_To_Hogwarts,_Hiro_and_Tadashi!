Malfoy was sitting on the couch with Luna in his arms, with her fastly asleep. The next moment, she returned back in her own age again and she held a blanket close to her. Malfoy looked down and smiled thinking how cute."Rise and shine." he mumbled while shaking Luna awake. Her eyes opened slowly and moaned. She rubbed her eyes then looked at her hands. Her eyes widened and sat straight up. "Morning, Beautiful." Malfoy cooed and went closer to her face. Luna blushed so hard and tried to get away, but Malfoy grabbed her arms tight."Get away!" Luna scolded but he still wouldn't let go. Then he kissed her... Oh dear!Tadashi, Rosa, and Hiro ran down the halls carefully without being spotted. They went up the stairs and made it to the Slytherin Entrance then got in.When the three of them made it to the common room... their eyes were widened in shock that Malfoy had connected his lips to Luna's. Tadashi felt something... he felt that his heart has broken into two but then it was back together, and steaming mad!"Get away from her!" Tadashi scolded, pushing him away from Luna. Rosa walked up to Malfoy and pounded, punched, and kicked him like no tomorrow."Tadashi..." Luna yawned. Tadashi looked at her and she was asleep. "Rosa! let's get back to our beds now." Hiro whispered. Rosa stopped and huffed. "Fine."Tadashi carried Luna back, bridal style and Rosa walked beside Hiro. They really don't want to mention this ever again.
