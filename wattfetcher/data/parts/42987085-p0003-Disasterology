He was so straightforward...and rude even. His tone made a clear that I was an unwelcome invite, and it got me a bit pissed. I mean gee I just got here! It wasn't fair. I sighed and went to my piano, flipping it on and deciding to play to calm down. Claire de lune filled the room as my fingers moved across the keys. After having played the song twice, I heard a knock at the door. I quickly stopped and went to get it.
Wes was there a towel wrapped around his waist leaving his abs and well built body into view. "Mom said to get into the shower and then go downstairs for dinner." he said a bit coldly. I tightened my jaw and then nodded. Why are you being so rude to me? It was honestly bothering me. I hadn't done anything had I? Besides maybe breath, blink and listen to what I was told. Why did I receive this kind of treatment? Wes raised a brow and laughed. "Rude? That was rude?" He stepped a but closer and smirked. "Arent you in for a show then." he smirked again before heading towards his door. "Its a highway to Hell for you, David; careful." he turned to wink at me before entering his room. I only glared at the door before grabbing my clothes and turning off the piano.
I had only just closed the door when from his room I heard the song Highway to Hell by ACDC. I glared at the door before kicking it and went to the bathroom. I had barely slipped off my shirt when I heard the door open. Wes stood there now in a black muscle shirt and matching shorts, glaring. "Hey. I said watch it. Kicking my door isn't watching it, bud." he snapped as his cheeks tinted pink. I guess he was one of those people who got red when he was pissed. I smirked and shrugged. I'm not watching shit, mate. I glared and then crossed my arms over my chest. I was so thankful I played football in my old school; I was lean and built meaning I could put up a fight with him and win it too perhaps if it ever came to it. "Oh, Mr. Sunshine, you don't know what you've gotten yourself into." he smirked. I glared at him. Same for you, Sir Dipshit. Wes gave a small cold laugh. "Bring it." he smiled. Oh, I will. I smiled sweetly back. He glared as his cheeks grew pink again and he closed the door rather harshly.
Ugh! What was with him! Jesus, he was such a jerk! I pondered over the question as I stepped in the shower and turned on the hot water. It hit my back soothingly and I sighed into it. I glared at the wall thinking of Sir Dipshit and then looked up. He asked for the bull, he's getting the fucking horns alright. Game on Wesley. Game on.
