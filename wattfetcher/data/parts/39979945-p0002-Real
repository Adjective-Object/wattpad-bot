"Jacquelyn, are you okay up there,luv?"

I hop into bed and cover myself with my bed sheets. I didn't say anything, and lye very still so she could think I was sleeping. Quietly, I hear her footsteps walking away. I stayed in bed for the rest of the day trying to get the thought of what happened out of my mind, but I couldn't. Because now I know that all those years of believing was a waste of time. Slowly, I close my eyes drifting into a dreamless sleep.
