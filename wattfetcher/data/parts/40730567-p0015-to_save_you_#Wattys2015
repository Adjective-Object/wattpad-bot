Everyone hated Mondays. It was a well-known fact. Jake hated Mondays too. That was the reason he was giving everyone a stinkier eye than usual. Why was there school on Mondays at 8 freaking 30 in the morning, he would never know. He opened his locker with such a force that it hit the other lockers making a loud sound. There was a note in his locker, with a leather bracelet. He took the note out of the envelope.
Mondays mean new beginnings. It's like waking up, starting over, with a fresh page.
PS I made this for you. Hope it fits.
Jake smiled. A real smile. He had a dimple on his left cheek. From now on, Monday would be his favorite day of the week.
