The girl had run out of the house with her friend close behind. To say she was heartbroken was an understatement. She felt like her heart had been squeezed and there was not a drop of blood left. She felt empty. And the worst part wasn't them kissing. It was the fact that Sky had lied. After all these years, she saw him be someone else's man right in front of her eyes.
Her friend had followed her outside. She called her name, causing the girl to halt. Her friend jogged up to her.
"Abrielle, you can't let her win this."
Mandy grabbed Abri's shoulders and shook her hard.
"She has always won, Abri, we can't let her win again."
Mandy was right. Sky always got it her way. Now it was Abrielle's turn.
so what do you think? did you expect Abri to be the anon girl? i've entered this book in the Wattys2015 and even though i only have like a 0.0000000000000000000001 chance of winning, your vote might still help. COMMENT AND TELL ME, "WHO DID YOU THINK WAS THE ANON?"
