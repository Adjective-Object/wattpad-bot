"Stylish & modest"
"Here we are" Elina sighed.
We entered the shop and I started to scan the clothes.
"That's awesome, That place sells hijaabs !" I commented
"Yeah it is" I turned around to face the person who agreed with me ...
Damon.
"May I know why are you here ?" I raised an eyebrow
"Hey man" Lewis hugged Damon.
"So Lewis invited you ha?" Elina glared at Lewis
"Not exactly. you see ... he sent me a text telling me how annoying and rude you are to him, so I though that it'd be a great idea if I come and defend you" He sounded innocent, which is totally the opposite of him.
"No thanks Damon, me and Lewis are good now, aren't we Lewis?" I glared at Lewis.
"Yeah totally, Uh, Come on Elina we need to bring the something we uh- you know why, So um"
"you are a terrible liar, Lewis" I said.
Damon glared at Elina.
"Oh yeah I remembered, come on" Elina pulled Lewis
"Hold on a second" I said loudly and both of them froze.
I stood in front of Lewis "give me your phone" I commanded
"What?" His eyes widened, "I said give me your phone" He gave it to me after he unlocked it.
I scrolled through his messages until I found what I wanted.
DAMON.

I handed Lewis the phone silently and walked to Damon
"Things are gonna get ugly" Elina whispered to Lewis
"Oh yeah, prepare yourself for Saw 8, we are gonna need some popcorn " He whispered back.
I saw Damon playing with his fingers nervously, He looked everywhere but my direction.
