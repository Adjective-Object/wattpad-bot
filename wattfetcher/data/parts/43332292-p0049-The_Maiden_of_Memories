Alright! You have reached the end of my NaNoWriMo journey, riddled with errors, misspellings, half-baked ideas, and cramming. The story was unfortunately only finished halfway, leaving many plot holes and a squished story. I think that this would be better if edited and given the time to be planned out thoroughly, which I will try to do next year.
Anyway, as an author who wishes to understand her audience, I have some questions for you. If you have the time, please comment your answers.
Speculations:
1.   	Given several hints and deliberate phrasing in story, what is Theo's secret?
2.   	Why does Hyas need the Talisman of Dreams?
3.   	Who is the woman at the end? Hint: she's important to Theo. If you know his secret, you will know who the woman is.
4.   	How did Theo and Alodia meet?
5.   	What is the purpose of the Talisman of Dreams?
Audience Rating:
6.   	What was your favorite line and who said it?
7.   	Who was your favorite character and why?
8.   	Did anything about the story stand out in particular?
9.   	Rate the four main characters according to how much you like them.
Criticisms:
10.	Anything about the story that's really bothering you? Like a really badly-written character, some fridge logic (like there are no books but there's fried fish), or something that seemed totally unnecessary (like I put it in there for no reason or I hadn't gone in far enough to execute the Chekhov's gun)?
11.	Other than the misspellings and errors (you're not supposed to edit your story during NaNoWriMo), what was bad about my writing style?
12.	Rate the four main characters according to how well-written they were.
Thanks for reading!
