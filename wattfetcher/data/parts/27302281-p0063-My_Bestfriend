" a very sexy one at that " he smirked pushing me slightly then I pushed him back and he almost fell over I laughed loudly and covered my mouth before it got embarrassing as we got in the house we heard agruing and walked towards the source Justin ,Chaz and Ryan were fighting over the last slice of pizza
"why don't we just order more"I spoke up picking up the phone and ended their agruing and walking off to order the pizza and felt two strong tattooed arms snake around my waist I pushed him away and he frowned as I continued to order then I ended the call and Justin grabbed me by the waist and pinned me againist the wall then looked down at me resting his forehead on the top of my head "what's wrong " he finally said I pushed him off
"not in the mood " I sighed walking past him being followed by Ryan and chaz and little christian Justin followed slowly behind them. I walked upstairs and into the dance studio and shut the door and sat down in front of the mirror and started stretching I hope they won't find me in here.
Justin POV
The guys started to walk upstairs but pushed them back down
" she's my girlfriend I don't need you trying comfort her she's mine got it" I hissed at them they stared at me in shock I ignored them and walked up the stairs in search of my girlfriend I heard muffled music and instantly knew where she was In the dance studio . yes I have a dance studio in my house get over it I sing and dance in my free time my mom had it put in last fall so yeah to the dance studio I ran through the hall and stopped at the door and opened it slightly sure enough kylie was dancing to one of my demos I had put away I walked in and turned off the stereo " you went through my stuff " I smirked not wanting to raise my voice
"Yes its very beautiful you should get a record deal " she chessed kissing my cheek
" very funny like that's gonna happen " I laughed wrapping my arms around her waist
" I came to see how you were doing but you look pretty happy " I said pecking her on the lips" I'm good" she smiled
" I was upset but it was stupid" she added and I lifted her chin
" nothing that made you upset can be stupid tell me" I said concerned
"Its nothing "she said looking away
"I don't want you to be mad at them" she added with a mumble
" who's they"I asked worried
"My parents they are making me move " she said and as soon as it left her mouth I frowned
" your leaving me " I asked to try to make sense of this she nodded and sat down on the floor
" you can still come over right" I asked she shook her head no
" I'm moving to America " my heart dropped
" your leaving Canada " I said quietly holding back tears
" Justin I have to " she said trying to convice me
" when are you leaving " I asked not wanting to believe this
"After my birthday " she answered
" that's only three days " I frowned
" So in three days I'm saying goodbye to my girlfriend" I questioned
" not goodbye just see ya later" she said softly
" I'm sure you can stay with me" I said trying to convince her too stay
" I can't its for the best " she said then walked off and I grabbed her arm and spinned her around to face me
