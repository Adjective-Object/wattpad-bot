going back into the room i handed her a whole roll of toilet paper making her shake her head.
we bursted into fits of laughter as she fell down but it was immeadiatly stopped when the same thing we hated so much went off when she fell,"GOD-YOU KNOW WHAT?!WHERE IS IT?!"she flew the blankets around that were covering it.
once she found it she took it and threw it at the ground making the music stop.the room was quiet then we bursted out laughing.i started working on my story more then saw she had moved her foot to the side of my computer.
i looked at her with my eyebrow raised.she took my arm and started spraying my hand with this highlight stuff,"oh no!you've got writing sin drum!"i rolled my eyes then started to type with my left hand.then she started to sprya my hair
,"oh my god!i like that in your hair like that."she said making my shoulders slump in irritation and discomfurt,"Come look in the mirror!"she said getting up.i groaned
,"why dont i just use my camra thats on my phone?"she frowned and whined,"no!come look in the mirror,you can wash your hand while your at it."i let out a defeated huff and got up.
