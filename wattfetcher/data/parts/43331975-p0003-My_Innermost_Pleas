Ha!  Look at me!  I'm speaking French.Yes, poubelle.  A simple word.  Makes you laugh?  You are the poubelle.  Of course, I cannot blame you.  I laughed at first, too--a young slob.  Only a few months back.  Funny, how one can change in such a short amount of time.  No, not funny.  Sad.
Oh, just ignore me.  I'm just a hopeless protester ranting.  Ranting thoughts...that's all the world is, a ball of thoughts, good or bad, like a trashcan.  Where's the recycling bin?  We don't have one.  We don't care.  We just throw everything into one big bin--the trash bin we call Earth.
