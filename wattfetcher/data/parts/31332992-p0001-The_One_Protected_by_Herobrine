There is a man, he started this, it is all his fault, most run at the sight of him. I would too, if I was like everyone else. The sight of him freaks a person out, he has white eyes, few are brave enough to say his name. I go one step farther, I call him a different name that most, but they understand better when I use the one they call him. Herobrine. My life is a mess, because he slaughtered my parents, okay he didn't slaughter them, but that's what people say. The truth is my *cough* father stole something from him, then he lead him to the house were me and the rest of my family were. Long story short I was the only one to survive the house being blown up. Correction barely survived, actually I was practically dead. Herobrine found a way to "revive" me, that is what caused my life to suck, well it wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for my sixteenth birthday present. So I guess I should tell the story now okay I think I will start from when I made my first friend. Shadow.
