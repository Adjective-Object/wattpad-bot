"I was your secret admirer, sending you messages and gifts" I stood in shock then memories hit me, the voice was the same, there was nobody else that knew about the orphanage and he called me cyppucake many times. How couldn't I know from the beginning ?
"Before I punch you, tell me why ? Why did you do it ?" I asked furiously.
"I wanted to know the real you, I wanted to know if the nice honest girl we saw at school is real and not faking it. I liked you since I saw you for the first time. When I gave you the expensive gifts and you gave them to the orphans, that was when I felt real feelings for you" He said, I sighed then walked closer to him and punched his face.
"OUCH" I shouted, "I guess I deserved that" He smiled, "That was for making me confused and hiding this thing from me for so long" I punched him again, "OUCH ! And what was the second one for?" He stretched his jaw, "Because the first one wasn't painful enough" I chuckled.
"Um, there's another thing, just promise you won't hit me" He begged, "Say it or I will kill you" I clenched my fists.
"You are not pregnant" He hide behind the tree.
