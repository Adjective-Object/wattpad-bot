Meet YN
My name's YN and I'm 17. I dont really go to school. Not because I don't want to or anything. I just can't. I have work to do, my family depends on me. I gotta do what I gotta do. My family needs me... and by family I mean my little sister. Her name is Chasity. But I like calling her Ty (pronounced Tie) I live with my alcoholic dad. my mom ran off somewhere(so I've been told) when I was 15. ever since then I've been on my own.
