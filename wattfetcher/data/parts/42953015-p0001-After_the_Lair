Hello, my name is Presley Elmer and I am quite obsessed with the Phantom of the Opera. After watching it many, MANY times, seeing it live, and memorizing the entire musical, I have come to the conclusion that I do not like the way it ends, and unless Ramin Karmillo is playing Raoul, I doubt anyone does. (SORRY. NO OFFESNSE) So here is my rendition of what happens after because, frankly, I can't change Andrew Lloyd Webber's beauty, but I can fantasize at the door he left open. SO, without further ado, let my opera begin...
