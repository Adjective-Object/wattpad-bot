"Can you guys shut up?!?"  I yelled.
"No, you two need to get up, it's past 12."  Cameron said.
"That doesn't mean you have to yell!"  I said, grumpily.
"If you don't get up, we'll send a pic of you and Matt sleeping to Nash, and you wouldn't want to see what Nash would do, would you?"  Cam asked, and I bolted out of that bed.  The guys laughed.
"Not funny!  I don't need to see what Nash would do!"  I exclaimed.
"Babyyyyyyy, come backkkkk."  I hear Matt groan.
"Like I said a moment ago, I do not need to see what Nash may do."  I said.
"Fineee."  Matt said and got up.  We went downstairs and Shawn had made lunch, so we ate, and Matt drive me home.  On the way back to my place, we talked a little.
"How long do you wanna keep this a secret from you bro?"  Matt asked me.
"Just until I know he would be ok with me having a boyfriend."  I said.
"You know that's never gonna happen."  Matt said.
"Then he'll never know."  I said.  Soon, we reached my house, and before I left the car, I gave Matt a kiss on the cheek.  "Thanks for everything."
"No problem beautiful."  He said.  With that, I got out of the car and walked up my front porch.  Now, to see how everyone will react to me leaving without their permission, and not telling them where I went I thought and went inside my house.
