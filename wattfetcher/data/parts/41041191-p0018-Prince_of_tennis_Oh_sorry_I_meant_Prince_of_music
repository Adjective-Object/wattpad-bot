Sakuno is a petite girl that has auburn hair and chocolate to honey-ish eyes. She is a regular in the girls tennis team which is quite different from the boys team, mainly because the girls team is more care free. Her hair was in twin tail which were braided. She wore a pink shirt that had a flower on it and a little design on the bottom she wore a white cardigan and wore a blue jeans that end at her knees, she wore white sandal shoes and had a brown bag with her to complete her look.
'Thats odd' THOUGHT Fuji who opened his eyes, startling others.'She could have said he instead oh his (ryuu)name and Ryoma would know who she is referring to so why did she say Ryuu name instead oh He ? I must get to the bottom of this'Fuji thought.
'Fuji must know something up I got to warn the others especially Ryuu since she the one who he is suspecting something from her' Thought Tezuka eyeing Fuji.
