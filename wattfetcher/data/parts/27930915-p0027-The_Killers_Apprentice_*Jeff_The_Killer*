He looks at me and gives me a small smile.
"Now get in bed, and I'll get the ice." I tell him. He does as told.
I walk out and get ice from the kitchen. I put it in a paper towel and walk back to Jeff's room.
"Here." I place the ice on his eye. He winces.
"Why are you so nice to me?" He asks me.
"You saved me. I would have been arrested if you didn't take me in." I tell him.
"I'm a murderer."
"Like you said, so am I. And I've always believed in giving everyone a chance. I can't judge you based on what you do to others, or your past. You've done no wrong by me." I explain.
He stares at me for a while as I hold the ice on his eye. "You're amazing." He finally says.
My stomach ties in a knot and my cheeks fill with color. "T-thanks you."
He chuckles. "'Thanks you'?"
"I meant to say thank you. Thank you." I say.
Jeff pulls me down to him and kisses me. The knot in my stomach tightens as I pull away. My heart is beating faster and harder than I thought possible.
"That's what I should have done before I left." He says softly as he pushes my hair back behind my ear.
I sit there, astonished, trying to process what had just happened. After a minute I finally push out; "Well thank god I'm not the only one who likes a killer."
