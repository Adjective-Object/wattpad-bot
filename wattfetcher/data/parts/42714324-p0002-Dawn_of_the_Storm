Snowkit and I cautiously walked into the camp surrounded by thornbushes. It seemed empty, I was expecting some cat to pounce on me and threaten me. I turned around, Snowkit was walking through Â a tunnel of furns near a small clearing, I quickly followed. It lead to a cracked rock, I watched Snowkit hurry into it.
"Snowy get in here quickly!" I ran inside to find Stealthheart lying on the ground breathing heavily. She had a wounded paw and a cut on her side. "Do you know anything about medicine?" Snowkit asked me.
"No!"
