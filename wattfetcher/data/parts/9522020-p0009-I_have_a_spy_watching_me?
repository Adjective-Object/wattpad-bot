The bell rang and they gave me a pass and my schedule. I looked at my schedule reading my first period.
Language Arts 10
Mattias, Dana
Room 102
I knew where I was going, but it wasn't the way to room 102. I turned around and placed my bag on my shoulders completely. Just as I had done that I had bumped into someone when I turned the corner.
"Owe." Is all I said when my leg felt like someone cut it.
"I'm so sorry! I-" Is all they said.
I looked up to see Chase O'Neil. That's when I gulped. I had liked Chase, but apparently he cheated on Tracy. She was my Best Friend, but then she started to spread lies so I'm guessing Chase cheating on her is a lie.
"Hey Jaycie. Um let me help you up?" He asked getting up as he extended his hand out for me.
I accepted his offer.
"Thanks" I muttered.
I still had feelings for him, but I still should pay attention and go to class. Forgetting which class I have to go to I look at my schedule.
"What class do you have?" He asked.
"Language Arts with Mrs. Mattias."
"I have her to. Walk with me to class?" He asked.
"Sure." I said.
He led the way and fortunately I was going the right way the first time. The bell rang when we were three feet away from the door. We entered the class and I went to the front of the class to hear even the people who were whispering to stop talking.
Mrs. Mattias turned around to say something to see me. She looked surprised.
"Hi. You are?" She asked.
I handed her the note, as I said, "I am Jaycie Everheart. I am the student who hasn't been to school for over a month now."
"OH! So your Jaycie Everheart. I was wondering who you were. Hello Jaycie. I am Dana Mattias. It's nice to meet you." Mrs. Mattias said.
I shook her hand saying it was nice to meet her as well.
"Well if you have time after class or school I can get you on top of everything." She said.
"After school is good if you have any time."
"That's totally fine with me!" She said. I gave her a small smile turning to go sit down. Everyone stared at me as I saw the last seat is next to Justin and Thalia. They smiled at me pointing to the seat. I smiled back as I sat next to them. Being in the second row makes me think of last year. It definitely got us to pay attention since our teacher was the strict literature teacher named Mr. Tyson.
They passed me a note that said that they were glad to see me. I had a bigger smile on my face. They always say stuff making me feel better even if they didn't know it they've always helped me. I could never not talk to them unless they weren't around or on Facebook.
