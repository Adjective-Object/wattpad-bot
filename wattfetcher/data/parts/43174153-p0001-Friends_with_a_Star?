Nahlia P.O.V
"Nahlia get up, it's 9:00am," my friend Ashley yelled. "Ugh," I said while getting up. I went downstairs and saw Ashley all ready to go to her job. She worked as a registered nurse at Birmingham Children's Hospital. "Finally your awake sleepyhead," she said while digging in her purse for something. Ashley was four years older than me which made her 24 years old.  I was glad to have a friend like her because she let me live with her after what happened to my family. Ashley and I were so close that sometimes I think she's my sister. "Bye Nahlia and don't forget about your interview," she said as she was heading out the door. "Do I have to go, I like staying home," I complained. She turned around and looked at me like the way moms do when they want you to do something and you say no, I really miss my mom. "Fine I'll go to the interview," I said while letting out a deep breath. "That's my girl," she said while pinching my cheek. "Okay bye now, I'm gonna be late," she said while speed walking to her car. "Bye," I yelled and she let out a wave before leaving. I closed the door and got ready for my new job.
---------------------------------------------------Skipped to McDonald-----------------------------------------------
"Hi, I'm here for my interview," I asked to woman behind the register. "Just wait here until the boss comes," she said with having no excitement in her voice. "Way to make a good impression lady." I thought in my head. I sat down on one of the chairs and looked around to see no customer. They must be slow on business today.
After like five minutes of total silence someone walked through the door. "Hi you must be here for an interview, am I correct," said the man. "Yeah," I said with a fake smile. I really didn't want to be here. "Okay, first lets go to my office," he said. I followed him to his office which located in the back of the McDonald. The office wasn't big at all, it could only fit about probably three people. "Take a sit," he said while he was about to sitting down. "Okay my first question would be what your name is?" he asked me. "Nahlia Horrison," I answered. It went on like that about an hour.
------------------------------------------------Skipped to their house-------------------------------------------------
I unlocked the door and went inside to see Ashley on the sofa watching a movie while eating popcorn. She saw me and smiled a big smile at me. She paused the movie and came running up to me. "Well, how did it go," she asked still having a big smile. "Good," I answered not having that much excitement in my voice. I saw her smile drop. "I got the job," I said with a smile. Her smile was back on. "Now my question is why are you home so early?" I asked her with my arms crossing and having a serious face. "Well I got two tickets for a cricket game tomorrow," She said with an excitement. I wasn't a big fan of sports so it didn't get me excited. "That is not the reason why you came home early," I said still crossing my arms and having a serious face. "Well, my boss told me that I need a little break from my work since I haven't taken a break in ages. "Oh," I said.
----------------------------------------------------Skipped to night time----------------------------------------------
We ate dinner and talked for a bit and then she decided that we should watch a movie, since I wasn't a fan about movies I decided to go to sleep. I went to bed thinking and thinking about my new job. I never had a job so this would be my first time and I'm pretty nervous. I finally fell asleep.
