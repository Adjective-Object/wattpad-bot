"YOU THINK I WOULDNT RECOGNIZE MY BEST FRIEND. I MISSED YOU FELLOW BITCHFACE!" Jaime yelled.
"I missed you too bitchacho. Can I spend time with my boyfriend now?" She asked as he pouted and got up and winked at me thrusting his hips obviously as Ronnie was checking her phone.
"Oh. My. God. Jaime. Stop." I said pausing in between each word and face palmed.
"PANTERA!" He yelled before running away back towards the dressing room down the hall. I heard the fucker from down the hall.
"DONT GO ON THE BUS! VIC IS DOING GROWN UP THINGS!"
My friends were insane, but I couldn't have it any other way with the perfect girlfriend and a successful band I can say I definitely had it made.
