"I can't promise anything."
"Please promise something." Dad said.
"What?" I asked.
"Promise me you weren't drunk, Jordan said you drank "one beer" the first time it happened, tell me that was it, one beer." He said.
"Yes, it was one. I was not drunk and I was definitely not drunk this time." I said.
"Do you remember our first kiss?" Jordan asked.
"Yeah, oh yeah, I got dizzy then too." I said shooting up from a slight laying down position.
"Oww!" I yelled as I grabbed my head remembering I had a migrane.
"Oh, lay down please." Mom said rushing to the bed.
"Oh yeah, ow." I said.
Mom left the room, dad chased her out and they talked in the hallway.
"Baby." Jordan said.
"Come here." I said patting the bed telling him to lay with me, he lied down and looked at me.
"What?" I asked when he smiled.
"I just -- never mind." He said.
"What?" I asked.
"Forget it."
