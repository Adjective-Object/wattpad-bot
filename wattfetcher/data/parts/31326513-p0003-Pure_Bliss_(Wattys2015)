I hope we can move soon.
Maybe life could take a change for the better.

"Good morning Jenny. " My mom walked into my room, "You're not going to school today be-CAUSE we found a house so pack your bags!!"
"Mom, I wasn't planning on going to school today. It's a Saturday. " I said, tearing up on the inside at the fact that my own mother got my name wrong.
"Well, great then! Start packing Holly!" She yelled as she walked out of my room.
I frowned at myself in the mirror for what seemed like ten minutes, but was probably just a few seconds. Then I went downstairs and grabbed an empty suitcase and several boxes and began putting my life into those boxes.
My memories of when my parents had actually loved me...had actually talked to me without forcing each other to do so.
"Ready to go? Pack what you can carry, That's all were taking." Mom said as she patted my head and left.
Diary Entry 245 Date: Saturday March 30, 2015
Today has been such an awful day. Packing took me a couple of hours and I'm still not done. My hollow parents expect us to be done by tomorrow but moving from California to Florida will take over two days. I'm actually really scared. What if the people at my new school hate me there too? And dad said the reason for the move was because he got promoted and he wants to have sex with mom on the beach. That's actually really, really grooss, if they wanted to do that why not on the beaches here in California?? What kind of parents tell their kid that? I mustn't complain, they give me food, water, shelter, and allow me an education. Anyway, it was great talking to you, I have to go finish my boxes of sentimental stuff which isn't much. Talk to you later.
Love, Pure Bliss ♡
Tomorrow would be a long day. That was for sure, possibly the next week would be but, I'm not complaining.
