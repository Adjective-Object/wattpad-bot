Well, this is awkward.
Completely awkward.
So my friend showed me a picture of an anime guy and I was like,"HOLY S** NUGGETS!"
I meant to say,"HOLY SEXY NUGGETS!"
Than everyone burst out laughing while I stood there blushing.
It was soooo weirdddddd
I regret it so much!!
I always say things before thinking
I hate it >_< :(
