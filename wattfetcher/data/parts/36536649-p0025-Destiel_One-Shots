"Dean?"
Dean sighed. This was the third time(this week) Cas had showed up in his door, asking for help with his sleep. The ex-angel was having problems with it.
The first night, Dean went with a change of clothes (Cas was now wearing one of Dean's AC/DC shirts and sweatpants) and a bedtime story. So he got Cas clothes to sleep in. But the story? He had to find that.
"Stay here," he told Cas, after he put him on his room.
"Sam?" he had whispered. "Do you have any good bedtime stories?"
"Ugh," he groaned. "Harry Potter... over there... go away, please."
Harry Potter would have to do.
"Cas?"
"Yes, Dean?"
"I have a bedtime story."
So he laid down next to Cas on the bed. And he read three chapters before he finally heard Cas' snoring.
But the problem with that was they liked it so much, they read it during the day instead of before bed.
The second night Cas couldn't sleep, Dean got cookies (He didn't bake them from scratch, he found the Walmart package and popped then in the oven) and prepared warm milk.
Dean also sang Hey Jude to him.
Cas was asleep halfway into the song.
This was the third night, and Dean was out of ideas.
"Okay... uhm... C'mere," he said, motioning towards the bed.
"Um, Dean? Aren't you already in the bed?" Cas asked.
"There's room for two," Dean replied with a sleepy smile.
"Okay. Only if you're sure," Cas said, and Dean thought he heard a hint of a smile in his voice.
"I'm sure."
So Cas crawled into the bed. And then Dean hugged him close and kissed his forehead. Cas snuggled closer into Dean's side.
The only time Cas ever had trouble sleeping again was when Dean wasn't there.
