"I am very disappointed. You always let us down. When will this stop Malikah? When will you realise that we are Muslims! We don't do all this, it's haram!" Screamed my mum, with hurt clearly written all over her face. "I'm sorry mum." It was all I could say, truth is I am sorry, I don't know why I always make mistakes. It was always my lame answer."That was the final straw! That's it we are going to Saudi Arabia next week for Umrah, inshallah I want to see a change in your behaviour. You have to realise your 19! Not a 14 year old!" Ummi was very hurt, I didn't know what to say, I must change, I told myself over and over again.
I went upstairs to my room feeling upset and very guilty and began packing for Saudi. I kept thinking to myself that 'I can't hurt my parents like this! They are old! I need to change my ways!' I walked to the mirror, my jet black hair was a mess from running my hands through it and my green eyes where puffy from crying, my pale skin looked super pale. I couldn't help but cry even more, I felt a lot of anger towards myself for putting my parents through a lot of pain. All those thoughts came back to me, all those memories.. We were originally from Lebanon, I was born in the UK and so were my siblings but my parents where from Lebanon. My mum was beautiful with creamy skin, light brown eyes and jet black hair. My baba had light brown hair and hazel/green eyes with his caramel skin tone.
"Ya Allah! Guide me." I silently prayed. With that I began packing, I was feeling kind of excited to go do umrah but I was also feeling a little nervous knowing that my whole life will change. Inshallah (God willing) for the better.
"Malikah!" I heard my mum shout. "Yeah ummi?" I ran downstairs to see what she wanted to say. "I assume you don't have any abayas and hijabs? So I'm taking you out to get you some." I nodded and went upstairs to put on my jacket and shoes.
After buying loads of abayas and hijabs to take and finally finished packing. I hope I can now change for the best. 'Malikah your parents will never shed another tear because of you!' I thought to myself...
Sorry it's short. It's my first story, please bare with me! Xx
