Luke snaps me out my thoughts as he kisses my forehead, causing me to lean on his shoulder. I look over at the instruments and remember show choir together and how he always sang for me quietly. Then I remember the first time I heard Cal and Mikey sing at lunch to Blink-182 loudly. I even remember the first time I met Ashton and the date we had, now we're great friends and he respects me like a sister. I never heard him sing before until now but he sounds great.
"Whatcha thinkin'?" I look up at Luke and smile.
"I don't know, just everything I guess. I'm really happy for you guys and I want the best for you. I'll just be behind the scenes supporting you guys the whole way." I smile and Luke just pulls me into his lap and bear hugs me.
I hear a door open and close but I don't look to see who it is, because I don't care. I want to live in this moment with Luke as much as possible, I need him and I may not know if he needs me but I'll be there for when he does.
