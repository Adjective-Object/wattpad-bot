Being there for me,Gab we,Yeah no,We got our own flow,We have our own thing,People think we cling,To each other,As we grew closer,But honestly,Coincidentally,I dont think that's true.
We were always close,Just secretly at the most,We sometimes get kinks like a garden hose,But we never get lost,Or stray very far,We know who we are.
And I know it's sad to say,Expressing your feeling in a poem is so cleeshay,But we have always been friends,And as they say date your best friend,So what do you say?
A/N: please don't comment until he does guys. It would just kill me to see a comment notification and see it's not from him. But you can comment after :D.
This chapter is especially for @GabeCorrea but you know so is the whole book but whatever Hahaha. Oh yeah sorry for being irritating on the phone a little while ago Gabe, sorry.
