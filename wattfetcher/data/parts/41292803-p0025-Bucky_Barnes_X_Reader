It was just another day in the life. We were training again when a Hydra agent came in.

I see that you have been training. Both of you will do very well with what Hydra had planned for you. Come.Â The person snapped her fingers and immediately two guards were on either side of Bucky and I.

I sighed. I wondered absently why Hydra delighted in our suffering. We entered an interesting room. It was windowless and everything was painted black. One single naked light bulb hung from the ceiling.

You will now fight each other. You must. If you do not, I will shoot one of you. Your choice. The person said.

Ok. I said confidently. Bucky looked at me in horror. My eyes flashed a warning. He didn't get the message.

What? I am not going to fight you.

Yes you are or one of us dies. We have to cut our losses. What are the rules? I said addressing the agent.

Oh. First one on the ground looses. We really just want to see your strengths at this point. Tomorrow, we will test you in a more mental way.

I sighed. Bucky read my mind. He knew this was just going to be like training. It went well. We sparred for a few minutes then he flipped me and I was on the floor. We were taken back to our cell. My fear in my eyes must have been evident.

Don't worry. I am sure we will be ok. What's the worst that can happen? Bucky said.

I could lose you.

Do I really mean that much to you?

If only you knew. I said. I gently touched his face and he smiled. He pulled me close to him and held me.
