I sat in the cage bewildered. "Who's there?" I questioned.
I heard a soft chuckle and approaching footsteps. Damn. It's too dark to see.
The kidnapper got close enough for me to see him. He wore a white suit and masquerade mask.
Dammit. It's no use! I have no clue who this could be!
I scooted farther back in the cage as he stood in front of me.
"There's no need to be frightened, my sweet robin." He smirked as he saw my fear.
I winced at the revolting nickname he had given me. Pervert.
"Who the hell are you?" I asked sternly.
His grin widened. "Who am I you ask? My dear robin, I'm Lord Druitt."
That name...
"Y-you were arrested for human trafficking!" I sneered.
Lord Druitt laced his fingers through the cage. "Was, my dear. But fear not! I'm a free man currently."
My (E/C) eyes widened at his remark. How the hell did he get out of his arrest?
"If you're wondering, sweet robin, I bribed my way out of jail." His eyes wandered onto my body.
I turned beat red. "P-pervert!" I stuttered.
Lord Druitt laughed darkly and unlocked the cage. "Your hand, my robin." He said as he extended his hand to me.
"No! Stay away from me!" I refused, slapping his hand away.
His grin disappeared in dissatisfaction. He looked... scary.
"Fine." Druitt muttered.
He slammed the cage shut and locked me in again. Lord Druitt turned on his heel and began to walk away. I sat in silence. Damn... If I took his hand I could've escaped.
Without warning, the air is filled with a purple mist. A sick, sweet smell invades my nose. My eyes started to fade away.
"Ngh..."
Ciel's Point Of View
I wake up and instantly realize what happened.
Some how, our carriage was hijacked. Sebastian and (F/N) were missing. Dammit.
I glanced out of the window. The carriage wasn't in motion. Instead, it sat in the middle of a forest.
"Bloody hell."
(F/N)'s Point Of View
Darkness.
Damp,
Cold,
Lifeless,
Darkness.
My mind and vision was clouded over. I didn't have the strength to open my eyes. I lifted my head slightly. I felt my (H/C) hair fall onto my face.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is the jewel of the night! She's a fine woman! We'll be starting bids at 10,000!"
Lord Druitt.
Bids.
I'm part of an auction, aren't I?
