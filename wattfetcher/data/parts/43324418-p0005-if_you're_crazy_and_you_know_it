So in my back yard, there is a cat, right?And i am on a camping trip for a week.  Well,i was going home home to get some firewood, and i had called my neighbor to see if she was able to feed our cat, Felix. But apparently, my mom had called THREE OTHER PEOPLE to take care of his food. Not only that, they were ALL there when i got home.
So here i was, a thirteen year old, trying to get four people to understand that i didn't need ANY of them there today. Now i have ONE person cat-sitting. As it should be.
