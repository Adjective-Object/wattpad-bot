Tigers p.o.v.	I was born into a wealthy family. We lived in a big house in a very good neighborhood. I was the oldest of 8. I know a lot of little siblings to look after, but I didn't mine.there was wolf the second oldest and hard headed,me and him never got along.now Jon the third oldest was smart and loved machines, we got along well enough he never argued when I said something but the main thing we had in common was our hate for wolf now that is a different story and I'll tell you why later but back to my siblings. Then there was diamond the middle kid, we got along but she was always I trouble I would come along and bail her out always. Then there was Landon the boy wonder of our family with blond hair and blue eyes you could tell he was going to be a heart breaker. Lastly there were the triplets jasmine,kinze,and Cheyenne. They looked up to me until they where taken from me on that day. I forgot to mention wolf was my twin brother even though we looked and acted nothing alike. I'll give you my story of what happened that night......
