That night consisted of very passionate and heated sex. They were madly in love with eachother. Nothing could change that.
After 9 months of being engaged they finally got married. Reece was speechless as Chloe walked down the aisle. They said their vows and were finally Mr and Mrs. Reece Carter.
Now Reece being 28 and still the campion of the Cambyses Championship he bought a home for him, his wife and their 2 year old daughter Camila. She had Reece's eyes and Chloe's hair. Beautiful as anyone would say.
Chloe graduated med school and was proud of herself. She knew that her late father would be too.
Everyone was happy. All the trouble and heartbreak that she went through in high school was all worth it in the end. She wouldn't change a thing. And neither did he.
