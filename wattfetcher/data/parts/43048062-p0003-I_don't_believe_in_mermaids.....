Aubrey's POV
Having a mermaid tail is such hard work, and guess what?! We have a pool party to go to on Friday to celebrate no more school! I can't go in the pool!
Friday night at the party
Me, Evelyn, and Simone are sitting in chairs far away from the water.
"So, this is boring!" Says Evelyn
"I agree" says Simone
"Yea, Tails make life so much harder!" I say
"Why are you not going in the pool?" Asks....ugh, it's makena, she is the most popular and mean
"Well, we don't want to! Gotta problem with that girlie?" I ask makena
"Sheesh calm down, your acting like a cranky monkey!" She says, her two best friends, Zoe and Samatha laugh. They flip their hair and sashay away.
"Ugh, she's a jerk" I say
"Yuppers" says Evelyn
We giggle
"That's my second fav word" says Simone
"What's the first one?" I ask
"Perpendicular"
We laugh, some kid cannon balls into the pool and splashes us
"RUN!!" I scream
We run into the bathrooms and into a stall, are tails come back
"Great! Makena saw us scream run!" I say
"Oh no, I hear voices!" Says Simone
"I saw them go in here." Great its makena!
"LOOK!" Screams Zoe
"They see our tails!" I scream wisper at Evelyn
Samatha opens the stall door and they all gasp in shock
"You three?!?! Mermaids!!!???" Screams makena
"MAKENA SHHHH!" I say
"Why should I?! Your a mermaid!!" They try to run out
"STOP!!!" I scream, I raise my hand at them and they faint!
"A-Aubrey? What did you do?!" Asks Evelyn
We dry up our tails and get our legs back, makena and the others wake up.
"Where am I? And why am I with you three nerds??" Asks makena
I roll my eyes
Makena and her minions leave
"MEMORY WIPE OUT!!" Screams Simone
"You wiped their memory's of seeing the tails!" Says Evelyn
We do a group hug
"That can be really helpful! How did you do it?!" Asks Simone
"I don't really know! I just thought about it and I said stop and they just fainted!"
"Let's go back t the party, people will get suspious" says Evelyn
We head back to the party
