This is the ninth one today. Oh well.
I have regrets. I regret walking home alone that night. I regret "complying" to rape. I regret staying silent. I regret fighting. I regret suicide attempts. I regret my lost friends. I regret those who I got too close to. I regret funerals I didn't attend. I regret notes I've written. I regret late nights. I regret not sleeping. I regret opening up. I regret trusting those people. I regret waking up. I regret living. I regret crying. I regret yelling. I regret Skype calls. I regret those fish tacos. I regret cigarettes. I regret smiling. I regret almost everything. I hate it. Just to sum it up, I regret my life.
