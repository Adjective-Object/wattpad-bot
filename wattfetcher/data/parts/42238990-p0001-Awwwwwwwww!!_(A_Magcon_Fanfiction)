It has been ten years since the indent when, it happened. I mean I should not care he was just a jerk and he was my father. I still miss my brother and mom.
Now I'm moving to Las Angles, California. To go to collage at the age of 17 I mean my birthday is the day I arrive so tomorrow as I'm writing this to you my future husband I love you who ever you.
