"No, he doesn't," Sakura said. "He drinks Beth's coffee back at home too."
Michael blinked and frowned at her. "You didn't make coffee for him at home? That's mean."
Sakura chuckled. "Only sometimes." She turned to the brothers and noted they looked as if they were afraid to drink their coffees, except for Conrad, who was enjoying his tremendously. She wondered if she should have put salt in their drink just for the fun of it. But then again, she wasn't that mean.
"Well?" she said. "Drink up before it gets cold."
The brothers, excluding Conrad, looked down at their cup of coffee as if there were poison in it. Nicolas picked his up and slowly, while all his brothers had their eyes on him, took a sip. The brothers waited, watching him. Nicolas closed his eyes. He tasted the smooth blend of the coffee bean. It was beautiful, amazingly delightful in his mouth. He flashed his eyes open and took another sip.
"Good?" Logan asked.
Nicolas nodded. Logan, knowing if it had passed Nicolas's stamp of approval it had to be very good, quickly drank his. "Whoa! This is the best coffee I've ever tasted." Then he proceeded to drink some more.
One by one the brothers drank theirs and sighed with pleasure. They all agreed it was one of the best coffees they'd ever had.
"Now I know why Dad doesn't like Beth's standard coffee," Hayden said, shaking his head. "After this I don't think I'll ever go back to standard coffee again."
"Me, too," Logan said, and the brothers laughed.
