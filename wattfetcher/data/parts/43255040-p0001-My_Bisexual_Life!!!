Well im 18.Ima senior at Bridgewood High(ion knoo if its real), gotta booty like Big Booty Judy, light skinned with deep dimples, swagger nd love shoes, oh and im bisexual. I had a girlfriend but she cheated, had a boyfriend but when he found out that I was bisexual he broke up with me. When I told my parents, Heather and Rod, they were furious. I told them if they couldnt accept me for me then they gon have to deal with it. I have a brother and a sister. My brother name is James. He's also in the drug game with my dad. He's 20 years old. He has a girlfriend name Melisa. She's pregnant with a girl. She's 5 months pregnant. When James told mom and dad, mom was happy but dad didnt want us to get pregnant or be a parent at a young age cause they were. My sister name is Nicole. She is straight up gay. I love her for who she is and my brother accepts both of us. When she told mom and dad, they were furious but she told them the same thing i told em. She's 18 and also a senior.
