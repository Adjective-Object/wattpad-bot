Today I realized something very important. Every time I get mad or upset my parents my parents always snap at me and say things like "Don't be mad" or "Don't get upset" and if I did get mad or upset then my parents would yell at me and punish me.
They taught me to bottle up negative emotions and pretend they don't exist. They NEVER EVER NOT ONCE allowed me to express them.
I was never allowed to express negative emotions. I was told I had to bottle them up and pretend they don't exist.
But you can't do that. Because emotions HAVE to be expressed. They will just build up until they overflow and burst through the dam you built.
And when they do finally boil over, I can't express them. So I release them the only way I can think off.
