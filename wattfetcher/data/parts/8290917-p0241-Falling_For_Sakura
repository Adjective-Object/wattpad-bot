Logan said, "Now I'm just hoping Ned could help us."
"Or better yet," Hayden put in, "Knows where she is."
"Good," Sebastian said. "Goodnight, everyone."
"Night, Seb," the brothers said in unison.
Sebastian headed into his room and crashed on the bed. She closed his eyes and felt his heart constricted.
"Sakura," he whispered under his breath. "Come home, sweet heart. Please, just come home."

Darcy turned off the engine, got out, and slammed the door shut. He headed to the boot and took out the painting he had bought from the Tanaka's gallery. With the securely wrapped art under armpit, he headed to the door and up the stairs where his loft was located.
A few moments later, he let himself in. After placing the art carefully against the walk, he went about showering. Once refreshed, his dark hair wet and wearing only a loose trouser and his tone torso bare, he returned with a bottle of water in his hand. He took a big gulp as he stared at the wrapped painting long and hard. Then as if he couldn't help himself, he ripped the brown paper, revealing the exquisite painting beneath. Slowly, he caressed paper canvas, tracing the line and feeling the rough texture of the paint of the pink blossom. It again reminded him of Sakura and the cherry blossom tree in the woods, and a lumped formed in his throat.
"Sakura," he said softly under his breath. "Come back. Please come back, sweet heart."
