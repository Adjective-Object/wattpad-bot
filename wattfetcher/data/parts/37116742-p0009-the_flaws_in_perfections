It's the burning sensation Flowing through my throat. The water in my eyes The final goodbyes A beautiful mistake.
I shut her out It's not her fault She kept me breathing And I left her behind
I was the problem I'm always the cause She did nothing I was always wrong
And now that she needs me I'm afraid I won't be able to save her If I can't pull it together I may loose her forever
My heart would not last One more minute My lungs would not take Another breath
She cannot leave now Not tonight Not tomorrow Not without me
