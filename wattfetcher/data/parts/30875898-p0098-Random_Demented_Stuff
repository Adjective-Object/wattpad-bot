In the January skies, I fall for all the lies
In the February trees, I climb to know the meaning
In the March colors, I look but that doesn't mean I'm seeing
In the April clouds, I sink into the white
In the May sun, I watch as the people until there's only one
In the June flowers, I watch them walk with the bride
In the July fireworks, I watch all the colors burst
In the August rain, I see every clear water stain
In the September dust, I lay my head to rest
In the October wind, I cry myself to sleep
In the November leaves, I hide from everyone
In the December snow, I let myself freeze
