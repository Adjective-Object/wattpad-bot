"Y/n wake up! We are in Chongqing!" I heard my mum whispered to me and shaking my arm. I woke up and packed my stuff in my carry-on bag and checking my seat before i exited the plane. We went to find our luggage before we flagged a taxi. We took a taxi and went to the place that my dad told the driver. I looked at the surroundings when we were on the way. The place is really cleaner than America. The taxi driver stopped in front of a school, a all-boys school to be exact. I looked at my dad and back at the school name. "Erm dad is this the school you enrolled me in? Do you know this is an All-boys school?" I asked my dad. He nodded his head and said," This is the school you will be attending from today onwards. Even though it is an all-boys school, Your aunt is the principal of this school. So i enrolled you in here." I looked at him with my eyes widened."
