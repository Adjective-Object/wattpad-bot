Carter then again locked eye contact with.HeÂ had a cocky smile on his face and sat about 2-3 desks away from. We still kept eye contact i eventually got insurecure so i looked anywhere but him.
***********Few Classes Later**********
It was finally Lunch now i can finally feed my 5 stomach. I swear i eat like a pig, but oh well i dont give two shits about what others think about my eating.I walked into the lunch room and got my food i got pepporini pizza my favorite food of all time,apple juice and a boring apple.
"hey selly" isabelle said selly is my nickname
"Hey" i said "Omg your eating an actual apple like healthy food" isabelle said A.K.A Isa
"well they gave me an apple and i mostly eat just junk food... so thats what im eating an apple, and it doesnt even taste good, but whatever im hungry" I said bitting into my apple
the rest of the girls sat down after we finished eating we heard shouting you didnt even need to turn to see who it was. it was carter as usaully. he was screaming at some red head named abby shes actually very sweet but a slut at the same time
"get the fuck out of my face we happened only one time and one time only" Carter said clearly annoyed of her presence
"but yo-o-ou said you wanted to see me to-o-o-mor-r-ow" said with face full of tears. I felt bad for what Carter did to her.
"yeah in the bed" he then walked up to her and whispered in her ear but loud enough for us to hear "you were good last night bitch" abby blushed,but you could still see the tears on her face.
"wow what a asshole" charla said "I Know right he's more than a dame asshole" i said I Think I said that a little too Loud because next thing you know carter and his "gang" heads toward our table. I was scared shitless So the next thing I did was grab my food and threw it in the grabage and walked out of the lunch room. I would've stayed but honestly carter scares the crap out of me.
I started walking around the school until the girls catched up. "hey selly" Taylor said "what oh hi guys" I said
"So are you going to the party" charla said i gave a confused look "what party?" I said clearly puzzled "oh theres a party at brads house" charla said which made me blush. See i have a major crush on brad since like 4th grade.
"Look I dont know if can go im not really a party girl" I said
"OH come on not even for brad" Taylor said winking at me I rolled my eyes and lucky for Me I was saved by the bell.
"bye girls" i said walking away
"if you dont go we'll get you ourselfs" taylor said
*********After school*******
i headed outside to meet the girls I got outside and waited by our spot. when I got there Carter showed up by me. I rolled My eyes " what do you want now carter" i said.. man this kid just annyos the fuck out of me whenever he can.
"Hey princess you going to the party tonight" he said he had a cocky smile on his face.This is actually the first time I didnt stutter and stood up for myself. "And why would you give a fuck if I go or not" i said he just pisses me off ugh why did he have to come back to school seriously
