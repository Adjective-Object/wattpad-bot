I'm wandering along the line of life and death, weaving my fingers through the fabric if the universe.  Catch me, then--watch me as I squirm through the words of hate, the actions that time gives birth to.  If you can find where I pause to wonder, grieve, consider...then take me.  I'm only here because I refuse to leave.  If you can pull my head from mere existence, find where my footsteps falter and find a line, by all means, pull me back into the crisp reality I have run away from.  I am not hidden, and yet, nobody can find me.
Not even me.
