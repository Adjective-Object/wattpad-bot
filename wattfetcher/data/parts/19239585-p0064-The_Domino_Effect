"No. I need to finish. I never start something I can't finish." Jade clamped her mouth shut, allowing him to continue.
He continued with his story. "Anyways. We were staying in a log cabin for the summer. Loraine, my girlfriend, we hadn't been married yet, was putting Lilly, my daughter, down for a nap. I drove down to the store to get some more food and other essentials. When I came back the cabin was on f-f-ire." Here comes the stuttering. His chin quivered. "The flames were so big. . . Loraine and Lilly died in that fire. I had no idea what to do after that. The centers of my life, both of my worlds had vanished. So, I joined the military hoping to benefit someone. Guess that answers your question. and, uh, sorry you had to see me like this." Rick lifted his sleeve up to his face, rubbing it against his damp eyes.
"Rick, I'm so sorry. I don't know what it's like losing someone you love more than anyone else in the world, but I'm sure it was hard. But look where you are now? You're on a great path. Keep going Rick. Don't give up." Jade gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
"I won't. I made Loraine a promise when she told me the news of the baby." Rick thought back to those green eyes. That was the happiest he had ever seen his soon-to-be wife. Didn't even get to propose.
"Looks like we're here," Rick said, looking ahead. He parked close to the entrance and Jade undid her seat-belt.
"Thanks . . . for everything," Jade said.
"Thank you too," Rick said. "And please. Don't make Ian go through what I went through. Come home. Safely."
"I will. I made a promise too. Just another vow atop of another."
And with that, she walked away to her next mission, the breath visible coming from her little nose as she walked up the sidewalk to headquarters.
"You'll be alright, kiddo. I know you will," Rick mumbled under his breath. "You always are."
