"Why did you care less?" He questioned, "Wait, sorry its none of my business."
"It's fine, I'm just I don't know I'm taking the break up worse than I thought I would. I really loved her, hell I thought she was the one." I told him honestly.
"How long were you together?"
"Almost two years."
"Then you have all the right to be mad, sad, whatever. That's a long time to be with someone."
"I know but I need to just get over it. Especially since we have this tour and all."
"Relationships are stupid anyway. Sometimes its nice just to be single for once."
"It really is," I told him. "I think I'm just done with relationships altogether."
"No, don't say that. You'll find the one girl." He said, "It just takes time."
"Who knows. Maybe I'll just hook up with Johnny a couple of times or something." I said.
"From the things I heard, that's a stupid idea." He said, "Take a break from everything, that's a smart choice."
"What have you heard?" I asked not even paying attention to what he had said afterwards.
"Vic. Vic? Vic we're here!" He said poking me a little, "You totally zoned out on me."
"Oh sorry." I muttered, "When we're done here can you tell me what you were saying? Like what you've heard?" I asked him.
"I don't know. If you zone out well sucks for you then."
"You suck." I whined and opened the door to the restaurant and looked around, "So where is he?"
"He is... " He looked around for a minute, "Over there!" He pointed to one of the seats in the back. He grabbed my arm and pulled me along towards him, "Kells!"
A boy who looked about Alan's age looked up at us and smiled, he had the most breathtaking smile and I couldn't help but to smile back at him.
"Hi." He said as we both sat down.
"Hi." I said to him.
"Kellin, Vic. Which you know, but Vic this is my best friend and hopefully new merch guy, Kellin." Alan said.
"Nice to meet you," I said and reached a hand across the table to shake his hand. Kellin blushed and took my hand shaking it slowly.
"Nice to meet you too."
"I'm gonna go get a coffee, Vic want anything? Kells?" Alan asked getting up.
"Yeah you know what I like." Kellin said looking away from me and back to his best friend.
"Alright, and Vic?"
"Just water is cool."
He nodded before walking off to the counter.I turned back to Kellin, "So tell me about yourself."
"Uh, I really like your band and stuff."
I laughed, "Well I'm glad, anything else? What do you like to do? Why do you think we should hire you for this position? Things like that." I said prompting him to go on.
"I'm really good at math and dealing with people and stuff like that."
I nodded, "Alan said your a genius with numbers. So that's good because if you get the job you'll be dealing with money and counting and what not but you need to be able to do more than just be good with numbers. Are you fast on your feet? Because you'll be running around a lot getting more merch and helping the other merch girls and guys."
