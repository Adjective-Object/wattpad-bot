Castiel sighed as he opened the door to the apartment he shared with his boyfriend, Dean Winchester. He honestly just wanted to lay down and sleep - it had been a long day at the kindergarten where he taught - but he knew Dean would be hiding somewhere, waiting for him.
"Honey, I'm home!" he called out. No answer. "Huh. Guess he's playing hardball," Castiel said to himself with a smile.
He walked to their bedroom and was greeted with a bed with rose petals scattered on it. But no Dean. In the middle of the roses lay a note.
Dearest Castiel,
Heya, Cas. I know you probably had a long day, but there's something you need to know.
You need to know that you are everything.
You're the universe, only better.
You're the all the galaxies, every planet, the sun, and every other star in existence.
You're every book ever written, every picture ever painted. Every song ever played, every word ever spoken.
The universe, only better.
It's a true shame no one else knows how fantastic you are.
You're my secret paradise, my invisible ink, my bumblebee, my fallen angel.
No one else could ever love you as much as I do.
Love, Dean
Castiel was in tears. How lucky he was to have Dean. Then he read this:
P.S. I'd really appreciate if you looked in the closet. It's kinda cramped in here.
Castiel squinted at the paper, confused. But, he obeyed and went over to their pretty sizable closet.
He opened the door and found his boyfriend.
On one knee.
With a ring.
And a shit-eating grin on his face.
"So, you, uh, read the note?" Dean asked.
"Yes," Castiel answered through tears. "Dean, are you proposing?"
"Oh, this thing?" he said. "I just wanted to, you know, ask you to marry me?"
"Dean, yes."
"Yes?"
"Yes."
Castiel stayed up with his fiance - he liked the way the word sounded - the rest of the night, sleep be damned.
