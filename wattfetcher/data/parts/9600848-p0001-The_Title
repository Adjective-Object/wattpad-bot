This is the description of the book I am meant to be writing. This book really isn't interesting, so why not just leave and read another story?
You are? Oh the joy! Yet you are still here.... Reading this text that does not really make sense.... Off you go now. No need to still be here..... Come on! Just press the arrow! Your so close!
Ugh.... I give up.... You know what? I could just stop writing and you would have nothing to read! What a brilliant idea! Well this is it.... The end of the story.... Never to seen again. My final goodbyes. Best of luck to everything.
The author
WHAT?!??? Your still here? I thought I had gotten rid of you! ....I mean.... How nice of you to be here! While I am still here, why don't I introduce myself? My name is Jason and.... What else is there to say? What's your name? Wait? What's that? You can't speak? That's right! Because you are the reader! Hahahahaha. And guess what? YOU can't do anything to change it! Did I scare you? Oh my! I didn't mean to do such nonsense! Are you okay? There's always that opportunity to leave and stop reading! Maybe I could end this chapter! People ALWAYS stop reading at the end if the chapter! Even you! Have fun putting this down and actually doing something useful! Well.... This is the end of the chapter.
