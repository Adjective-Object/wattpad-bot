DaniI was at Alex house we were chilling and he was mad flirting with me . I played along I like Alex a lot but the thing is he got a girl and she hates me because I'm so close with Alex."Alex you better come to my shoot if you don't I will be so mad at you" I said sitting next to him." I got you babe I promise I'll be there " he said." Okay remember you said that " I said to him." I'm having a pool party you coming" he asked. " Hell yeah I haven't seen the guys in a long time" I said to him." Oh you going just for my friends " he said playing with my hands. " I'm single boo your not" I said laughing. " Oh really you single" he said." Yes I am" I said to him." Then how come we got each other initials on our wrist" he said. I bit my lip and looked at him. " You know there's something more " he said  to me." Alex" his girl yelled ." Yeah babe were in here" he yelled.  He let go of my hand " Oh um why is she here" Maria asked." Hi to you Maria" I said getting up and moving to another chair. " Hi babe" he said. She kissed him with tounge and everything.  I was getting jealous . I rolled my eyes." What was that for" Alex asked. " What do you mean baby " she said straddling him. " Wow um bye Alex" I said. " Let me walk you out" he said getting up. I walked to the front door." Damn you got a big ass" he said." Your girl too " I said to him." But not big ass yours" he said." Stop" I said laughing." Text me when you get home" he said real serious towering over me. I looked at the corner of my eyes and she was watching. I make her mad" Not a minute less" I said. I kissed his cheek and hugged him. " Alexander I'm waiting " she said. I was smiling in the inside " Bye" I said leaving. " Did I tell you I love that dress" he said. " Bye Alex" I said to him.
