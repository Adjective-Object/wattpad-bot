Erin's POV
Jordan destroyed the fridge as soon as we got in the house, "he was the first one in so he could get food and not starve" he explained. There was left over pizza from the night before, crusty, weird, cardboard pizza.
"This is gross, even after heating it up." He said.
"It's floppy and soggy and it's not all at the same time." I said.
"Wish we could have gotten the captainsparklez pizza hut pizza... but they stopped selling that." He said.
"Jordan?" I laughed.
"What?" He asked.
"This is dumb, I'm not eating this."
"Yeah." He said putting his pizza down on the table and sliding it away.
"You know what's better then pizza at the table?" I asked taking his hands.
"What?" He asked.
"Sitting on the couch with you talking." I said.
"Let's do that then." He said.
Jordan's POV
All three of us cuddled and watched a movie of Boo's choice, monsters Inc. Boo and Erin fell asleep... as usual.
"Dad?" Boo asked as I started to stand up, doesn't Boo call her dad "daddy"?
"No, it's Jordan." I said.
"Oh." She said.
"Yup, it's Jordan." I said awkwardly.
"Could I call you dad, you know if you and mom get married?" She asked.
"Umm... I don't know."
"No, right? Could she?" Erin asked yawning and stretching her newly woken body.
"I don't think I would be comfortable with that." I said.
"Okay." Boo said sleepily.
"Oh, it's already eight." Erin said.
"You should start getting ready for bed, Boo." I said.
"Okay." She said standing up in a slouch and walking away.
"I did not expect to wake up to that." Erin said.
"I didn't expect you too either." I said sitting on the couch next to her.
"Shall I pay?" She asked.
"You shall... not because Boo could walk in here any moment." I said.
"Aww, I was looking forward to paying you." She said.
"Oh, then we are on the same page." I said squeezing her and rubbing her arm.
"I love you." She said.
"Yeah, I love you too." I said.
"Good night. I will see you in the morning." Boo said from the doorway.
"Woah, woah, woah, you really think you're going to get away with that?" Erin asked popping up out of her seat and walking over to boo.
"No." Boo said.
We gave her hugs and sent her off to bed.
"Alright, pay up." I laughed.
"Mkay." She said putting her hands on my chest and kissing me. "How much did it cost now?" She asked.
