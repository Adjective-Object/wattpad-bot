So I have this male green anole name Jasper (green lizard)(look it up) and I got him a girl friend...... She was living in my house for a little bit because she was thin and in bad shape. I named her Talia.   So I let her out with him today and Jasper was jumping over the bar to get to the top screen panel (in my pool cadge)  And he did it very well and gracefully and I said "Wow Jasper that was very graceful." Then I started laughing and then crying....... because Jasper for Twilight and vampire from the Olympic coven, the Cullens, and vampires are graceful and Jasper had the same name as Jasper so it was a funny coincidence so I turn to Talia and say "I should have named you Alice.
