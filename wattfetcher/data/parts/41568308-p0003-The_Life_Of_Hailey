Once Zach brought Hailey to her room she put her suit cases on the bed and started to unpack. She put her clothes in the closets and her makeup in the bathroom she had. The room was a light blue with a black trim.
ZACH'S POV
So i sat Hailey down and said "i have to tell you something........it means alot to me." "What is it?" Hailey said confused. "I,I,I like you, you really mean the world to me, and your beautiful." "Awe, i kinda like you too." I started to lean towards her for a kiss. She leaned toward too. We kissed and it felt like the world stopped spinning.
HAILEY'S POV
Omg i just had my fist kiss! It felt amazing my heart dropped. I am happy. "So are we dating or what?" "Yeah i guess." he said
So Zach's mom rang a bell and said time for dinner.She made a pizza by scratch. It was amazing. "My mom was on chopped and won." "Thats so cool!" i said.
