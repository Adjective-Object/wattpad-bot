All they heard was "happy new year," but that was enough of a cue for Andrea to press her lips against Jenn's. She didn't even mind the taste. Most people would've found it revolting, but it reminded her of Jenn. Lauren and Arden were too preoccupied to even notice.
Andrea pulled away, getting up to run into the house. This all confused Jenn, and they could all see that. She came back quickly, with a paper in her hands. She eagerly shoved them into Jenn's hands. Jenn stared at it for barely ten seconds before handing it back. "What is this?" Jenn asked.
"Plane tickets." Andrea bit her lip.
"To where?"
"New Jersey. Then, we're going to go to Pennsylvania." Jenn nodded.
"We aren't ready though, we need to pack."
"Well, we have until tomorrow, anyway. We have clothes packed, we have money, and we have each other. We're as ready as we'll ever be, Jennifer. Just trust me," Andrea said, kissing Jenn's forehead. Jenn buried herself into Andrea's body.
The fire brightened all of their faces, which reminded Jenn that Lauren and Arden were actually there. Along with that, she forgot that it was a new year. It was 2015. Jenn wasn't alone, and she felt like she was with family. That was a first. Andrea massaged her head softly, allowing Jenn to slowly, slowly fall asleep to the sound and warmth of the crackling fire.
She knew this would be the last real warmth she would get before leaving for Pennsylvania with Andrea.
