Everyone agreed with Joss and he wrapped up his speech. We all made a toast and went back to our previous conversations. I was talking with Robert again when I heard Joss calling my name. I turned my attention over to him and apparently so did everyone else.
"Alexis, since you're new, why don't you tell us about yourself?" Joss asked me. All eyes turned to me as I began to talk.
"I'm really not good at this, so ask me questions" Hopefully this would be the last time I would have to tell people about me.
"How old are you?" Gwyneth asked first.
"I'm 13 but will be 14 soon"
"Where do you live?" Gwyneth continued. I could see Chris E start to speak and I knew what he was going to say. Luckily I answered before he could say anything.
"I live in Toronto, Canada"
I could see Chris E glaring at me, so I gave him a cheesy smile. That seemed to shut him up about where I live.
"Favourite sport?" Jeremy spoke up.
"Netflix" I heard a few people chuckle, but Jeremy looked really confused.
"I said sport"
"And I said Netflix" he finally seemed to clue in.
"Favourite T.V show?" Clark asked me.
"Doctor Who, Sherlock, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Big Bang Theory, and N.C.I.S" Clark seemed satisfied with my answer.
The questions continued like this and I felt more comfterable with my cast mates. That is until they asked my the question I was most dreading.
"So tell us your life story"
