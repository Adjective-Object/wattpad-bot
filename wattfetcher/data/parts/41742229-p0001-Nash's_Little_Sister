Katie's P.O.V---------------------------------------------
Hi I'm Katie Grier. I'm Nash Grier's younger sister. None of the boys know I exist. and Cameron, he and I have become best friends over the past 13 years. My 16th Birthday is coming up, and Nash says for my birthday he will Introduce me to the boys!
I have always had a low-key crush on Cameron, and the Hayes and my best friend Gissel are the only people who know!
Hayes and Nash have no clue that i can sing. My YouTube account is me singing covers of the most popular songs. and yes I get some hate and it has gotten to me and the past and caused me to cut but it had been 1 year sense I have cute. Cameron is the only person who knows that I cut. He only found out because he saw me cutting when i was 14. But when I feel like it , I give him a call and he comes over with ice cream.
