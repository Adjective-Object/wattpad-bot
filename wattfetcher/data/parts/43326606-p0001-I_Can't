*Bethany's P.O.V*
"Moving in together finally Omi !!!" I yelled at my very lovely bestfriend Naomi.
"Beth would you be a little more quite,you're screaming won't help my hangover" she said collapsing on the floor.
"Only you would get drunk the night before we moved Omi" I put down the first box by the stairs.
"Please tell me Dylan will come and help us"she said whining
"Dylan can't right now he has to help his mom on something I don't know" I said handing her some Advil.
"Wow great boyfriend you have bethy"she said rolling her eyes
"It's his mom Omi!! Of course she will come first!!" I said screaming to piss her of more.
"Beth shut the fuck up ! I'm starting to regret moving in with you and we have been here less than 10 minutes" she said while heading to her room.
"You love me you little diva!" I said while heading out the door texting Dylan.
To: Dylan ❤️ Babe will you be here later on?
I put my phone in my pocket and went downstairs to my car. Grabbing one of Omi's boxes "Fuck Omi what the hell did you pack?!" I said to practically no one. The box was so heavy I couldn't go upstairs.
"Need any help love ?" I heard a very strong British accent. I turned around to see brown eyes. Tall , kinda muscular, tight jeans and white shirt.
"oh hmm sure" I said blushing I'm sure he noticed me checking him out.
"Number?" He asked when we reached the top of the stairs.
"Excuse me?" I asked not really paying attention to his question.
" number of your apartment babe" he said smirking.
" Ohh ! 465! " fuck! I mentally cursed in my mind knowing the guy noticed me checking him out.
I opened the door to the apartment and the guy put down the box.
"I'm Liam by the way , I live 2 doors down the right" he said.
"I'm Bethany but you could call me Beth" i said before my phone started to ring.
"Hello?" I mouthed a sorry to Liam and he nodded.
"Hey babe just called you to say I can't make it today I'm still at my friend's house helping him out" Dylan's voice ringed through the phone.
" I thought you were helping your mom" I was confused and disappointed he lied to me.
"Oh I did , sorry I meant to say my friend" Dylan answered
"Oh" was all I could answer
"I love you babe I will see you tomorrow" Dylan whispered . I wonder why.
"Love you too , bye " I said and ended the call.
"Umm so would you need help with the other boxes . I can get my some friends to help us out" I totally forgot Liam was there.
"No thank you I will just tell my my friend to help me out , thanks anyway" I smiled at him.
"If you need help on anything just go knock at my door, I live with four of my friends so don't freak if you don't see me answering the door " he said with a chuckle.
"Alright thank you Liam" I said before he left.
"Omi!!! Get your ass here and help me out will you !!!" I screamed as loud as I could
"BETHANY!! What did I tell you !" Omi screamed back.
I didn't reply I was just thinking what could Dylan be doing. And why did he lied to me.
