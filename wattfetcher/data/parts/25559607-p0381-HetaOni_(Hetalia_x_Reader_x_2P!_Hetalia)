Luciano took a deep breath. "Because...like all plans that are believed to be foolproof...something went wrong. Horribly wrong."


"It was those monsters, weren't it?" Francois said, frowning.


Allen started to look pissed off. "Are you talking about Steve?"


"Hm. I think...he means the one that made a ruse with the Italian First Player, not your so-called...friend." Nikolai told him.


Nodding in agreement, Luciano spoke, "Quite frankly, I'm starting to even think that the Thing he made a contract with...wasn'tÂ one of the clones...though that matter is for some other time. But yes, it was that alien-like monster.


While we were trying to figure out how to get rid of the last First Player in the mansion, we ran into that Thing. We all thought that Allen could simply make it obey him without question...but the thing is, he was the one who got attacked by the creature first."


"I was?! But..." Allen's eyes darkened at the thought. He thought that this timeloop was the first time that the clones attacked. Hiding his eyes with his shades, he made a hand gesture. "...Continue."


"Of course, when we noticed that the monsters were starting to harm us and not just the First Players, we fought against them.


But fighting back didn't cut out well.


We ran, we fought, we hid.


But soon, our bodies ended up becoming weaker and weaker.


To the point...where each of you started to fall, one after the other.


Until...."


Luciano stopped and slumped back on the chair, staring at the ceiling once more...trying to hold back something. Emotions? Tears? He doesn't know. Maybe both, but he'd never allow anyone to see that.


Composing himself, he faced them. "...Until I was the only one left alive."


"Impossible..." Zao muttered, clenching his fists.
