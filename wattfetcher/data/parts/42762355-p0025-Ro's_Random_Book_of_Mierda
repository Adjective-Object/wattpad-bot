Tomorrow I shall pack, go jogging and watch the third season of Game of Thrones owo
Yes, this is how to spend your vacation.
I still have to live at home for 25 months. I want to move into a small apartment with one bedroom, bathroom and a kitchen-living room. The municipality will be in Southern Savonia or Northern Carelia. In a city, where I can actually get school books from. Might just as well move in with Janette... After high school I can move to Northern Savonia or Northern Ostrobothnia. I'll study, get a job, find a man. Get kids between the age of 25 and 35. Waste the rest of my life with them, traveling when I can afford it. Then I'll get old and retire. And bother everyone until I'm 83 and die. Sounds like promising next 70 years of my life.
...what am I even writing anymore?
