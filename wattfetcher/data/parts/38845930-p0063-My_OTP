"Jordan, You spent that much on Boo?" She asked.
"Yeah." I said.
"I should probably... give you... actual money." She said in between kissing me.
"Oh please. It's like... my money is yours, yours is... mine, don't we live together?" I asked.
"Yes we do." She said.
"Don't do anything to -- sorry I should fraise that better -- you won't ever do anything too make me not love you." I said, that was partially a lie.

"Come on, pick up." I said to myself worried something happened to her.
"You have rea -- " the voice mail box said.
"Damn it, Erin, pick up." I thought to myself before throwing my phone across the room onto my bed, I put my face in my hands and started to cry thinking the worst.
"What if she got into a car wreak? Or she might just be stuck in traffic... heavy heavy traffic. Or what if something happened, what if she slept with her ex? She wouldn't do that, she has zero feelings for him. What if she's been cheat -- no she hasn't. But what if she slept with her ex?" I thought psycing myself out making me belive the things I said.
