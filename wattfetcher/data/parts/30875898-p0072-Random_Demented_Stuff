Tick tock, on the clock
When will this life stop?
Tick tock, on the clock
A gun or a knife's chop?
Tick tock, on the clock
When will this misery stop?
Tick tock, on the clock
A car crash, or a poison drop?
Tick tock, on the clock
When will this agony stop?
Tick tock, on the clock
You're  dead and in a timeless shock
Tick tock, on the clock
You can't go back, your time has stopped
