Love, what is that, really?
Were I come from on the first full moon in the ninth month we have a festival. There's dancing and drinking. I have never wanted to participate, but I am the only girl who must. The bloodline must be keep pure. Today was my last true day off freedom.
My fifteenth year and I was not looking forward to tonight. Jade weaved flowers into my hair, but to me it was idiotic . The flowers would be long gone by tomorrow.  We left the palace and I walked arm in arm with my mother, Queen Titania.
The square had a large wooden pole in the middle. Ribbons in every color came down from the top of the pole. I saw many village girls standing around. All in soft pastels, to make them seem kind.
The sun was setting. The sky was painted in vibrant shades of orange and pink. Blue at the top it always let you know it was there. Someone started playing a violin.
The girls of age each grabbed a ribbon and we started to weave in and around each other. Left, right, turn, and repeat. Following the movements we finished as the sky became dotted with stars. The peasant blouse I was wearing had fallen around my shoulders. We drank wine and laughed.
In the distance the sound of hooves could be heard. The old women and children went inside. We stayed out on the streets, waiting. I saw men in hooded cloaks on horse back riding towards us. I was thrown on top of one.
He rode so fast that I had to hold on. I could hear him laugh, deep from inside his body. The horse sped up and we turned around going back thru the village square. We crossed the bridge, the one that separated our worlds.
To spit myself I slowly drifted off. Before I faded away I saw a bright burning ball of flame in the sky. My last day of freedom, for a long time now.
Really, that is what, love?
