I was standing beside the window. And I saw something outside.

Outside, I saw two figures standing on the front yard of the mansion.

Those people.... I know those people all too well....Even from afar....I know.....



"M-Mom...? Dad.....?"

What's going on? What's...going...on...?!!



I leaned closer to the window and stared long and hard at the two people who were standing outside, worry written all over their faces. Their clothes don't look the slightest bit bloodied and their body without a trace of a single bruise. All they had were concerned looks and anxious movements, trying to peer over at the windows of the mansion to see any sign of life inside. It seems they're a tad too far to be able to see us, but we were able to see them. I... I see them perfectly.



I see that they are perfectly well.



Without any mark that they were even inside the mansion...at all.



Then, based on my observation...they...they never got to enter the mansion, after all?



They...never...



After all this time....



They were never in any danger......at all?



Never...



They never....



Then....then....
