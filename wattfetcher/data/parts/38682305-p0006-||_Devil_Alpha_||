I turned around, I wasn't that scared. What's he gonna do that's so bad?I explain to him I was just looking around, he said that could get me in the wrong place. Whatever that means. I walk back to the room holding some food Luke gave me. He said I'm not allowed to go outside without his permission! Crazy huh? This is one of the many reasons I want to get out of this place! It hasn't even been a week! I'm not just gonna become his luna and let him control me! I ate my sandwich angrily while watching a episode of pretty little liars. Apparently Luke was doing some work. I tried to think of something I could do, but all I could find was a library. It wasn't big and magical, but it was medium sized.The wood was a nice color and the large desk held lots of paper and drawing materials. I sat down at the desk and started to draw. My hand took over and I just kept drawing like I was in a trance. I drew Luke's chocolate color eyes, dark brown curly hair, sharp cheekbones, muscular body, and his olive skin. "Awe how cute, you drew me!", Luke's husky voice brought me out of my trance. A large grin was placed on his face. Wow. I looked outside, it was dark! He sighed, "let's go to bed."Oh hell no. •••THE PICTURE ON THE TOP IS HER!! LOVE YOU VOTE AND COMMENT!! FOLLOW ME !! NEW UPDATE LATER?
