Here decides the old man,
to visit his old lives,
and to relive his memories
once again.
For,
perhaps he could
understand his mistakes
and learn where he went wrong.
Here decides the old man,
that he would relieve
some of the guilt
that had crushed
his empty heart.
For,
perhaps he could
prove there was more
than a shrivel of love left.
