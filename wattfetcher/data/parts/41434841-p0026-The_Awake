Everyone probably thinks lowly of me. They think I can't figure out anything but death. But I know alternate plans. I know how to survive. I know how to live if I wanted to. But I don't. I'd rather die. I found a good enough reason to cover it up. I was destined for death from the moment I was born. I wasn't getting anywhere anyways.
So maybe Jordan was wrong. Perhaps life can be one big game of poker. And I'm almost out of chips.
I'm cashing in.
