dearest noel,
somehow it was supposed to be heartbreaking.
somehow it was supposed to chatter me from the inside out.
somehow it was supposed to make me ache in pain and cry.
but i didn't noel.
was it selfish?
was it selfish that i didn't feel pain or sadness?
was it selfish that i was happy? that i was happy
knowing
that
there was
a
cancer
growing
inside of me?
