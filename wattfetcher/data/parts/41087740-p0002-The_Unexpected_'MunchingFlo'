"So, do you want to play on Hypixel for a while?" I asked CyaNide. "Sure" he says. I got out of the Skype tab and went into the Minecraft tab. I waited for Hypixel to load. I finally got on and saw CyaNide. "Hey, CyaNide, I'm over here!" I say.
CyaNide walked over to me "Hey! Wanna play a game while we wait?" CyaNide asked. "Yes!" I say as I randomly selected a game. Me and CyaNide played for a little while until I heard Chris say "Okay, hold on"
Me and CyaNide went back to Skype. "Sorry it took long. His lazy booty, couldn't get up" Chris joked. "What was he doing?" CyaNide laughed. "Napping" Chris answered. "Okay, he's on! I'm gonna add him" Chris said as I heard clicking of a computer mouse.
Then, I saw a face pop up. "Hey, Carlo!" CyaNide smiled. Carlo had dyed blue hair and a bit of black hair. He looked tired. "What do you want?" He asked, yawning. His voice was so soft, and gentle! "We wanted to introduce you to Tyler!" Chris said.
"Hi" I say, smiling. I saw Carlo look at me, he was silent for a few minutes. Chris laughed. "Carlo! I think you accidentally muted yourself!!" Chris called out. I saw Carlo, make a confused face and then he un-muted himself. "Oh yeah, sorry" he blushed in embarrassment.
I laughed a bit. He smiled. "Carlo, get your butt on Minecraft!" Chris said. I took off the Skype tab and went to the Minecraft tab. I saw CyaNide and Chris' skin. "Alright, alright" I heard Carlo say. "Okay, I'm on" he says.
I looked around, I didn't know Carlo's skin in Minecraft. "He's here, Tyler" Chris said, as his Minecraft arm was punching a person. The person was called 'CarFlo' and his skin was a mixture of Link with a Attack On Titan uniform.
"That's Carlo?" I asked as I pressed the 'W' to walk forward. "Yeah" Carlo answered as he turned his Minecraft head to look at me. I have to say, Carlo is cute. His Minecraft skin and his face!
I also really like his voice, so soft and gentle. Wait, does this mean I have a crush on him? No, I can't. All the fan girls will be mad at me, if I dated him, and not Adam, Kyle or Ty. "Tyler?" I heard Chris, CyaNide and Carlo call my name.
"Huh?" I say. "You've been silent for a while now. I was starting to think you muted yourself" Chris laughed. "Oh, uh, no" I say, sighing. "Guys, I'm gonna go take a nap" I say. "Alright, bye." They all said. I smiled and turned off my Minecraft and Skype.
I turned off my computer and got up. I walked lazily to my couch and laid down. I closed my eyes, falling asleep.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A/N: so, this story was requested by @_dome-dino_890Hoped you enjoyed it!
