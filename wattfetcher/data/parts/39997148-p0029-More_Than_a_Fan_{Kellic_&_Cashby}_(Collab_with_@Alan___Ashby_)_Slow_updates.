"Hey Vic." He said smiling at me.
"Hey Kellin."
"Killer show."
"Thanks dude, can you hand me a water?"
He nodded and grabbed me one, handing it to me. "So what's it like performing like that every night? Don't you ever get tired? Or are you used to it? What about your throat? Do you like ever get a sore throat from singing so much?"
"Its fun. I'm used to it, I've been doing it for a while now."
"Oh," He said and bit his lip as he stood there awkwardly.
"Shouldn't you be manning the merch table?" I asked and he shook his head.
"Not really well I am but I was actually on my way to get some more shirts and then I saw you so I just started to talk to you and well that's what we're doing now."
"Better go get those shirts then."
He nodded, "Yeah I should. I'll see you later!"
"Yeah, yeah."
Kellin gave me a small smile and ran off to get more shirts, I just shook my head and went back to where the guys were all sitting.
"Hey what are you all talking about?" I asked sitting down next to Tony.
"Nothing really, what were you and Kellin talking about?" Jaime asked wiggling his eyebrows.
"He was just making small talk, really. Then he went to get some more shirts."
"He has the biggest crush on you dude." He said and I shook my head.
"Nah, he's just a fan."
"No, he likes you, a helluva lot."
I shook my head, "I don't think so, besides he's really annoying at times. He talks way too much."
"I think it's just because he's nervous. You should hang out with him so he's not so nervous." Tony suggested.
"What is with you guys trying to hook me up with Kellin?" I asked.
"Because I can just see you two together. You're perfect for each other." Mike said shrugging.
I rolled my eyes, "No. We're not perfect for each other, get that thought out of your head."
"I bet by the end of this tour you two will be dating." Jaime said, "It's inevitable, Mike's right you're perfect for each other."
"I highly doubt that." I said rolling my eyes, "And I'm telling you he doesn't like me, he's just a fan."
"Whatever you say Vic."
"I'm right and you guys are wrong."
"Sure you are." Mike said patting my shoulder.
"Whatever." I said rolling my eyes again. "Can we please change the subject?"
"Sure, sure."
"What do you want to talk about then?" Jaime asked, "Since you don't want to talk about your secret love for the merch boy."
"Really? There is no secret. I don't like him." I huffed.
"Everyone can see it but you. You need to accept that you like him." Tony said getting in on it, "I bet you think he's hot don't you."
"I'm leaving all of you if you don't stop talking about it."
"Quit fighting it and let yourself love him!" Jaime said and I stood up getting annoyed.
