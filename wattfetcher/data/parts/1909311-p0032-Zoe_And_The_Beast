As quickly as I could muster, I grabbed the first boy I could feel and swirled him around to face me. Drunken eyes and a lazy smile looked down at me. Without looking at the face any further, I swooped in and crashed my lips forcefully against his, grabbing his hands and placing them on the back of my waist. I brought my arms forward and raked my fingers through his hair, pushing his as close to me as possible.
I forced him to move to the beat, to trail his hands higher and higher across my body, to shuffle towards where I thought Beast was dancing, all the while we were making out. I could hear him let out drunken groans into my mouth, trying to slip his tongue inside. I forced my mouth shut, just protruding my lips against his.
Suddenly, my body was ripped apart from the guy’s body, a hand knotted in my hair. I could hear heavy breathing coming from beside me, panting almost.
I gasped, bewildered, and looked over to where I thought Beast would be. There, another boy stood with his hands protectively blocking the blonde girl’s view, his face frightened. He was the boy I had thought was Beast.
Wait, that wasn’t Beast?
I had mistaken Beast.
I looked to the guy beside me, slightly shocked to see Vince’s face filled with rage, his gaze piercing straight toward my kisser’s face. I kept my eyes on Beast, shocked, to say the least.
My head snapped back to the kisser’s face, and my mind froze. There, standing drunken and wasted stood…
“Derek,” Beast growled, “How dare you kiss Zoe?”

What had I just done?

A/N
I finally updated! It's been what, three weeks, since I edited?  Dang. Sorry about the long wait, I had a pretty awful writers block. It's better now, though. :)
