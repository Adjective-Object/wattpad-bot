Today I wake remembering it is the last day in Orlando.Now I have 4 days till my 16th birthday.I walk to my suit case and pick out:-Blue dress-Blue flagsI got to the bathroom and take a shower.I then get dressed into the dress and put the flats on.I put my hair in a dutch braid and walk out the bathroom and see everyone up."Mia are we all wearing dresses?"Kenzi asked."I guess so,"I say.She then goes and takes a shower and gets dressed in:
-Colorful dress
-Colorful flats
She had her hair in a dutch braid,also.We then go downstairs and eat an apple.We all eat in silence knowing its our last MagCon for a while.But there all staying at our house.When we finish we walk out and go to the limo.The ride there consisted of everyone on there phones.When we got there we finally started talking."Why are we not talking to each other?"I ask."Because you and I are usally the loud ones,"Taylor says."Oh,"I say."So I'm excited for my birthday,"I say."Yeah me too.My girlfriends turning 16 years old,"Shawn said."My sister,"Nash and Hayes say in unison."Ok so same order as always,"Bart says."Okay,"we all mumble.We go out in excact order,as always.We all do our thing.Then we have time to do questions.Aaron goes into the crowd and finds a fan."Claire.Mia if you couldn't date Shawn who would you date?"Claire asked."Either Johnson or Ethan Dolan,"I say."Natalie.Have you met the Dolan twins?Have the the Dolan twins followed you on social media?"Natalie asked."No I have not met them yet.Ethan and Grayson both follow me on all social medias,"I say."Last question,"Aaron said."Miranda.Are you going to the next MagCon?"Miranda asked."I really don't know,"I say.We walk off the stage and go backstage and do our meet and greet.We finish up with the meet and greet and go eat.All I eat is french fries.We walk o ut the venue and to the limo.The limo ride was short.I was laying across Shawn and Johnson.We get there and I go straight to my hotel room and go get in pjs I get on my laptop and watch Netflix.I go watch "Andrew Zimmerman Bizarre Foods of America" my favorite show.He is in Texas eating at the barbecues in Dallas.The episodes over in no time when I start dosing off.When I fall asleep I rember tomorrow we leave back to North Carolina.I get to see my sister,Skylynn.
