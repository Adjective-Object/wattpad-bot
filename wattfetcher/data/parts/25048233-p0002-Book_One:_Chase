“Don’t call me psycho. I’m Pearl, nice to meet you!”
“I don’t care what your name is, Miss Psycho! Why did you bring me here? And why did you handcuff me? What the hell?!”
“First of all, it was you who asked who I was…” Yeah, I kinda’ asked that.
“Second, you’re here because I wanna’ ask you some questions...” What is this? A freaking court room?
“And lastly, you need to cooperate if you want to be released from these handcuffs.” The fuck is wrong with this girl?!
“Are your screws loose young lady? Why would you do this to me? If you want me to answer your questions, then you could’ve just freaking called me?! You know – normally?!” I was not scared at all. I was raging on what was happening. My clothes are now dusty and my hair is messy. What the fuck am I supposed to do once I get out of this freaking hell?
“You’re Ice, right?”
“Damn right you are, Miss Psy-…” What?! Did she just call me, Ice? “What did you say? You called me, Ice?!”
“Uhm, unless you are deaf or something, I remembered calling you Ice.” This missy is getting to my nerves. All these things are happening to me because she’s mistaken me for Ice?
“I’m not freaking Ice! I’m Chase, dammit’!”
“What? This one dude told me you’re Ice. Hmm… Maybe, I got it all wrong.” What the fuck?
“OMG? Are you kidding me? Are you really serious? You did this to me without confirming who I was first? Are you freaking serious?!” Good thing I was handcuffed, or else I would’ve punched this annoying girl already.
“Heh-heh. Sorry! Bye!” She gave me this impish smile and hurriedly ran outside the room.
“What the fuck? At least unlock these handcuffs for me! The fuck?!” I was left stuck on a dusty chair inside a dark, abandoned room. The next thing I knew is that I woke up inside the school’s Clinic.

==========================================================
Back to the present. I am so glad I managed to escape that heck of a psycho. Whew! At least I made it to first class in time. I’m currently a Second Year student here at ArchCross High School. Last year was kinda’ hard because I had to work my reputation up the ladders. I was successful at first but then this Ice managed to snag first place at the end of the school year. Tough luck, no?
First period is English, my worst subject. The uber-beautiful Miss Bloom entered the room with nothing in her hands. Prolly’ not gonna’ teach anything today. I’m guessing introductions?
“Class, stand up. Show Respect.” I led the class to stand up and greet Miss Bloom a Good Morning. I’m the Class President, by the way. You’re automatically made President if you finish the previous year with the highest rank on your class. The good thing is, I’m not in the same class with Ice or else I would’ve been just a regular student. He’s currently the Student Council President though. Damn, why do I keep on comparing myself with him? I need to focus here!
“Good morning, class! Sit down.”
