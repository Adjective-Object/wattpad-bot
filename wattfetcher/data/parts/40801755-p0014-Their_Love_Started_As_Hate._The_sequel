I stopped, "really?" His Adam's apple bobbed up and down, and he nodded, "she's 3 now," he smiled thinking of his sister, that's cute, "my mum she hated that man as much as me," "we are happier now, he didn't even say sorry for the way he acted, but what should I expect we don't live in a movie,"
I was ready to cry, I felt so bad, not because I broke up with him during this time, but because he never told me, "can I ask you something?" I said stopping yet again, "yes sunshine anything," he smiled, "do you not trust me or something, why didn't you tell me this," "because I didn't need to drag you into this, I couldn't let anyone know about my past, I couldn't just build a wall for no reason for to let someone break through so easy," "you didn't need to know until he passed,"
"What? So when this was happening i was clueless, maybe we shouldn't date because, it seems you are keeping secrets from me and big ones at that," I said and stormed of, I wasn't letting my feelings for him show anymore, that asshole can shove my middle finger up his ass,
I stormed past my aunt Jen that was waiting by the lobby and I went straight up yo the hotel room, I scanned the key in shoved the door open, I just want to scream, that's it I'm calling my dad, i grabbedMy phone from my pocket and went to his contact,
Daddy Bear ðŸ’•
*ringing*
"Hello, what's up kiddo?" "Dad, can you pick me up from portrush, I don't want to stay here anymore,""Uh, well I can't, I didn't think you would be coming back so I invited over the Rodgers," oh no he didn't, why would he invite my ex boyfriends family over?"And why did you invite them over?" "Well me and Ronald wanted to catch up so I decided that you where gone I could invite the whole family over," At this moment I heard screams and shouts in the background, "common City," I heard Ronald shout, "city till I die," I heard James shout my dad then shouted "QPR are shite on my shoe," I rolled my eyes,
"Well I'm not staying here,""What changed your mind?""Mark rider changed my mind, did you know my aunt Jen was letting him stay with us?" I heard him sigh,
"well I'm not coming for you," "Can you ask James?" I pleaded, me and James where actually quite good friends, he still kisses my cheek and comforts me if I every need him to, it all happened last year, it's quite wired talking to your ex boyfriend about a boyfriend but we where only 16, I could even consider him a best friend,
I heard mumbling and then a sure, "okay James is coming, what hotel?" "Loughside view" "Okay hell be there soon,"
We said are goodbyes and he hung up,
"Emily, sweetie what's wrong?" My aunt Jen said, I spin around "n,nothing," I stuttered, she sighed, "your leaving there has to be something wrong, is it mark what happened?" "Auntie Jen it doesn't matter, I'm leaving and James is coming to pick me up," I said walking over and shoving my shies in my suitcase, I zipped it up and say on the bed.
She left obviously deciding, it would be better for her to leave, I went onto my phone and read for a while, I checked the time and it was 7:27 James should be here soon, I grabbed my suitcase and dragged it downstairs,
I could hear Harley my aunt Jen and Mark talking with each other, when James walked through the the doors, I haven't seen h sconce last summer, it only dawned on me how much I missed him, he was there for me through thick and thin, his eyes land on me and he smiled showing his pearly white teeth,
