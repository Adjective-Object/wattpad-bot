Author's Note:Hey guys, so I believe that I shouldn't be nervous about doing this since I already have three books in the making, but I can't help but think that you won't like it as much as my other books. Well hopefully you like it. Bye and let's get started.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stiles' POV~
Why couldn't he just reschedule the pack meeting instead of making us come in the storm. If your wondering who he is, he is Derek Hale. Derek is a werewolf, and the Alpha of the Hale pack. In his pack is Scott, Allison, Isaac, Lydia, Jackson, Danny, Boyd, Erica, his creepy uncle, Peter, and last but not least, me, Stiles Stilinski, the scrawny, pale human of the pack.
Anyway back to the subject at hand, Derek being the demanding idiot he is wants all of the pack to go to his house in the storm. Like who the Hale does that, see what I did there, never mind you have no sense of humor.
When I finally reached the Hale house, I parked my blue jeep, that first belonged to my mom. I got out the jeep and out of nowhere, it started raining.
Great just my luck, note the sarcasm.
I walked to the porch and knocked on the door, waiting for someone to open the door. It felt like forever until someone opened the door. Hopefully it isn't Derek because I don't have time for him.
When the door was opened, there at the door, speak of the devil, was Derek, with his permanent scowl on his face.
"What took you so long Stiles?"
I looked at him and responded with my usual sarcasm, "Oh you know just visited Santa Claus and the Easter bunny for coffee."
Apparently he didn't get it because he grabbed me by my shirt, which was soaking wet from the rain, brought us inside the house, closing the door and slammed me into the wall, getting all up in my face growling saying, "Don't forget who I am Stiles. I will tear out your throat..."
Before he finished his sentence, I finished it for him saying, "Yeah, Yeah with your teeth. I've heard it all before."
He released me quickly like I had burned him and looked at me with shock.
I looked away and walked into the living room.
Everyone else was there sitting down in their own conversation, until all conversation stopped when I stepped in.
Awkward moment or nah?!?!? Sorry I'll get back to the story.
I cleared my throat and said with as much enthusiasm I could muster up, "Heylo guys!"
Oblivious to the tension between Derek and I, they all said hi back cheerfully, including Jackson.
"So what are we doing in today's pack meeting?"
Lydia answered my question with her usual sass, "We don't know. We were waiting for you to arrive."
Rolling my eyes, I said back, "Well I'm here now, so how about we play games first, then watch two to three movies. What do you think?"
Everyone agreed to it and Erica suggested Charades, so she went first. While they were splitting up into two groups, I went into the kitchen to get snacks.
I managed to find chips, chocolate chip cookies, and various types of soda. I was so caught up in making the snacks that I didn't notice Derek creep into the kitchen behind me.
When I turned around with the snacks and drinks in my hand on a tray I screamed loudly because I didn't know Derek was behind me.
