UNKNOWN P.O.V
I walk out of the airport heading towards a taxi that I stopped .
Carrying a basketball in my hand , I head inside and tell the driver of my destination .
I yawned and stretched my arms before I politely asked the driver "ano excuse me , do you happen to know where seirin high school is located ?".
"Yes of course it's just a couple of blocks away from your destination." He replied .
I smiled and said "thank you sir."
After I arrived at the building I paid the taxi driver and went inside the empty apartment .
"It's been a while , hasn't it? " I muttered .
I opened my phone and saw a message from my mother in English saying 'have you decided on which school you'll be attending ?'
'Yes I have .' I replied and made my way towards the bedroom . I threw my stuff on the couch before laying on my bed .
I look at the ceiling before saying with a smile "I can't wait to play ."
