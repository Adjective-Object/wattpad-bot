he walked in the room. He looked around and didn't see anyone in the room. He rolled his eyes,
" young master were are you?" He asked looking around in the hall. He sighted then went to the kitchen to make the young masters breakfast.
" Sebastian, is my breakfast ready yet." Said a 13 year old boy walking in the room.

" CIEL!!!!!" said a girl as she ran to hug him.
" lizzy  please get off of me." Ciel said raising his voice. She sniffed a little then said, " ciel, why don't you like me". Ciel looked up at her and felt pity for her for the first time.
" he does like you he's just not in a good Mood right now." Sebastian said putting his hand on her shoulder.
" I understand." Elizabeth said look down at her feet.

I was walking down the street from the black butler con, I just changed out of my costume. For the con I was finni, everyone has to love a little bit of finni. So, I was walking down the street then I saw a light at the end of the stree, a normal person would just ignore it but I was no normal person so I walked to it, when I walked in I was in some town. The town was familiar but I couldn't remember when I have seen it. I turned around to see the "portal" closing when it closed a small box was in its place I picked it up then sighed and put it in my pocke. So I was there walking around on the side of the street then somehow I fall well trip over a rock and when I landed I couldn't get up. so I was there just sitting on the side of the street crying my head off and everyone keeps looking at me the keeps walking.
after a while this girl that looked around my age that had blonde curled hair with a pink dress on walked up to me.
" are you ok?" She asked then i recanized her I was lizzy.
" I don't know but I think I am." I said looking up at her. She helped me up but I fell again I couldn't walk my leg was sprained. She looked at me," I will go get some help, stay here." Lizzy told me as she ran off. A few minutes went by and she came back with a a tall man he was about 6 ft tall.
" Sebastian, can you please help her?" She said looking up at the man. OMG standing right in front of me was the best butler ever Sebastian, my heart melted.
" oh corse my lady." He said picking me up. He took me to a careg and set me down on the seat. After he sat me down lizzy followed and sat down next to my. I looked up and saw ciel sitting there infront of me looking at me surprised .
" Sebastian, who is this?" Ciel asked with a stronge tone.
" I'm April, April William." I said because I know Sebastian doesn't know my name, " whats yours?" I added knowing the answer.
" this is ciel and I'm elizabeth, you can call me lizzy," lizzy said with a smile.
" nice to meet you both I hope we can be friends at some point." I said with a smile, " I'm guessing that the butlers name is Sebastian?" I added trying not to squel with excitement.
