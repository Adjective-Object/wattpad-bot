Every puff of that damned smoke made my lungs hurt.
It was better for my lungs to hurt than my heart.
That was cliche.
Everything about my life was cliche.
I was still running from her.
Her laughter drifting through the hallways.
Why was she laughing?
What was so funny?
I finally made it to my favorite hiding place.
The library.
The quietness surrounding me immediately.
Her hard breathing breaking the sacred place.
With that never ending laughter.
I turned on her suddenly.
I had never been more angry.
So frustrated.
So annoyed.
So mad.
So irritated.
"Won't you just shut up?"I spat angrily.
"I'm not talking last time I checked."she said.
She was panting trying to draw in breaths.
Suddenly she whipped out an inhaler taking a hit from it.
"You have asthma?WHY WERE YOU RUNNING AFTER ME THEN!?"
She grinned.
Her teeth perfectly white.
"Cause it's fun."
That was her simple answer.
"Fun?Really?"
"You ran I chased.Like tag."
"You are a mad women!"I screeched.
This was probably the most interaction I'd had in like years.
"Your voice is hoarse.Why is that?"she said ignoring my previous words.
"Um it just is."I coughed.
"Interesting.So  you were born with a hoarse voice?"
"Not exactly."
She was coming uncomfortably close to me.
I backed into a bookcase.
The back of my vans scuffing on the bookcase.
"Um can you scoot back."
"Claustrophobic much?"
"Actually yes."
She backed up immediately.
"Well that's bad."
"No sorry?"
"I hate taking pity."
"Yeah."I said.
Damn these memories sucked.
I hated this.
I hated her.
I hated these memories.
