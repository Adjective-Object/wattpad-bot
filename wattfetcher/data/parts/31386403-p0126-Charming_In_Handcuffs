"Jack, there was a group of kids so drunk that one of the guys decided it would be funny to pee in the middle of the gym. Another guy thought he was Tarzan and failed to swing with a paper streamer and dislocated his shoulder."
Jack started laughing, probably reliving the memory. He was drunk off his ass too while he encouraged both guys to do what they did. There were many other faults at that prom, but those were the ones that stuck out the most. And I only went to that prom because of Lindy and she went to the one being held for my school.
I have to say Lindy's was more entertaining.
