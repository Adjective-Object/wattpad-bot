"I'm not regulating her intake." Law whispered.
"DON'T DO THAT!" Robin shouted, throwing an empty bottle at him.
"Stop it! He's mine! Law-sama's is all mine!" Hancock cried, holding onto Robin.
"Oi, let me go." Robin said harshly pushing Hancock away.  In the other side of the room, a drunk Chopper was riding on top of Bepo.
"You're supposed to be a running! You're a horse asshole!"Chopper scolded. Bepo merely replied with an 'aye.'
"Oi Oi, Chopper to?" Haruka asked looking  around before his eyes settled on the drunk blonde in front of him.
"Sakura?" He asked. Sakura just kneeled there and stared at him.
"What do you want?" He asked, not knowing that her vision had started to distort.
"Ah! There are two Harukas. Yay!" Sakura sang with hearts fluttering around her.
"Sakura, there can't possibly be two Harukas." Nami answered before she started laughing like a maniac again.
"This is utter chaos." Ace and Haruka muttered.
In the next villa, there was a drunk supervisor and his equally drunk crew.
"There's something n in Villa 4. Shouldn't you check it out?" Benn Beckman asked.
"No way! This party is on flick! YOLO!"Shanks yelled flinging a bottle of sake in the air.
Back to the others.......
"Here, Law-sama. Drink with me." Hancock cooed, pushing her breats against Law's arm.
Law sweatdropped, "No..wait a minute."
"Law-sama, you didn't look at me in my swimsuit all day. I felt lonely."
"Eh..N..Hold on."
"But if you won't drink with me then, then yu might as well squeeze me to death!" Hancock cried squeezing Law.
"Somebody...Save me!" Law screamed.
Meanwhile....
"Hold on, why is she mad at us?" Ace asked.
"Dunno." Zoro answered.
"Who told you to speak! Sit!"
"We're already sitting!"
"Kneel!"
"We're already kneeling."
"Oi Luffy. When did you get so muscular?"
"I'm Zoro!"
"Whitebeard, when did you get so tiny?"
"I'm Ace!"
"Why did you talk back. Screw that! I'll kill you!" Robin exclaimed, somehow getting one of Zoro's swords in her hand. Ace and Zoro just shivered in pain.
Haruka was just standing there with a laughing Nami behind him.
"Ne." Sakura greeted, causing to turn around.
"Here's a sausage roll. Say 'ah'."
"That doesn't suit your character!" Haruka shouted. Sakura immediately disappeared into a corner and started growing mushrooms.
"You're mad at me."
"Huh?" Haruka asked sweatdropping.
"I just wanted to feed you the sausage roll. The sausage roll." Sakura cried.
