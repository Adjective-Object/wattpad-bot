Shea's P.O.V ~play the song above~
"Seth" I whisper as I look at him. I feel my heart brake in my chest. Casper warned me he was going to make Seth pay for all those girls he stole from him.
I looked at the love of my life's face, it all bloody and bruised. Gosh his perfect face. This is all my fault!
I feel myself just completely brake inside.. I watch the look on Ashley's brothers face. Its not happy, its not smug. It looks like he feels sorry for us.
"P-Please try and wake him.." I mumble through tears, the cloth still in my mouth. He nods and gently starts to shake Seth. I watch as his electric blue eyes flutter open.
He looks around, so confused. His eyes then lay on me and I feel my heart rate quicken. Oh what i'd do to just hold him..
"Shea..?" He whispers as he looks in my eyes. I watch as his eyes widen and a huge smile forms on his lip. "God baby! Look at you! What did they do to your beautiful face!?" He says angrily, trying to get his hands free. I watch his eyes fill with tears as he looks at the condition I'm in. I begin crying as well.. Noticing how much his face is messed up.. His nose all bruised and bloody, a cut right under his eye brow, and nail scratches on the side of his face. Im going to murder that bitch!
"God Seth i'm so sorry" I mumble through tears. He looks over at Ashley's brother.
"Calvin! Fucking untie her mouth please! God damn you know you're better than this!" I look at Ashley's brother.. So his name is Calvin..
He walks over to me and slowly undoes the cloth. I just look at Seth and cry. "This is all my fault. If I wasn't such a damn slut none of this would have happened. God Seth I want you and only you.. I love you Seth" I let out, tears just falling. He looks at me.. I can tell just how much he wants to comfort me.
"God Shea I love you too" He whispers, tears falling down his face as well.
"Shea.. Seth i'm so sorry.." Calvin whispers. Hes not as much of a bad guy as I thought. "Ashley's my sister and she has so much shit on me.. I'll try and get you guys out of this.." Right as he finishes saying that Ashley starts walking down, following the feet of who I suspect to be Casper.
"Well look at who we have here!" Ashley laughs as she looks at the both of us. "The two love birds!"
"Ashley shit the fuck up" Seth sneers.
"Casper you know what to do" Ashley says with a smirk. My eyes widen as he walks over to me. He smirks as Seth as he grabs my face. He kisses me hard and not how he used to. I feel nothing. I don't kiss back. I try my best to escape it.
"Fucking get off of her Casper!" I hear Seth yell. I watch as Casper pulls away and I spit in his face. He slaps me and hard and I hear Seth yell and move around.
"This is what you get Seth! You're going to regret fucking me over so much with chicks! It seems Shea means the most to you! So im going to take her away from you! So you can feel like shit every day knowing you lost her!"
"Now boys behave" Ashley laughs. "Shea how does it feel to be fought over? Huh? Haha don't worry sweet heart it'll be over soon and all you'll have is Casper"
"Don't touch Seth I swear to god. Do what you want to me but don't fucking hurt him. Because I will kill you with my bare hands Ashley. You know I will" I say angrily at her.
"Keep going Casper" She laughs as he starts to undo my blouse.
"Casper stop fucking stop! What the hell are you doing!?" I yell at him, his lips start kissing at my cleavage. "Casper stop!" I yell as I start crying.
