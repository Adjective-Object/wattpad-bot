Jenn definitely went out, though. She refilled her sleeping pills and antidepressants, she bought clothes, she went to therapy, but she 1. didn't want to tell Lauren and Arden and 2. couldn't tell them. They'd try helping her, and fail at it, and she'd feel bad for them. She just figured that the best way to not have to feel bad for people was to never put them in the situation in the first place.

"I'm getting admitted?" Jenn asked. "It wasn't on purpose, I swear."
"Jennifer," the doctor started, "people don't accidentally cut their wrists. Paper cuts are accidental, cutting your finger when you're cutting a fruit is accidental. This isn't."
Jenn sighed. "Fine, alright, but I won't like it."
"Oh, I wouldn't make that conclusion so early on, Jennifer. You might make friends." The man smiled. He reminded her way too much of her dad, although he was never truly in Jenn's life when things actually occurred, he still told her encouraging things. "You might make friends" was among them. Jenn remembered that, but also remembered how her father left when times were hard, and left her to face things on her own.
"I won't 'make friends.' I'll meet people, but I don't want to hang around people like me after this," Jenn stated, slumping down against the wall behind her. She was still scarce of clothing, only wearing a hospital gown.
The doctor winked at her, yet Jenn perceived it to be less creepy as others would've. "You'll find people. Trust me! So, anyway, Jennifer, we'll get you in whenever you feel ready."
Jenn thought about Lauren and Arden, who were waiting anxiously, and then about Kalin, who was clueless about Jenn at the moment. Her mom and dad popped into her mind -- She hadn't talked to them since she left Pennsylvania for Los Angeles, but she remembered what happened before their great dispute: Her parents told her to be happy, or at least try, and she did. Jenn sat up confidently, saying only one thing, "I think I'm ready."
