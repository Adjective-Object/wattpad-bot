"Just get out of here! I thought I could trust you Leena! Just get out and never come back!"
The sound of my step sisters voice was cycling through my head, as I slowly woke up from my dream.
I sat up and noticed that I was sitting in someone else's bed, and that I was in someone else's room. Where the heck was I?
I got up and began walking around the room I was in. And let me just say, it was pretty big! It had a huge closet, a bathroom, and a full body mirror next to the door.
"Steph? Hello?" I whispered into the bathroom.
There was no response. I walked into the huge hallway and called out for Steph again. There was still no response.
"Hello?!? Is anybody here?!" I screamed into the empty two story house.
At that moment four guys ran from downstairs and were just staring at me. I stood there awkwardly not knowing what to do. I looked at them and I had absolutely no clue who they were.
"Who the heck are you people and why am I here?" I yelled at them.
They looked at each other with confusion.
"Okay, who brought the girl home, and why is she in our guest bedroom?" Asked a tall guy with light brown hair.
As he asked the question two guys came through the front door. One boy was tall with dark brunette hair, and the other boy was short and had dark brown hair with blonde highlights. To be honest, they were both pretty attractive. But anyways back to the story. The tall boy with the dark brunette hair answered the other boy,
"Calm down Ricky. Jc and I found her on the sidewalk by our house, and lets just say she was drunk as heck."
Me? Drunk? I've never been drunk before, let alone drank any alcohol. I mean, I'm only 19. I have no clue why I would be drunk on a freaking sidewalk.
"So you two brought me here?" I asked the two boys by the door.
"Yup us two brought you here. And by the way, I'm Kian and that over there is Jc" he said as he pointed to Jc.
Well now that I've figured out how I got here, now I just have to figure out why I was drunk on the sidewalk.
