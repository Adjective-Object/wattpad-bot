Ethan POV
I wake up as I see Emily leaving I say "Good Morning,where are you going?" She says "To the bathroom can I have my privacy I already fuck you." she smirks. I say "alright alright‚úãüèª" she does that as I bury my head in my pillow. Her phone dings. I look up to see who it was it was Jake. Who the fuck is jake! I say to myself. I unlock her phone as I know her password he types on I message
Jake- hey baby doll what you up to? I haven't seen you in a while I miss you.
Miss you! Fuck no!
I run to her and ask "who the fuck is the bitch!" She says nothing i then demand "who the fuck is this bitch tell me or I kill you!" While smashing her phone. She watched in awe. She then replies "you wouldn't dare! Then who would be your sex buddy and you have to fucking buy me a damn new phone!" He replies "that girl who I saw in the kitchen the other day I'm gonna fuck her. In her p*ssy and watch her be pleasured." I said this for her to tell me like it would be a threat but she had no emotion. She looked heart broken.
