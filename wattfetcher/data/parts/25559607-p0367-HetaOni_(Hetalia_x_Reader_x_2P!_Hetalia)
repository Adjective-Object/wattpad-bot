Gently settling the girl on the ground, I turned around...and almost fainted.



There were monsters just across us.



Large, grey, alien-like monsters of different shapes and sizes.



"WH-WHAA.... WHAT ARE THOSE??!" I exclaimed in a strained voice, torn between fully screaming and hushing down because of the horrific creatures.


(Name) turned to look at the creatures and tilted her head. "Oh? Those? Relax, they're in that prison-thingy, I don't think they'll get us."


"Y-You're serious?" I asked, a look of disbelief prominent on my face.


She nodded. "Yeah! Now, c'mon. Let's go downstairs. You don't like it here, right?"


"Obviously...F-Fine...Let's leave this room." I told her, taking her right hand and leading her to find a door.



When we finally found a door, we entered the next room. It felt as eerie as the other one. This time, it had blood on the floor...that seemed to be like numbers. How strange can this house get. I knew I should've asked Oliver and the others to explain more to me before they had that long meeting.


Soon, (Name) and I walked down flights of stairs. As we walk through the halls, I felt like I've already known this place before... It feels all so painfully nostalgic. (Name) stayed quiet for most of the time, other than humming a few nursery rhymes and stuff. When we reached what she said to be the second floor, I heard faint voices from the other hall.


"Uh-oh! (Second Name), let's go hide!" (Name) told me, tugging my jacket.


I raised an eyebrow at her. "Why?"


"Because I might lose the game if it's the 'it'!" she said, frowning.


This made me more confused. "I have no idea what you mean by that."


Pouting, she crossed her arms. "Wellâ€”-oh no!" the girl exclaimed, panicking as we heard the footsteps coming closer. (Name) suddenly dashed into one of the rooms.
