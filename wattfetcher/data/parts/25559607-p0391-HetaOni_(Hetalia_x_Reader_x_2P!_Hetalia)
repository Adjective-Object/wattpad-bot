I slowly lifted his blanket a little to check on his injury. His shoulder was bloodied, his jacket looked torned quite a bit, too. Could he have been...bitten by the monster? Well...at least he's getting his rest. His breath doesn't look laboured, thank goodness. Thank goodness...




Thank goodness, my brother is still alive.




I sat on a bed that was beside America's and took in a deep breath. Why did I have to see such horrible things?


We succeeded with our task back in the past, but it looks like the task here in the present was at a much higher cost. It's taken a toll on everyone, even America, too. It seems the annexe was holding more danger...and mysteries, after all.


Wait, that reminds me, were they not able to find...(Name) in the annexe?


I walked over to the kitchen, where England was. Tapping his shoulder, I spoke, "Uhm, say...England..."


"Oh, Canada. What is it?" he inquired, putting away the kitchen utensils he was about to use for cooking.


I felt a slight wave of relief at the thought that I was able to discontinue him from cooking. Shaking the thought off, I faced him. "Did you guys see any sign of (Name) being in the annexe?"


"I'm afraid not. We weren't able to explore the place for long, since the monster attacked us. Terribly sorry." England told me, looking down.


Shaking my head, I spoke, "N-No, it's not your fault, anyway. I'm just really worried about her..."


"As do I. Sadly, it's not like we can do anything about it at the moment. I mean, we don't even have a means of communication with her." the Brit said, sighing.


Communication?


Like...a phone...perhaps?



"Wait!!! I—I actually do have a means of communicating with her! I have her phone number!" I exclaimed excitedly at the realisation.


England crossed his arms. "Hold on—How come you have her phone number?"
