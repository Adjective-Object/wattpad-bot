Flowing black fabric caught Ayden's eye and he noticed that Jade had gotten up. She was making her way over to the ships ledge. He followed her inquisitively. She stopped and placed her hands on the protective railing. He caught up to her and did the same.
"What now?" Ayden asked. We need a game plan, or we're as good as dead.
"The water will start making its way onto the deck soon. We need to get--" Jade was interrupted by a little boy hollering mumbo-jumbo and waving his arms through the air. Ayden was able to pick out the most important thing he said though.
"The water is coming! Mama, the water is coming!"
They followed his accusing finger and wasn't disappointed by his claim. The ocean was in fact ascending upon the deck, swallowing it hungrily. Ayden turned back to Jade. "Okay, we need to move now!"
"Any ideas on where we're going though? We can't stay here, we need to get off somehow!" Jade was beginning to panic again. Perhaps it was because this side of the ship was slightly darker than the rest.
Ayden stood there thinking hard about a game-plan. The only thing I can think of is . . . it's the only way. He took a deep breath before looking intently at Jade. She gave him a questioning look and opened her mouth to speak, but Ayden quickly silenced her with lips. It only lasted a couple seconds, but it was enough for him. He wrapped his own pale fingers around hers before explaining the plan.
"We're going to jump. Got it?" Ayden really hoped she wouldn't deny the idea.
She nodded, much to his relief. Ayden stepped onto the ladder-like rails, climbing up and over until he was hanging on with his back to the ship. Jade followed suit with a little help. He looked at her for a moment, tightening the grip on her hand. "We'll be okay. Just . . . don't let go of my hand."
"You don't want us to get separated in the water?" she asked.
Ayden shook his head. "We can find each other easy if that happens. I have my own reasons. Just don't let go, okay? Please."
Jade looked at him curiosly before looking down at their connected hands. Looking up to his face again, she tightened the grip even more. They gave each other a curt nod before looking down at the water.
And with that, their feet left the railing and they began plummeting towards the black, icy waves below.

Unless she somehow got resurrected or Finn swooped in on a wind glider and caught her, she ain't comin' back.Video: Alesso - Heroes (We Could Be) ft. Tove Lo.
