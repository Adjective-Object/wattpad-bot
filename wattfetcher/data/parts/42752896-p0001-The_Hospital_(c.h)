Dakota's POVI sat in same room I sat in everyday.
Looking at the gray walls that used to be shiny white. Looking at the hospital bed I looked at everyday.
That held my strong loving sister. My sister who was 7 Years old. Her name was Alice. No hair. Bright blue eyes. They were so bright they were scary. "Dakota.." My sister called. "Yes love?" I said, all of my attention on her. "Can you sing me a song". I smiled. "Of course! What song?"
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow!" She cheered.
My smile grew wider. I began the song and finished it. I sang delicately. She clapped. But when she stopped clapping. I still heard noise. I looked behind me to the door and there stood. My brother. The one that left us so many years ago. Luke Hemmings."Who is that?" Alice asked scared. "That's our brother Alli, his name is Luke" I said and glared at him.
