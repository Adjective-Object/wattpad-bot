Inside she was a wreck,
When you see her she looks perfectly fine.
Deep down her mind is a mess,
When she is with you she looks happy.
When she's alone, she is fragile,
This girl is full of dreams, she wants to escape her town,
Meet new people, travel,
Explore the world, and
Go on fun road trips
At midnight
And perhaps one day
She'll be truly happy.
And when you ask her "Are you okay?"
For once she'll say, "I'm fine."
And it wouldn't
Be a lie
