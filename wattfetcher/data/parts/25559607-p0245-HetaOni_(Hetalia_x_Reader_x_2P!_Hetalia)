As I was already in front of bathroom, I heard a voice from the other side of the door.
"See? Just as I said, wasn't it?" someone said in a low voice.
I furrowed my brows. "A voice?" a muttered to myself.
"Yeah, but he literally woke up. Anyway, [he] will work for [us] until [he] dies. You do know that we have no such... service as compromise, right?" I heard the voice grow cold and sharp.
Beginning to recognise the voice, I turned the knob and entered the room. "What?" I let out as I saw the man on the other side of the room.
It was Russia.
He turned around and gave a surprised look on his face. "Italy..."
"R-Russia..." I replied nervously, not knowing how to exactly react.
I saw him slowly place his cellphone back to his pocket. Giving me a suspicious look, he spoke, "How unusual of you to eavesdrop! Oh, but you're all sweaty. Did you come to wash your face?"
"But I didn't hear anything at all..." I started, but shook my head. "Who were you talking to? You said some disturbing things---"
"It's none of your business who I talk to on the phone, is it? I'd appreciate it if you could leave me alone." he snapped, cutting me off.
I creased my forehead, and took a step back from seeing his intimidating aura. "Do you have something to hide?" I asked, sensing something off about him.
"You did, too, remember? You never told us anything." he told me coldly, his tone hinting irony and sarcasm.
I was taken aback by what he said, but I needed answers. "But--"
"I'm free to decide how I deal with my chess pieces. Oh, but... it doesn't seem to be very useful. I have to find the next piece quickly..." Russia said, walking towards the door.
With my gaze following his figure, I called after him. "Russia!"
"... Go wash your face already." he said before slamming the door behind him.
And at that, I was left there in ear ringing silence.

From what I presume, it was already early morning, and everyone was already up and about when I woke up. The futons were all arranged, some were already cooking something up in the kitchen, some were chatting amongst themselves, others were polishing up their weapons and the rest would just sit somewhere around the room, giving themselves some breathing space and thinking time.
"Well, then, now we can contact the outside world, so we also need someone to stay here. Something like a control tower." Japan said as he stood up from the chair, seeming to be prepared to venture around the mansion once more.
Germany nodded and looked at us. "Incidentally, it seems that that monster also goes outside, so those out there are in for a hard fight, as well. Austria has informed us that they have dispersed and will take care of it all at once."
"M-Mom...Dad..." I choked out as I remembered that they were out there, still in danger from those monsters.
Spain walked up to me and gave me a reassuring smile. "Ah, don't worry, chica. Austria and the others will protect them!"
"The whole world is gathered here. In other words... we are united with the whole world right now." Germany informed us.
