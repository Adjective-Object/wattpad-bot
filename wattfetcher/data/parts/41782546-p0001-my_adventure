I am Max a typical teenager 14 if for typical you count a mutant freak before everything happened(will get to that later ) we soon descovered that we have wings and grow powers ocassionly we are 98 percent human and 2 percent avian and by we I mean my flock angel 6 nudge 12 gazzy 8 and fang and Iggy both 14 like me.
We were getting chased also by mutants these things were called erasers. They work for jeb my step dad I hate him so me and my flock are run aways we have since I was 12 years old we had a mission to save the world.  my flock has been sleeping In a cave for the few nights meaning I had to find a new place me being the leader and all.i finally got tired enough to want to go to sleep then suddenly I see Dark sploches on the ground. UT-oh erasers I tells everyone to get up fang gets up really fast Iggy since he is blind but has raptor hearing also automatically gets up angel and gazzy and nudge also we all get ready to fight suddenly we attack since we are really strong it was easier to take them down but even with are wings (I think I forgot to mention that )  and strength dont take erasers down easily I take a hard blow to my nose blood gushes through it I hold it and fury boils inside me I knock it down check out the flock and see that they have been holding down their positions I go to help fang who is getting majorly hurt I kick the eraser of him and fang yells "duck" but I heard him to late an eraser Kicks me down and kicks at my ribs suddenly I heard a crack and boy did it hurtI've never never really experienced pain like that but I got my feet and hit the eraser hard until it ran away the rest of the erasers left to so I supposed that eraser was the leader so we're leaving so I checked my flock angel said "good "so far nudge and gazzy even though they had bruises and cuts they were very strong kids and said fine so were the others
