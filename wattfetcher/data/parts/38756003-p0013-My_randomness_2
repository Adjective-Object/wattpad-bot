heyo my Halo's, Angel here. and I am back??? what???? that is soo weird. I am posting for once!! I know srry guys . things came up and I have good reasons. if you don't believe me then  you can even ask @elsasings1237 and she can clarify things for you cuz she is my best friend. why I didn't update on sunday: my internet went down and I couldn't update . the week:i had a math and science test this week and had to study. Friday: ahhh the good old Friday, the reason why I didn't update yesterday was there was a dance going on in town and @fuzzycat2022, @elsasings1237 and I were invited and it went till 11:00 pm and by then I had a headache, my feet hurt from standing for aroung 3 hrs at the grad and 5 hrs in the day and my computer was dead and I couldent find my charger    oops O////O. this is just a quick update letting you all know what went on and no I didn't die if u were wondering. well this is Angel, and I will see you all later byee:)
