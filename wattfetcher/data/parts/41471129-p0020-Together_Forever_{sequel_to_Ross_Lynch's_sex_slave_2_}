THE END
Quote of the day : "You say you love me but yet you keep hurting me"
I know that I ended the book waaaay to soon and the ending sucked but I have a reason for my actions. As we all know summer is close, I won't be able to update in July. Not even once, my family and I are just gonna spending quality time with each other and I want to use that time well. I only get to see my mom three months per year anyway.I won't be writing another part to this book, but for everyone who has been reading from the first (RLSS) book, I would really appreciate it if you just left a comment about your experience with it. :)Toodles!!
I'll be posting the epilogue real soon so...yeah
