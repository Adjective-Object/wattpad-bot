"My real name is Wanderer" she said
"And you choose to live here?" I asked she nodded. "Fighter Wanderer."
"Excuse me?" She asked
"Fighter Wanderer. That's what souls call the other souls who don't agree with there lifestyle. Who rebel against there own kind"
"Wanda is anything but a fighter! She wouldn't hurt a fly." Someone said Wanda huffed and glared at the person who said that
Ian chuckled.
"It doesn't directly mean violence. More like peaceful rebellion" I explained
"But your not peaceful. You attacked me with a knife" Jessie said and pointed to the fresh cut.
The blonde bimbo glared at me and I gave her a fake smile.
"Yeah they call violent souls, defective souls. You can be born with it or you can turn it to one. If your born with it there's no turning back. You can't get rid of it. But if you turn into one you can always turn back. I was born with if bThere's something wrong with me" I said
Wanda put a hand on my shoulder and Ian tensed
"There's something wrong with all of us" she whispered and laughed a little
I smiled
"Can I have the knife?" She asked
I looked down at the knife that was being held in my cut hand that was wrapped with a towel.
The towel was now stained red. I cringed and so did Wanda.
I shook my head
"Defective souls always carry weapons. It's there lifestyle." I said. "I won't use them. Unless someone attacks me"
"Okay" she said and sunk back into Ian's opening arms.
"I would understand if you don't want me around her" I said to Ian. "I am violent."
Ian just nodded and Wanda rolled her eyes
"Come on Pierce" Jeb said
"It's Pierces" I mumbled as I followed him through the long dark corridor
