Heyyy guys! So how's the first chapter? Is it good so far?
Sorry if it sucks, I'm only 12 and but I love writing and this is my very first fanfic I'm going to write. I hope to get better throughout this fanfic and as I get older. If you have any questions, you can comment down below, or you can ask me on Instagram or Twitter.
