OKAY THIS STORY WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED "MY REVENGE WILL BE SWEET" BUT I MADE SOME SERIOUS CHANGES AND NOW IT IS CALLED "IN NEED OF A CHANGE". THIS STORY PLOT IS WAYYY DIFFERENT THAN IT USED TO BE. BUT THE SAME EXACT CHARACTERS WILL BE IN THIS NEW EDIT TOO. Updates will be slow considering that I am modifying the whole story. In this new edition Raven does not get rejected nor runs away. Oh and if you have any questions on the characters just leave a comment or message me and I will try and clear it up the best that I can.
