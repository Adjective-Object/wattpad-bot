"You look cute in green" Simon said, "Huh, yeah right. I look like broccoli" Simon laughed, "If you hate it so much, why are you wearing it then ?" He smiled widely, "It's one of the few things I have left" My eyes widened when I realized what I've said, "What ?" He raised an eyebrow in disbelief, "Kidding. Now to the point, what do you want ?" I was not going to tell him about the secret admirer who threw almost all of my clothes and gave me new ones which I gave away too.
"I'm making this surprise for my sister for her birthday and I don't know what to get her, so I came here to get her something nice and came across your pretty face and thought of getting your help" He's so sweet, getting his sister a present and making a party for her.
"Cool, did you think of something ?" I asked, "If I thought of something why would I come and ask for your help" He slapped my arm playfully, "HEY HEY ! Don't cross the lines ! I see you're getting pretty much used to me ! You are nothing more than a person that I owe a service to. You're not even a friend OKAY ?" I almost screamed, "I'm sorry, didn't mean it" He frowned, sadness doesn't look good on this pretty face, I'm getting upset.
"Girls like perfumes, make up and dresses .. fancy dresses" His face shined, "My sister likes your taste in clothes, she keeps talking about you clothes and style all the time" He smiled, "Really ? I'm glad to hear that" I smiled.
We roamed the whole store searching for dresses until I liked one of them, "Look, this will look good on her, it will reflect the whiteness of her skin" I pulled a short red dress with a huge flower on one shoulder, "Naah, it's to short and sticks to the body, I want a long and not so sticky dress" My eyes widened at his words, "What ? I don't like my sister to show much ofÂ skin" He frowned.
My legs ached from walking and my hands almost broke because of the many things I pulled and folded again and again because Simon wasn't pleased of them. At least We picked a perfume.
"What about this ?" Simon pulled a long sparkling golden dress with long sleeves, It was the most beautiful dress I've ever seen, "It's beautiful" I said, "Try it in then" Simon said, "What ?" I raised in eyebrow, "You and my sister have the same size, If it fits you, it fits her, I don't want to surprise her with a huge neither a small-sized dress" He passed it to me and I headed to the fitting room.
"Did it fit ?" Simon asked but I was to busy looking at my reflection on the mirror to answer. The dress was perfect, it fitted my perfectly, I felt like a princess with all those sparkles and glitter stuck to the dress making me shine from every corner.
"Leena are you- Woah ! you look great" I saw checking me out from head to toe, "How dare you" I slapped him hard and pushed him out of the room, "I-I'm sorry, I thought that something happened to you because I called you 10 times but you didn't answer. I changed my clothes and wore my original ones, "Take" I throw the golden dress at him and took my bag then headed to the exit, "Stop, I-I'm sorry" He blocked my way, "I wasn't supposed to agree on helping you" I changed my way but he blocked me again, "I'm sorry I swear I'm not going to do it again. What can I do to make it up to you ?", "You can get out of my way and let me through" I left Simon in the store and was about to go home until ...
I was taking the way out until I passed by a pet store, the name of it was so familiar ...
