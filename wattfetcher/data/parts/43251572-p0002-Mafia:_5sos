"Hey dad" I said walking in the door
"Aliana!" My dad called engulfing me in a hug
"Why are we moving" I asked angry
"Business" my dad answered
"What business! I don't know where the hell you and mom even work!"
"Aliana follow me" my dad said walking towards the basement
I glanced back at Zayn who had a smirk on his face.Â They knew something I didn't and I guess now it's my turn to find out. We arrived in the basement and we were now standing in front of a bookcase. My dad pulled a series of books out until the bookcase moved. We walked in to the room.
"Welcome to the family buisness Aliana"
"What is this place" I whispered looking fearfully around the room filled with guns and other weapons.
"This is the mafia"
