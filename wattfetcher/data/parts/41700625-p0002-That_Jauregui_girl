( 20 minutes later of driving)
I fell asleep on the way to the airport."Meeks wake up!" Taylor shouted while shaking me.I got out of the car. My eyes are barely open. Taylor and my parents are really excited to see my sister. I mean I am it's just that Lauren and I kind of have history. Last time I snapped at Lauren because she says I spend more time at the softball field than at the house which is probably true.
We get into the airport and almost got attacked by like twenty teenage girls. I sat down and almost fell asleep when someone touched the back of my neck.I turn around to see Camila."Micka!!!" She screamed as she jumped on me."Onward steed." She said as I gave her a piggy back ride to the others."Meeks!!!" Lauren jumped on me causing Camila to fall off of my back."Sorry Camz didn't see you there." Lauren said as she hugged me."I missed you so much kiddo." She said as she messed up my hair." Missed you to Lolo."I said as she released from our hug."Let's go." She said. She looks happy a little to happy it's scary."Bye Camz!" Lauren yelled as we walked out of the airport.
(A/N|Bad chapter because I wrote this and only slept for a hour. I promise to write longer chapters that don't suck as bad as this one.)
