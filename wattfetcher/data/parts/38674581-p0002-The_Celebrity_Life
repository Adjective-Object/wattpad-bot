"Okay. So." I say awkwardly.
"Why are you acting so strange? The only time I saw the Madison I know and love was just now, when you were using your fandoms to scream bloody murder at me." I giggle at his statement.
"I-I"
"Wait. I-I need to tell you something. I'm, kind of, maybe, you know... moving." my jaw dropped.
"WHAT?!"
"I know, it's sudden, but I'm moving to Beverly Hills."
I stared at him in disbelief. That makes this more urgent than ever. I work up the nerve and I say, "Than there's something I need to tell you. I-" I stop with the sound of a door creaking open, I assumed that our parents came. But when I came to the door, I saw the one and only Allison Meyer.
"Where is my boyfriend."she stretches out the boyfriend part and I wince.  She knew. She knew and yet she did it. And yet she ruined my life. Why aren't I pretty? Why am I not good enough? (cue little mix XD) That little snitch. I wanted to slap her so heard the entire world her screams slowly, but surely. So hard that- Whoa. I scare myself sometimes.
"He's in here." I say quietly. She shoves me and struts towards the room that Daniel is sitting in. This was our special place. Not hers. It was where I came to clear my thoughts. Where Danny and I have most of our conversations.  There is no way that, that thing is coming in here.
I turn my heel and go into the room where Danny was sitting only to find them hugging and crying into each other's shoulders. She makes Dan happy. I can deal with her. Yeah. Once again, I turn and quietly show myself out. Jealous, no. Heartbroken, maybe.
(A/N: How was it? I worked really hard on this chappie! Feedback?, PM moi. Have a great day my dazzlings!
Just because you don't have a prince, doesn't mean you're not a princess.
