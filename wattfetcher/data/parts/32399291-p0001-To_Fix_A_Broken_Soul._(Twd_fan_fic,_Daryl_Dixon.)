'Run'
That's all I do now, my feet hit the hard concrete road, it's either that or the sound of twigs breaking under neath my feet. My lungs burned wanting air and begging me to stop. But my mind told me to keep going and to not give up.
'Run'
I cursed under my breath as I took a chance and looked behind my shoulder. They were falling back, except a couple, which were to close for comfort. I grabbed my mothers katana and swung it chopping the rotters heads clean off, there body's hitting the ground. "Dumbass keep running!" I hissed talking to myself. I turned the corner seeing an abandoned city come in view. I didn't realise I have been circling Atlanta City for so long.
'Hide'
I looked at my surroundings seeing the rotters stumble into the city where I currently was. Some have vanished which left about a dozen of rotters left. Why did I come here!? More rotters are in the city! If I had the energy I would of taken down the whole bunch of them that found me in the first place, but I was gonna collapse sooner or later. I ran into an alley way blocking it off with a couple of trash bins and the weak gate that was still in position. I yanked my hand away when the rotters found me and banged there dead flesh onto the wire. I grabbed my fathers knife and killed them off as fast as I could so they wouldn't attract any others.
I wiped the sweat off my face as I continued to run down the alley way. A door at all?
I thought to myself as I stopped to catch a couple of breaths. My eyes scanned the little alley way until I found a ladder. Better than nothing right? I adjusted my bow and arrows and made sure my knives, guns, blades and backpack were all secured so I could start the big climb. My shaky hands held the metal bars for life as I pushed myself more up. I looked behind my shoulder and took in the city. I was at the edge but I could see things clearly. And by the distance of each buildings, I could carefully jump my way over them. It couldn't be that hard, even if it was I would die trying, that would be better..
I sighed shaking my head to shut up my stupid evil thoughts. I reached my destination I crawled away from the edge and fell to the ground. My breathing at different paces, my heart beating at a high rate. My spun as everything caught up to me. I spun myself over to my back looking up to the cloudy sky. Sweat soaked my face and clothes. I groaned taking all of my weapons off of me.
(My 2 guns; one in a normal holster on my belt and another attached behind my back on the belt. My 3 knives; my fathers big beautiful hunting knife he gave to me when he pasted away which was also on my belt in its case and the other 2 from when I was at the marines which were hiding in my boot and also with my gun at the back of my belt near the gun. I shoved them in my bag and took off my quiver full of arrows and my mothers sword with my bow. I was pretty loaded; the katana was tightly in my quiver which hardly moved around so it was easy to get to. My bow was either on its holster attached to my quiver or in my hands.) I placed the big weapons down and put the smaller ones like the guns and blades in my backpack. I got out the squirrel I found in the woods and stabbed it with my smaller knife I use for throwing. I picked up the pieces I liked and ate the squirrel raw. It would of been better skinned and drained an actually cooked but I got this, that was the best I could get.
I wiped my bloody hands on my dirty ripped up black jeans. My long sleeve was still in good shape thank god, if I ever to come across anyone I can't let them know my past, that's why I've survived this long.
1- I don't trust anyone.
2- I've restarted my life, no more abuse.
