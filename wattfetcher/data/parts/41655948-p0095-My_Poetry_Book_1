You're the early sunrise, And the midnight black. You're the girl, In which beauty is something you will never lack. You make me feel at home. I wouldn't go back Even if I could. Staying up to see the stars with you (maybe not physically) Has given me inspiration beyond description. I wish upon the moon That it'll take me closer to you. I love you. - (m.m)
