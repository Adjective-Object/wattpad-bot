Lukes P.O.V~~ I do love her, a lot. Everyday I regret what I did to her, and my wolf blames me for that. Every day he tells me 'You ruined our beautiful mates trust', or 'she's never gonna love us again.' I haven't had any time to talk to her, or make up with her. Some rouges have invaded our area and it's been hard to keep Maria safe and my pack safe. Last night, was one of the worst nights of my life. My wolf wanted me to do something but I couldn't, I didn't know what to do. Her dream must have been horrible, she started screaming and I tried to shake her awake. She kept mumbling 'help' in her sleep! I know it seems impossible, but it reminded me, of me when I was a kid. I had horrible night terrors, I would sleep walk,talk.etc.. It was the worst thing in the world, so seeing my mate in that much pain, killed. My beta (Fransisco), barges into my office quickly. His brown hair fall over his eyes, he hates it when that happens but we all (the pack), make fun of him for it!! He didn't pull his hair Away so I knew this must have been a real emergency!"Maria's gone."Sh!t.
