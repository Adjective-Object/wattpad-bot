So I like to act things out. Okay? Okay. Feel free to call me a mental person after this.
So yesterday I wanted to perform or act out a break up scene... But I sadly had no victims, I mean I had no acting companion, to act with me.
Just when I was about to give up my dog came.
I thought,'Why the hell not? No ones watching.'
So I thought I should tell you guys how this went:
(I kept a straight face through all of this because of my amazing acting skills)
~~~~~~
Me: look look at me, please I'm sorry, this is important look at me.
My dog: *keeps trying to escape and refuses to look at me in the eyes*
Me: I know I'm sorry it's just I really need to tell you something
~time lapse to five minutes later~
My dog: *looks at me*
Me: thank you! Now I'm sorry to say this but we need a break.
My dog: *looks away*
Me: no please don't be mad it's just- just that people these days don't like it when female dogs date girls...
My dog: *moves away*
Me: *sigh* I still love u okay?
My dog: *licks me*
Me: okay!
~~~~~~~~~
So that's what I do when I'm bored and drink soda.
Yeah...
~insert rude comments here~
*sigh* I'm ready.
Nico: okay no seriously wtf were u doing!!
Me: uh breaking up with my dog! Duh!!!
Nico: #foreveralone *sighs*
Me: WE CAN EMBRACE THE REJECTION TOGETHER!!! :D *spreads arms out*
Nico: I'm not that desperate.
Me: D: why you gotta play me like dat?
(yeah I prounoced it,'Dat' instead of,'That')
Nico: *backs away slowly*
Percy: *whispers* I advice you to go faster...
Nico: *runs*
Me: ):
Me: ),:
Me: D,:
Me: whatever I'll just embrace the rejection alone then >:{D~
{ sadly I still don't own Percy or Nico Rick does but someday I will.}
