"Almost noon. I have an interview soon then a photoshoot. Then a signing, then soundcheck and a show. Its a busy, busy day."
"Oh it sounds like it." I sighed, "I think I'm just going to work on homework until the show tonight or something."
"Okay. Call me if you need me. If I don't answer I'm probably at the interview or something."
"Alright, have fun." I said and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.
"What that's all I get?" He whined.
I smiled and gave him a kiss.
"Vic we're gonna be late!" Tony shouted.
"I'm coming!" He called back and smiled at me, "Don't stress out too much okay?"
"I'll try. See you later."
He gave me one more kiss and a smile before walking away and I heard the bus door slam shut behind him. I sighed and looked around the now empty bus. I really didn't want to work on school work I would much rather hang out with Alan or some of my other friends I've made on tour but I need to get this grade fixed pronto.
It was my number one priority at the moment and I couldn't let anything distract me. Especially when I had an F. I can't believe I actually got an F. I couldn't handle an F. This was terrifying. I was a straight A student. I can't handle anything but A's. I've never had an F before in all of my life but right there staring back at me clear as day was a disgustin F. God I'm such a disappointment.
I had to fix it. There were no if, ands or buts about it. I sighed and opened my computer once more and got to work on my homework making sure that it was A worthy material. I couldn't turn in anything less or anything more. It had to be top notch. It had to be my absolute very best. Especially if I want to stay on this tour.
Me staying here with everyone depended on my grades. I couldn't mess around anymore. So I started my first assignment and got in the zone. What felt like just a few minutes later my phone started to ring.
"Hello?"
"Kellin you do realize that the concert starts in less than an hour right?" Vic said through the phone.
"What?" I asked quickly shutting my computer and getting up.
"Yeah, we're at soundcheck right now."
"You can't be serious. I've only been working for like thirty minutes." I said shocked. I looked around and put Vic on speaker phone as I started to get dressed I was still in my sweats.
"Baby its almost six... You've been working all day."
"Oh damn." I muttered, "Alright I'll be there to set up soon don't worry."
"The merch guys have already started you better hurry."
"I will I am I'm getting dressed now!"
"Oh really? What are you wearing?" He asked and I blushed.
"Shut up." I mumbled pulling on some jeans and almost falling. "Oh shit!" I squealed trying not to fall on my ass.
"Babe- are you okay?"
"Yeah I'm fine, I almost fell but I'm okay!"
"Okay well just get in here. I think Marcie is gonna fuck up the merch stand."
"What is she fucking doing?" I asked and pulled on a clean shirt.
"Something with bracelets."
"She better not touch any of it." I seethed and finished getting dressed, "I'm on my way and tell her that if she touches one fucking thing I'm going to murder her."
