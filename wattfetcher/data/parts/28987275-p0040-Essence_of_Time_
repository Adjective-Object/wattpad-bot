"Oh. Okay. Well, thanks anyway," I said, deflating significantly.
I was about to walk away, but Brandon said, "Hold up. I do remember seeing something. There was a man lingering by one of the picnic tables near the magic show's setup. I'd asked him if he wanted to see the show, but he said no, said that he was waiting for someone. No one ever showed up, and after you started looking for your sister, the man disappeared."
"Could you describe him to me?" I asked eagerly.
"Um... He wore black sunglasses, a gray sports coat, a white dress shirt and gray slacks. He had gray hair, and I think he was in his early forties," Brandon informed me.
"Did he have any distinguishable characteristics?" I asked him. "For instance, a tattoo, a limp or facial feature?"
"Not that I recall," he said. "But he did get called on his cellphone; his ringtone was that song... Takin' Care of Business or something."
I instantly recognized the song title. "Yeah, that's it. By Bachman-Turner Overdrive," I said, and Brandon nodded. "So, is there anything else you can tell me?"
"No. I'm sorry I couldn't help you more. Good luck finding your sister, though."
"No, you helped me a lot. Thank you so much," I said. Brandon nodded and returned to his table while I hurried out of the school building. I got in my car and sighed heavily before sliding a tape into the slot. As I drove back to West Brook High, I thought about what Brandon had said. The man had been standing there, waiting for someone, but it was far more likely that he'd been waiting for my sister to fall through the bottom of the disappearing act box. I bet that man was supervising the operation to make sure everything ran smoothly.
Of all people, why would they kidnap Savannah? She was only thirteen years old, and she wasn't some kind of freaky genius. Our family wasn't rich like the Ellingtons; the kidnapping of Alexis Ellington at least made a little sense, but Savannah's abduction made none.
