Ugh! This is so frustrating. But, I'm just going to follow what I think I should. After our business here in the room, I'll talk to the 1Ps about trying to settle things with the 2Ps once and for all.




I mean, Japan did say it himself.

The Second Players didn't mean to bring chaos and havoc--they've only done such acts because that's how they were created.





That's their circumstance.




That's how they were created, so of course they'll have no choice but to do the things they did in the past.





But what about the present?





They're searching for revenge. I've heard their story, already. After thinking about it or so long....isn't it just natural?





They're 2Ps, true...but they're people, too.





Of course they'd be angry at what the First Players did to them. I mean, the 1Ps didn't even seem to have talked to them decently.





They've made mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes. Big mistakes, great mistakes.
