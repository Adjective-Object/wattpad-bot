Sam's p.o.v.
Me and Amanda stayed there talking for hours until it was dark and we had to head back. As I got home I heard crying coming from my mom's room, I walked in and quickly dodged a lamp that flew by my head.
"What the hell is happening?!?" I screamed as my mom tackled me down, she checked me for injuries before she brought me to the bathroom where Liz was and locked the door.
"Whats happening is that dad said he was coming to pay us a 'family-oriented' visit today." I subconsciously pulled the sleeves of my coat down, why would he choose now to visit out of all the times. Things were finally getting better.
