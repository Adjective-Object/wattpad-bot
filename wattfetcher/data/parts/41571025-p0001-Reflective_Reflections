Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock kept on getting louder and more obnoxious the longer I ignored it. Finally, at eight o'clock, I rolled out of bed with a thump. I opened my curtains and made my bed. Then I did the usual morning stuff-teeth, shower, hair, breakfast, and then walked to the bus stop. On the ride there, I finished my homework (a German worksheet) took a small nap until Lianne plopped down next to me. "Hey, Lia," I said wiping the sleep from my eyes. Lianne, or Lia, had the bluest eyes and straight brown hair  that went only a bit past her chin. She wore green oval glasses around her eyes. "After two months in Italy all I get is a 'hey'? I really expected better of you, Emmaline." She shook her head. "Sorry!" I gave her a mammoth hug. "So how was Italy, anyway?" "Oh it was a complete bore. I had to be homeschooled by my dad since my enrollment papers got mixed up. My mom was out by sunrise and came back for dinner,bringing italian food for my dad to study, but then she went out again for pictures in the dark." Lia's mom was a photographer and her dad was a cook. Her mom got a job to photograph Italy for two months and her dad was thinking if starting his own Italian restaurant since the closest one to our city was almost 30 miles away. "Wow. But what about the food?" "Well that was okay."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Beep! Bee- Today was the day Lia was coming back from Italy! I happily jumped out of bed, too excited to make it or open the blinds. In the mirror, I saw my reverse-reflection (or RevRef) walk toward me. "Oh, no," I thought. I matched my RevRef's walking pace, but thankfully she didn't touch the 'mirror'. I walked into the bathroom and simultaneously got ready while protecting. (Who puts a mirror in her shower?) Then after breakfast, I ran out of the house and to the bus stop. I finished my homework right before Lianne got on the bus. "Lia! How was your trip? Did your mom get enough photos? Is your dad building his own restaurant?" Lia laughed. "Calm down, Emma. Or must  call you by your formal name to get you to behave, Emmaline?" "Fine," I grumbled. "Well to answer your questions, the trip was boring. My mom was almost always away, and I got home schooled by my dad. My RevRef kept on looking at the mirror in the study room. It was annoying!  So in conclusion, my mom got enough photos, and my dad's eight-eight percent positive that he's opening a restaurant." Now it was my turn to laugh. "What about all the sights to see and the food?" "Well I went to all the sights the first day, but the food was good."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The day went by quickly. Before I knew it, it was fifth period history. That's where all of the fun stuff happened. Our teacher, Mr. Walker, began the lesson with a picture. It was a picture of two hands holding a camera. "What do you think this person is trying to capture?" Kelly raised her hand. "He or she is taking a picture of their camera?" "Look deeper, my dear. Trevor?" Kelly's face fell. She was always trying to suck up to teachers. Mr. Walker paused by a student who was sleeping. "What are your thoughts?" "Uhh..." Trevor looked at the board. "Well, based off of Kelly's answer,  they're trying to take a picture of their camera so people don't forget how old things look like." Mr. Walker was taken by surprise. I'm sure he was planning to give Trevor a detention for not paying attention in class. "Um, good. Good." Our teacher cleared his throat. "Anyone else? Anyone? Okay, but how do you think this picture was taken? You can't take a picture of what you're trying to take a picture of, can you?" Lianne's hand shot into the air. "Miss Bartisko?" "Well the photographer used a mirror, of course. They would have angled the mirror, or themselves, so that their face wouldn't have shown." "Impressive! I would like for you to take the last forty minutes of class on your devices (this earned a big cheer from the rest of the class) researching (collective groan) mirrors. I would like a two page essay, front and back, by Friday. Have fun." I stopped by my locker on the way to lunch. "Hey Nathan, do you want to join Lianne, Hubert, and  I in the library for a working lunch? We're planning to get some books on mirrors." Nathan was tall, about 5 foot 4, with jet-black hair and dark brown eyes. His locker was diagonal to mine. Guess who had the top locker? Me. "Sure. Wait, why mirrors?" "Oh, that's right. You have sixth History after lunch. Well, just come with us. You'll be glad you did." Nathan shrugged. "Why not?"
