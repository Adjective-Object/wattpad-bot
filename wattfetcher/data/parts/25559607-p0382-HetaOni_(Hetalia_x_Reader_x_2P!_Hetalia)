Looking away again, Luciano spoke. "Si, it did sound impossible...but it happened. It almost drove me mad. Ah, but...since the time of this place is completely off-wire...when I walked around the house, I passed by my First Player counterpart...along with a large clock. He didn't know I was there, and I couldn't think of anything else I could do....


....I followed him in going back in time.


The next thing I knew, I was back to where we started...and all of you were back....alive.


But we were doomed to repeat what we planned in this house for loop after loop."



Lutz shook his head, gaining Luciano's attention. "There are still so many things that are left unanswered. You don't have proof. I mean...I'm not saying you're lying, but...you can't expect us to understand everything just by that alone."


"I understand that, but it's not like I can magically give you back your m—" Luciano paused. He remembered something he hid away a long time ago. Facing his comrades, he spoke, "Actually...I think I can. The question is, would you accept it? Your memories of the past time loops?"


"Of course, we'd accept it." Flavio answered, placing a hand on his hip.


Luciano hardened his stare at them. "It could drive you all to your limits on insanity, you know."


"Fratello, what's going on with you? Have you forgotten?" Flavio asked, furrowing his brows.


Raising an eyebrow, Luciano gave a low hum. "Hmm?"





"We don't have limits on insanity. We are insanity."
