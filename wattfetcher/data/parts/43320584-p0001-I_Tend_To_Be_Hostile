Asher leaned against the wall,waiting for his friends to arrive.He was always the first out of his group;well almost first.Andrew would always jump him from behind,hugging him,which Asher was nerve very found of,but he allowed Andrew to hug him,since Andrew adored hugs."Ashy!"Andrew hugged Asher from the front,almost hugging him to death.Asher absentmindedly smiled at his friend."Yes,Yes,hi Andrew."He said.Andrew let go of Asher and stood by him,smiling."Are you happy we only have 1 more week of school then next year we head of to high school?"Andrew asked,excited.
