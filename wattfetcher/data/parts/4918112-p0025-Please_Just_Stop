I didn't mean for that to go that far... but it had a point. The only reason One Direction is so popular is because of looks. Answer me this: What if one of them had zits? What if one was a cripple? What if one looked like the Hunchback of Notre Dame (no offense to him)? Would you still love them then? Of course you wouldn't. This is why I've refrained from looking at pictures of Three Days Grace. I don't need to see them to know they're amazing. They're lyrics are enough for me. And the album covers. Those rock.
And I can bet you anything that I take less time on my hair than Harry Styles does, and I'm a girl.
-The autotune is painfully apparent.
I have a wider vocal register than all five of those guys combined. Meaning I can go higher AND lower than they could ever hope to. And I'm a girl. And my voice is el natural, whereas there are spikes of autotune in their voices. Trust me, I know what autotune sounds like, in minor and major amounts. It's laced everywhere in their music. If you ask me, it's shameful. If you can't be authentic, then don't fucking sing. It's that simple.
Anyway. This has made me realize just how much I hate today's music... So mission accomplished.
And again, if I get hate, I'm just deleting your comment. I don't have time for your shit.
