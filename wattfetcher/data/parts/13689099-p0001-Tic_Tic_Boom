It all started when I was five. I didn't know it then, but it was the beginning of my absolute worst nightmare. The blinking and coughing. Then when I was eight and the stretching started. I always felt the weirdest need to dramatically stretch my sides. Twisting my entire upper body as far as I could over and over, day after day. Then, just a short year later, my screams were loud enough to be heard. I was reading a good book while laying on the couch. I sucked my cheek in on one side and bit down. It felt oddly satisfying. I did this again, harder and on purpose. I continued to bite both my cheeks. I finally stopped, feeling relived, then realized I had a copper taste filling my mouth. I don't know why I did this. It just felt right, I needed to do it or I would never feel right again, that was terrifying. I thought that was just some episode. It was the weirdest experience. But then later that night, I bit down again, it seemed like I couldn't stop.

Well now that you know how my incredibly boring story started, we can get back to the present day. That was all five years ago anyway. The freedom of the summer is coming to an end. I'm starting my freshman year of high school, with more of my favorite, people. There are two smallish middle schools around here. They both go to the same high school because there is no other choice. So there are twice as many judgmental bitches as there were before. If you aren't their clone your life is worthless and they will stop at nothing to change everything about you. If you're bad enough, they won't even try to change you. They go straight to trying to make you feel like a weird, worthless, monster. But here's the catch, I didn't need bitchy teenage girls to do that for me, because I already did it to myself.
