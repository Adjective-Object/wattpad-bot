Tris P.O.V
My memories are confusing but I remember waking up at the sound of Tobias crying over me.As i opened my eyes Tobias gasped."You're alive."He said as he hugged me.Then I blacked out.The next time I woke up I was laying in a hospital bed.Tobias sat beside me holding my hand as we waited for the nurse to arrive."Well who knows how you survived but you can go now" said the nurse as she walked in.As Tobias and I got ready to leave the nurse came up to us again."One more thing I forgot to mention...you're having a baby" she said.I looked over at Tobias and he seemed happy about it as I was.Once we got home he hugged me and then asked me to marry him."Yes" I replied without hesitating.Then we decided to tell Christina, Shauna, Zeke, Uriah,(he also survived) and Caleb the news.Then we found out that Christina and Shauna are also expecting a baby.So for the next few days Tobias and I spend more time together.************************************Comment, Vote, and follow if you'd like.
