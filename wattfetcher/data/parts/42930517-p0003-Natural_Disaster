'Is this what it looks like everywhere?' Ali wondered to herself.
She pulled out her phone, which only had 40% of its battery left. It was nearly ten o'clock at night. Ali put her phone back in her pocket and looked up at the sky. The color of it barely ever changed. The storm clouds that constantly covered it were dismal and gray, making everything that much more depressing.
Ali put her hands in her pockets and kept walking, scuffing her feet on the ground. She wanted to get as far away from home as she could, hoping that it would ease her mind. Deep down she knew that she was just trying to distract her thoughts from what had happened, but it also surfaced a lick of hope. Hope that she could be safe, just like her mother wanted.
Eventually she found a quiet, secluded area. It was the ruins of a giant house that provided the perfect shelter in case it started to rain. She curled up underneath a stone roof and leaned against a wall. She wanted to cry. Wanted to cry herself to sleep, but she couldn't. The feeling of sadness had taken over, but something inside of her wouldn't let her succumb to the tears. She knew that she was strong, but right now, all she felt was weak.
She began to fall in and out of sleep. She would close her eyes and drift off for an hour, only to wake up again. The lack of sunlight made it very difficult to tell how much time had passed. She had just began to doze off again when she heard the sound of rocks being kicked across pavement. Her eyes snapped open and she held her breath as she listened to the sound, over and over again. Peering out into the open, she could see two beams of light moving across the ground. Flashlights. One of the beams traveled over to the lean-to she hid under, and she hoped that whoever it was holding the flashlight couldn't see her. The beam moved away, then returned to its spot right in front of her. She held her breath. Then, the footsteps started making their way towards her.
