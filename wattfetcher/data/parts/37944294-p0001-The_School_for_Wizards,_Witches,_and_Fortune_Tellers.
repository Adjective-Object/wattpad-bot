Sixth grader Flixen, was walking home from her last day of school for the summer. Every summer day she had the freedom to do anything and everything, well if her parents agreed too, she felt like the Americans after the Revolutionary war. It felt good to relieve the school stress of homework and assignments for a while and let the worries hang free.
"Flix! Wait up!" Her friend Minnie came panting into view as she ran towards her. A smile painted across her face from the news of pain free days of the summer weather and days. Her long slender legs made it look easy to run. Minnie was had the skin color of an exotic person with a cute button nose with deep hazel eyes that complemented her tall figure. It was the complete opposite of her. Flix was a short light colored person with red sleek hair that was normally kept in a neat pony tail. Big blue eyes made her small defined nose look even smaller. Rosie lips pulled into a smile as her friend approached.
A white cat streaked across Minnie's path as it made its way towards a plain wall and disappeared into it.
"Did you see that cat?" She asked with a frown.
"If you're asking that you have gone crazy? No. I saw it too. Where do you think it went? It like, vanished into the wall." Her friend stood there panting for a while to catch her breath. Minnie had really bad asthma and her parents didn't believe  in medicine. So they didn't give her anything to help it.
"Was thinking the same thing! Huh." They then continued walking down the street towards her house in the hot heat of the day. It was short quick walk since she lived so close to the school they went to.
"So the weather, its nice today. Unlike yesterday..." Minnie and Flix were friends and all but the real person in the trio that bound them together was Lily. They usually made small talk when she wasn't around and it became awkward really fast.
"Yeah way better then yesterday..."
"So...do you know where Lily is?"
"Nah, said she was going on an adventure last week for the first part of summer. But you know her,  she probably went on vacation." She shrugged at the thought of the disappearance of her friend. It was natural for her to tell them that she was going on an adventure when really it wasn't.
Flix ran up her three apartment steps unlocking the door when she got up on the the deck of her dark green house. Inside there were shoutings from the kitchen followed by a slam of the door that lead to it.
"Oh, your home already. And your friend too, well you two can grab a snack from the cabinet. But be careful your moms in a bad mood!" Her dad warned and went up stairs to his and her moms room. She nodded as she passed the entry way while kicking off her sneakers.
"Hello darling, Oh and you too Minnie. Would you like a smoothie I just mad some for me, Flix, and her Dad but since he's being such a pain you can have his." Her mother offered with a warm smile to her and poured to pinkish looking drinks. "Oh and it has no lemons so your safe." she added as she set the tall glass cup down on the smooth white counter in their kitchen.
"So how has you first few minutes of freedom doing? Got any plans?"
Minnie thought for a second before replying, "Well we usually don't do anything without Lily but since she will be gone for the first few weeks I guess we can plan something."
"Was thinking the same, maybe have a sleepover, we haven't decided yet." Flix added before taking a long drink from her smoothie. Its tangy taste filled her mouth along with clumps of strawberry and pineapple that tickled the roof of it. Carefully setting the drink down she opened up her bag to take out a binder full of messy, loose papers. She laid it down on the counter top and opened it up to the last page she had written in. Taking out a pencil she scribbled something down and closed it back up.
