"Have you seen Damon or Elina? because I haven't noticed them for so long" I asked Molly, Diana, Hannah and Helen, "You haven't heard ?" Helen asked, "Heard what?" I raised an eyebrow, "The moved to another house in Chicago" Hannah said, "Oh, really ? So you all heard but I didn't ? Why didn't Elina even tell me anything ? I've lived with them for months ? How could they ? Even Mrs.Carter haven't spoken to me since I left the house. Great !" I said in anger.

"Time to go" Simon whispered from the table behind me and I nodded and left my plate, "I have to go, I got something important to do ", "No, I need to talk to you" The principal said, I swallowed, "I'm kind of busy, I'll come to your office tomorrow, sir" I packed my bag, "Just two minutes, follow me" He pulled my by my backpack. "You didn't go to the Karate rehearsals and we got a match to play tomorrow" I totally forgot about the Karate team, "Don't worry sir, I'll do it and we'll reach the finals, just trust me. Now, I have to go I have an important appointment" Then I left
.....
Me and Simon walked into the church, all eyes were on us but there weren't many, we headed to the priest and told him the whole story, "May God protect both of you, in case you need any help, here's my number and I'll make sure to let everyone know this " the priest said.
Me and Simon left the church, "What did we gain by telling him?" Simon asked, "Nothing, but it's enough to spread the story and let everybody know, I guess... I don't know what to do anymore" I sighed, "GOT YOU" Someone put a bandage with a liquid in it on my nose and mouth, and another one did the same to Simon, Simon was about to blackout, I used my Karate skills and kicked the man that was holding me and helped Simon, he wasn't 100% conscious, neither was I but we managed to run away.
"I don't know what to do now, I just want to sit in a corner and eat chocolate while watching Captain America" I said as we were hiding behind a car then my phone rang."Hello?" I picked up, "Who is it ?" Simon whispered to me, "I'm the minister's right hand, we read the story you spread and the minister wants to see you tomorrow, if this was a prank or a silly joke, you and the boy with you will get arrested. Arrive to the ministry building tomorrow at 2" The man said then hung up."Who was it?" Simon asked, "The Minister wants to see us tomorrow at 2:00pm. We should go and rest, it's been a long day filled with surprises" We stood up then went to our homes.
.....
"Leena, listen, I've read what you've been posting and sharing and my father has a hand in this. We need to meet and talk, I can't say everything on the phone because he is in the next room"
"Did you tell anybody ? Did you tell Simon?" I asked worriedly.
"NO, I need to see you and let everything out before I expload, I'll come to your house if your uncle is there so we won'r be alone"
"No ! Karam must not know a thing"
The moment I thought I was getting easier ... It got worse.
