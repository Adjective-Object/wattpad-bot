CHAPTER FOUR-ONE: THE DREAM

“Hey Chase, we need to get to the hotel fast. My parents might already be there, waiting for us.” Ice instructed me to move faster.
“Wait, wait. I just need to fix my tie. I don't want them having a bad impression of me!”
“You're gorgeous enough already.” He winked at me. I blushed in response.
“Sorry Ice. I'm just having these jitters. I mean, what if they don't... you know, like me?”
“Aww, you're so cute!” He pinched my right cheek gently. “I told you that they are the best parents in the world. They will like you!”
“Ok. I trust you.” I gave him a wide smile.
“That's more like it! Now, let's get moving.”
The car was nothing extraordinary – it wasn't flashy and was normal at best. I kinda' liked it because it doesn't stand out that much. Ice opened the door to the backseat and motioned me to get inside the car. He followed after me.
“Good evening young masters Ice and Chase!” Mister Chen, the family driver, greeted us as we entered the car. He also offered us something to drink. “Here are sodas you can drink while we're on our way to the hotel.”
“Good evening Chen. When did Ma and Pa arrive? Are we late?”
“Don't worry young master Ice; we're still on-time.”
“Good to know. Thanks for the drinks, by the way.” After talking to Chen, he turned around and faced me. He gave me this excited smile. “You're finally gonna' meet them!”
“Ye-yes.” I gulped. “Yes.”
We were almost thirty-minutes away from the venue when everything went wrong. A van was fast-approaching us and we were caught off-guard. Mister Chen made a sharp right turn and stomped the brake hard. It was futile though, as we still crashed into another car. Ice tried to protect me by hugging me but the impact still separated us. The last thing I knew was that my head hurts, really bad.
“Chase! Chase! Chase! Wake up!”
“Ugh...” I heard Ice's voice calling me. I tried to open my eyes and managed to grab a quick glimpse of him. He looked very worried and exhausted. He has blood running on the side of his face.
“Hey babe, hang on. Can you hear me?”
“Y-y-yes.” Everything went black.
“Ching! Ching! Wake up!”
“Not again Ice... let me sleep. Dammit'!”
“Ice? Oi Ching! I'm serious. You have to wake up or you'll be late for class!”
“Let me freaking sleep! Stop touching my hair Ice! It’s freaking Saturday!”
“Stop talking about your boyfriend. I'm your sister! You wake up now or I'll bring Ice here." The word “boyfriend” caught me by surprise. What? I finally realized it was my sister waking me up. Why is she even talking about …“boyfriends”?
“W-what b-boyfriend?!”
“Gosh you’re so weird. You were talking about Ice while sleeping! Of course I would assume he is your boyfriend.”
“N-no! I-I’m not gay!”
“Heh. If you say so. But you know, I’ll support you no matter what.” She gave me a wink and a foxy grin.
