"Just coffee, please."
The green-eyed barista rose his eyebrows, and glanced at me with a suspicious look.
"Don't you want anything to eat? You look pretty worn out," He said with a chuckle, and started pouring my plain black coffee in a mug.
"No, I'm not a big fan of eating early in the morning, but thank you anyways." I offered him a small smile, before handing him 10 bucks and carefully taking the coffee out of his hands.
"Keep the change," I turned around and walked towards my usual spot in the inner left corner of the coffee-shop and sat down. I placed the steaming hot cup of liquid on the rectangular black table, and pulled out my favorite book from my purse. I took a sip from the warm beverage, and started reading.
The barista boy was working his way around the tables, cleaning them, laying down new table-cloths and lighting new fig scented candles.
The sun was just about to rise, and bring life into the almost empty coffee-shop.Leaves was gliding elegantly trough the late September wind.
"If you don't mind me asking, why on earth are you awake at this hour?" I looked up from the sea of words, to see the barista boy cleaning the table next to me.
"It isn't that unusual, is it? A high-school drop-out, sitting in a small-town coffee-shop, reading a John Green book at 6 am?" I chuckled at him, as he made his way towards my table.
He pulled out a chair and sat on it with his stomach facing the back  of it. " 'Looking for Alaska', huh? That's a depressing one." He said as he intertwined his hands together on the table.
"It's not depressing, it's deep!" I protested with a laugh.
"Nah, It's depressing." He reached out his hand for me to shake, and I gladly shook it.
"My name is Michael, which you probably knew, due to my name-tag," he pointed out.
"I hadn't in fact looked at your name-tag. I'm Lilith." I smiled and he looked surprised.
"Like the demon?" He whispered, making me wide eyed.
"Yes! Christ! No-one, and I mean no-one I have met have known!" I exclaimed.
"I watch Supernatural" He laughed, and started getting up. He held up a finger, as if saying 'I'll be right back'. He grabbed my mug and walked back into the coffee-bar. He came back with a new cup of black coffee and put in down beside me.
"On the house" He said with a wink.
I blushed, and took a sip from the floating gold in my cup. "So... What's an Aussie doing in Louisiana?" I leaned towards Michael with my chin resting in the palm of my hand.
"Change of scenery" he grinned, before quickly replying; "You're not from here either I can hear."
I shook my head, looking down at the now closed novel. "Is it that obvious?"
He nodded, I could hear his smile in his voice, "Take it from someone who knows, faking accents are not easy"
I lifted my head and met his eyes, sighing.
"New York. Moved down here about a month ago" He raised he eyebrows and leaned forwards, encouraging me to keep on going. "Go on," He said, and it was confusing why he even was interested.
"I think that's another story for another time. Here," I pulled out a pen from my purse and took the napkin from under the coffee-cup. I wrote down my number and handed it to him. Before getting up and throwing the purse-strap over my shoulder. "Call me sometime. Or, well, you'll probably see me often if you're the one working the morning-shifts." I smiled before giving him a small wave and exiting the warm coffee-shop and walking out into the cold autumn air.
