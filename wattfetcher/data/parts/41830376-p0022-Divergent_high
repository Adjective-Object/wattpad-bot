Warning: this chapter contains blood, pain, and sadness! Also this chapter will skip from Tris to Tobias and back to Tris! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TrisI know Luke won't be here tonight because every Wednesday he works late. He will be the first to see me, Dead. I need to figure out what to do for my suicide. I can't use a gun cause surprising he doesn't believe in guns. I think about so many things but then one comes to mind. Luke's switch blade. I run into his room, which i may add is a mess. I need to find the blade if i want to go through with this! I go look at his book shelf. I rip out the books until i see a little silver sparkle. I go to grab it and i pull it out, the blade. I run back to my room, i don't want to cut myself until later. I put the blade on the counter and just stare at it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TobiasWhat the hell did Tris mean by 'She doesn't know?' If she is leaving then she should know where she is going. Is she leaving Luke? Moving? Where is she going? My mind is wrapped around where she is going. I need to know where she is going, i want her to be safe. I still Love her, I haven't stopped! I believe the story she said about Peter pulling her into the closet and kissing her but I'm still upset. She thinks that i hate her or something but i don't. She probably hates me for the stunt Sheridan pulled yesterday but the truth is, i had nothing to do with it. I don't know how she found out but i swear to god i will get her back. I pull into the driveway of my house. I get out of the car and walk inside. My mind somehow finds its way back to Tris. Does she actually don't know where she is going or is she lying. I can't get my mind off of her. God her, she cut her hair and it looks great! Her hair is now a blonde pixie cut, it makes her look older. "Hey honey how was school?" My mom asks, while i was thinking I didn't realize i made my way to the kitchen. "Umm... Yeah... Good." I mumble."Okay?" She says while going back to cutting something, i don't anymore attention to her. I need to see her, or at least hear her voice. "See you later!" I yell as i walk out the door."But you just-" my mom says but i close the door before she can finish. I get i. My car and drive. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tris I'm the reason for all my problems! I make everyones day terrible and everyone hates me. After i'm dead people would probably throw a party. I can't handle it anymore. I grab the knife off the table. I need to do it before i rip myself apart. I run the cold steel over my finger tips. I need to do this for me and everyone else. I position the knife over my wrist, i need to do this. I make a few cuts on both wrists. The pain is excruciating painful but i keep going. I start to see little black dotes. It's working. A few more cuts and then it is over. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TobiasI put the car in park and get out. Tris's house is absolutely huge, it is because she is pretty rich. Luke, or as i call the Devil on Earth, works for the government. I remember once how she told me he always works late on Wednesday's so I'm good to go. I walk up to the door, as i get ready to knock it slowly opens. She must've forgot to open the door. I walk in and look around, she isn't down here."Tris?" I yell. No answer. I slowly walk upstairs to see if she is up there. She is most likely in her room. I go to her door and open it to find the worst thing in the world. Blood drips from her wrists and hits the wood floor. Her hand holds a knife with blood all over it. "Tris?"! I whisper. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tris. I swore i hear someone call my name but i need to not think about it. I take another quick swipe before something happens. My door opens and someone walks in, Tobias. My hands tremble at the sight of him. What is going through his mind right now? "Tris?" He whispers load enough so i can hear. Why is he here? Why did he show up? Black dotes start to cloud my eyes again, it is almost over. I need to say something. They would be my last words. My last words need to be truthful."I. Love. You. Tobias." I say. I look down at my wrists and make one more swipe against a major part of my wrist. The spots start to spread across my eyes, and my body becomes heavy. i fall backwards and hit the hard floor. This is death, the feeling of everything drifting away from you. Feeling that the hard things are gone and now all is new. I'm leaving everything behind all the crap. I feel my body slip into the ground as everything goes black. I finally get to be free from all the shit that i've lived with. I'm free. I feel two string arms wrap around me and i know they are Tobias's. I still don't know why Tobias showed up for me, but what i do know is... I still love and will miss Tobias.
