Ashley always thtoght that because of her size she would never meet a man or have kids ,Ashley has only been with 2 men for for whole 23 years .After the last guy she swear off men that is until today
Ashley woke up at 6 in the morning and did her morning routine and was out the door earlier than usual .Ashley works with her Grandmother at her bakery . Ashley's Grandmother became her only family member that Ashley still like to speak with since her mother gave her away at birth and pretends not to  be her mother at family gatherings . She also has two older brothers but their in the marines.
Ashely made her way into the bakery to be greeted by the sweet aroma of sweet sugar cakes and lollipops ,then her grandma walked in not that she wasn't happy to see her but she didn't feel like being bothered " morning baby how are you""I'm good how are you" she said a little bit annoyed "Mhm we are going to need to redo this because you forgot the nice part of a morning greeting" I didn't intend for it to come out as rude as it did ,and I certainly did not intend to get attitude for my grandma but she not having it today "Sorry I'm just under the weather and still a little tired I got up a whole hour earlier than usual ""Oh well that's not really an excuse ,but let's move on I put the ovens on already I need you to get to work on the batter and later were getting a delivery I need you to move it if you need any help I always here okay now get to work baby""Okay" I walked away and my grandma slapped me on my behind "What was that for""Your attitude now get cracking hon"I'm about  and hour into work and our fist customer if the day came in I didn't bother  looking back because I know that they wouldn't want to start their morning off looking at me.I hear Anna ( employee) giggling that means that there's a cute guy out there that she's wooing then grandma comes in."Sweety can you go out there and takes some orders along side Anna to take the mans order please he's been her at least 10 minutes and the line is growing "As much as I don't want to go it would make my grandmother happy so I'm only doing this for her."Okay""Awe thank you so much"nodding my head I make it to the front "LINE TWO IS OPEN" I shout getting the  peoples attention Anna's while line moves to me accept for the man whose she was talking to I can still hear their conversation something about his eyes I finish up my line still not bothering ITo look at Anna who so happeneds to be still talking to the man but I haven't heard him utter a word except for a few mhm's here and there with my last customer finished up I turn to Anna to ask her to move out the way so I can grab the woman's order that is under the counter But what I see stops me he is the most gorgeous thing I've seen in a long time that is in real life and not on a TV screen.  I see that he happens to be looking at me probably disgusted with me so I Turn to Anna "Excuse me I need to get a cake out "She looks at me and moves slowly out of the way and sent me a glare that's looks like she's a little bit annoyed I rush past her and grab the cake and go "What's your name" I hear "I told you my name already" Anna said"I wasn't talking to you I'm talking to her "I finally turn around at that to see him pointing at me "Oh don't worry about her she isn't important" Anna said I turn to look at her "Excuse you she can speak for herself I'm Ashley " I say "Mmm what a beautiful name for someone so beautiful as you" wait what did he just say did I just hear him correctly"What about my name anna ""Yeah your names OK " I couldn't help the smile that tugged on my lips but I had to get back to workI sneak away a d hand the woman her order and off to the back with Anna hot on my tail"Have you lost your mind"who she talking to honey I'm not he one"Who are you talking to""You your the only one in the room ""What do you want""I want you to leave him alone" who is he"Leave who alone""Don't play dumb" "Trust me I'm not playing who are you talking about ""The man at the front who was flirting with me duhh" I couldn't help but laugh "What's funny""Y...you said that sentence so wrong that it aint right you were flirting wi..with him he barely said anything" she stormed out of the room and to the front where that guy just so happened to be staring at me again. Its not possible that he is attracted to me let's get that out of my head now ~hours laterMe and grandma close up for the day and we make out to the front where I still see that man sitting at a table "Umm were closing you have to leave""Okay I'll leave if you promise to go out on a date with me""No" I said confidently "Please I'll make it the best moments of your life ""Sorry no " I made my way to the door and started to push when a heavy hand closed it back "Can I at least walk you to your car "I just nodding ready to get this over with this "This is me goodnight"Goodnight beautiful I'll see you around" he said with a smirk like he new something I didn't .I made it home just in time to see My favorite show The foster and feel asleep watching the show
