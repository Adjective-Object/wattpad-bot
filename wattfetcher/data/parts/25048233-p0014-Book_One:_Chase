“What the fuck are you talking about, Mel?” Her full name is Mellorie. It sucks - I know.
“You’re so cute when you’re blushing. Anyway, I’m heading down first. Go wash yourself if you want but I dare you not fall asleep again or you’ll surely learn your lesson.”
“…” I wasn’t able to reply anything back to her. She was bluffing anyways. Now, back to sleep.
I surrendered to the heaviness of my eyelids. Darkness covered everything all over again. I’m so tired. I need more sleep. Besides, it’s Saturday. I don’t have any classes today. I don’t have anything scheduled either. Speaking of schedules, I think I might’ve forgotten something. I just can’t remember what that is. Nevermind.
Suddenly, my body felt heavier. It’s as if I was being pulled by a blackhole. I can’t move. Am I dreaming? Is this what you call, Sleep Paralysis? So damn heavy!
“Wake up now, you sleepyhead.”
I opened my eyes and was surprised on the person I saw. Ice was on top of me, grinning ever so widely! What the fuck? “I-Ice?! What are you doing here?!” I quickly pushed him away from me. What the fuck?
“Chase… I mean, Ching…” Oh god, he now knows my lame nickname.
“W-what?! Don’t call me Ching! Call me Chase. Dammit!” I blushed.
“Eh. Ching is a lot cuter! It suits you perfectly. I like it.” He smiled again. “Ching, have you forgotten about something?”
“…” I tried to remember everything that has happened within the past few days. I remember Art showing me a picture of me and Ice almost kissing. I also remember how he told me it was our secret. Hmm.

<Yesterday (Friday)>
“Chase! Wait up!”
Ice came running to me. I turned around to see him catching his breath. He just recently finished his meeting with the Newspaper Club about their printing budget. What does he need me for?
“What do you want?” I waited for him to finally relax.
“Well, we’re having this party later. And…”
“And… I won’t go if that’s where you’re heading. Sorry.” I continued walking.
“Well, you’re required.”
“…” I stopped. What the fuck?
“Yeah, that’s right. It’s a party for all the Class Presidents. Don’t you remember that it’s school tradition? A week before the club activities start, the Student Council organizes a party.”
“I’m quite sure that it was meant only for the Club Presidents, not Class Presidents. Sorry, I can’t go.” I continued walking again.
“W-we changed the rules just now!”
“I’m pretty sure that’s a lame excuse. Besides, why wasn’t I informed ahead of time? Why now?”
“I already called your parents and they agreed. So yeah, see you later.” He ran as fast as he could away from me.
“What the fuck, Ice?!”
I’m seriously amazed at how Ice planned everything. I mean, how he got my parents’ numbers was quite surprising. Oh, he’s the Student Council President… Dammit!
