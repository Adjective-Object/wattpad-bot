I: what's wrong?
A: i was just going to talk to Eevee about school and.....
I: oh my god what happened?
A: she um...... she was busy....
I: was she...?
A: yeah...........
I: eww and good for her!
A: i am scarred for life.
I: what about when you walked in on Dan and Phil practicing BDSM?
A: that was not as weird to me
I: is it because we are gay that we think that her masterbating is gross?
A: most of the male society thinks that is gross.
I: true..............
A: she didn't even notice i walked in either...
I: how?
A: she had headphones on
I: yeah makes sense...
A: i just awkwardly walked out and now i'm here.
I: ok well i guess we need to have 'the talk' with her then?
A: but she's only 10, Ian.
I: she's masterbating. she needs the talk.
A: fine. but you're doing it this time.
I: fine.
