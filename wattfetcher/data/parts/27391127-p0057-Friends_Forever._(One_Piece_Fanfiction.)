"I'm sorry sir, it will not happen again." Haruka apologized.
"Why did you go on the job?" White beard asked firmly. There was silence.

"I said- WHY DID YOU GO ON THE JOB!" Whitebeard shouted slamming his bisento (tall spear-like weapon)  into the floor. The subsequent effect was an immediate earthquake in the room and a tremor to be felt outside the office.
Aya and Haruka were barely able to guard against it.


Sakura: Caelum mandatum: Tranquilla.

With that, the air instantly became calm. To the shock of most people, this one actually had guts to stand up to Whitebeard.

"Quit that!"Sakura shouted.  This caught the attention of both Whitebeard and Marco.

"It's not our fault, we went on that job. It was Ace's fault!" Sakura answered boldly, despite that one minute ago, she was susceptible to the man's haki.

Whitebeard narrowed his eyes on her before ordering Marco to bring Ace in. After he left, Whitebeard broke out laughing. In the midst, of his laughter, Haruka wondered whether the old man was on crack.

"You got some remarkable courage there."
"Thank you, although it was nothing."
"Sakura, did you just make Whitebeard laugh?" Haruka asked.
"Yeah, I think I did." Sakura answered, scratching her head.

As soon as Ace step foot inside of the room....

"You bastard!" Both Aya and Sakura yelled and in record time, they beat Ace to a purple pulp.
"You, imbeciles. How doare you treat Ace-sama that way!" Haruka exclaimed. The girls turned around slowly and gave Haruka glares that would send him straight to hell.

"Ace is it true that you sent these young'uns on job without a senior student?"
"Yeah Oyaji. It was quite an easy job and I needed to get it off my hands."
"So basically we got in trouble because you were too damn lazy to do your job properly."
"Yep." Ace answered with a small laugh. It can be correctly said that new forms of facepalm were invented that day.

Whitebeard: Face desk.
Marco: Face wall
Sakura: Face floor
Haruka: Face door
Aya: Face shoulder.

"Even though you three are innocent, we need the stdents to understand that they can't do whatever they want so you will be placed in dentention however, it won't go on you files."

"Thank you, Marco!" Aya exclaimed hugging the blonde's head in her chest and jumping up and down.
