And then, the snowball.
Dean noticed that Cas wasn't throwing as many snowballs as he was.
"Giving up?" he called.
Cas popped up out of absolutely nowhere with the most ginormous, big-ass snowball Dean had ever seen.
"Not exactly."
Dean saw where Cas was aiming. His face.
"Cas, don't you fucking dare throw that snowba--!" He was cut off when previously mentioned big-ass snowball connected with his face. "GODDAMMIT!" he yelled.
Cas laughed so hard he fell down into the snow.
"Yeah, you laugh your perky little ass off now, just wait. I'll get you one of these days."
"Oh, so," Castiel began, trying to calm down after this fit of laughter. "My ass is perky now?"
Dean froze.
He couldn't blame that one on the cold.
"I, um, I-you-we, uh..." Thankfully, this stuttering ended when Cas pulled Dean down into the snow with him. All this somehow ends with Cas straddling Dean.
Dean pulled his angel down to him by his shirt collar and kissed him for the first time.
It was soft at first, and Dean noted that Cas tasted like honey.
Then years of ignoring what was there, years of "the one in the dirty trench coat who's in love you," years of "he was your boyfriend first," years of "I need you," it all comes spilling into their memories. They're hungry. For each other.
Then, a moose.
"AhahahhaHAHAHAHAHAH! I KNEW IT! DEASTIEL. I'm telling the message boards that Dean is a bottom!"
And just like that, he's gone.
Dean shrugged and continued making out with his angel.
It's both of their favorite snowfalls, by far.
