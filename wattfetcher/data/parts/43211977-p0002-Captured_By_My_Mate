I sat at the table uncomfortable because of everyone staring at me. To break the silence this muscular man asks me "So you must like Ethan huh?" I reply making eye contact to a smirking Ethan" I don't knee after I was abducted and forced into coming here I only know that I like his personality." Ethan asked "So your human Emily?" It sounds so good when he says my name and I reply "yes are you not?" He replies "no I have to show you something." He willingly took me to the backyard and then he turned into a dog "werewolf!" I scream as I run away. He pounces on me as I scream and we roll he said "sh! We are mates that is how I can always find you and that is why you might feel tingles when we kiss. Do you?" I reply "no I don't... I really don't... I don't know" he then shifted as he kissed me and we rolled around in the grass for a bit till I felt the tingles and then,I realised I was making out with a naked Ethan.
SORRY FOR THE SHORT CHAPTER!!!
