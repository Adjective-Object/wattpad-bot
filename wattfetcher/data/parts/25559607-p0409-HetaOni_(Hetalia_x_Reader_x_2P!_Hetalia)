"Take my hand. We're going through this together." he told me.
Nodding, I slowly took his hand in mine. He was wearing gloves, but I can really feel the warmth. "Alright."
With his right hand, he forcefully drove his knives down at the clock and broke it.
And in a blink of an eye, everything around me changed.

"....Huh? We're..." (Name) whispered, looking around. "....wait, we're still on the same floor. Is this really the past?"
The magenta-eyed Italian beside her listened intently. "....Yes. I can...hear them from over there." he pointed at the room that was supposedly their meeting room.
"Alright...we can move, right?" she asked, lightly taking a step forward.
Nodding, Luciano led her towards the door. "We can move, but we aren't able to touch anything from this time...so...no matter how much we'd want to do something...we can't."
The two passed through the door and entered the meeting room. There, they saw all too familiar faces.

"Well, that may be so... I-I just thought, well, if fans are able to like both the 1Ps and the 2Ps...people could might as well do that here, too. I mean, it was uncalled for the 1Ps to banish you all...but isn't it the same to do it in their case? Can't this be worked out in some other way?" a (h/c) haired girl asked. It was Past (Name).
Past Luciano gave a sarcastic laugh. "Ragazza, you know very well that it's not that easy. Maybe you're forgetting that...", he suddenly threw a knive that flew past the girl and hit the wall behind her, "...that we are dangerous people. Those bastards won't allow us to do anything."
The girl gave a heavy sigh, and spoke softly, "...But it doesn't mean that you guys couldn't live like normal people, without feeling deprived of anything."
"Live normally? Hah. Those 'First Players' treat us like trash. They think of us as lower life forms. Who would let us live normally? Who would even accept us???" Past Luciano asked, starting to sound frustrated by their discussion.
"Given the circumstances that you wouldn't kill me, I would. I would accept you guys." Past (Name) told them. "You guys exist. The mere fact that you guys still do is because you guys still have a purpose in this world. Sure, I know you guys are capable of murdering people...but if you guys learn to control that, you guys could still, well, live 'normally'. Even not as 'normal' as others, but at least being yourselves'..."
Furrowing her brows, (Name) turned to the Italian beside her. "Wait...haven't I said this to you guys back in the current time loop?" she asked.
"Yeah. It was the same thing you said here, so my answer was the same, as well." Luciano replied. "The difference here, though...is that you were brought here inside the mansion by us, you met us Second Players first, and.... you were actually able to convince us to trust you earlier. Your words were too geniune not to believe in."
"R-Really? But then...why...?" she trailed, looking at the scene in front of them change.
Luciano shook his head. "But, of course, though you mattered to us...we believed we had our own agenda to push through at all costs."
