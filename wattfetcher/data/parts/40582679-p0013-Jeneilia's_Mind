Hello to whoever read this! So today im gonna talk about this girl band call little mix.
So like most Directioners we found out about little mix when Zayn started dating Perrie. I'm really happy I found out about the band because there really amazing and super talented!!!!!. Little mix is often compared with Fifth harmony although fifth harmony are more famous than little mix which is stupid to me I mean don't get me wrong fifth harmony is good and I like them ( Miss moving on is amazing!) but Little mix have inspirational songs and not songs about guys money etc Little mix do sing about it but not to the extent than Fifth harmony go . Little mix is just really a lot better to me but if fifth harmony is better to you then cool life's about the polarities. My favorite song for little mix right now is Black magic its such a good song and the video is amazing . I love all the girls there so beautiful and talented I think Perries cute and funny I think Jades adorable and adorable!!! I think Leigh is really pretty and I love her accent I think Jesy is a big beautiful barbie!!!!!!!!. I so greatly admire and love this band so much! There just a bunch of cuties!!!!!! . ~Jeneilia Xxx
