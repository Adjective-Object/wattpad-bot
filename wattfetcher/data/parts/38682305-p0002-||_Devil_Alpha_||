He steps closer to me and my heart speeds up. Anger was clear in his eyes, I couldn't help but smirk at the sight. He just wants me to become a Luna?!? A toy?!? He picks me up and puts me on the table but I stay silent.. "You're lucky you're my mate. I would have slit your throat by now."•••Please she can't just give me up like this! What is she doing?? I looked back at Luke who was asking my mom if he could take me to his pack!! He smiles at my mom and starts walking towards me, taking my arm in his he yanks me to his car...
"You're mine now." •••  Looking at the house in front of us my jaw drops. He smirks and takes me inside. Every time he tried to touch me I'd flinch. I walk next to Luke ignoring the glares I got from people as we walked to his room.Once we finally reached the room he pulled my body towards the door. I flinch at the pain in my head.       "Now I can mark you!"
