"Of course." The elf smiled.
Thorin took the necklace then put it on for me. I wobbled over to Gandalf. Pain shot through me. I fell to the ground and screamed in agony. Thorin came to my side. I felt where my helicopter wound. It was reopened. "Urug-i√¢r (orc-blood)!" I cursed. I noticed the elf who returned my necklace look at me. Thorin brushed some of my hair behind my half pointed ears. Everyone gasped. My surroundings went black.
Blake's POV....
Michelle fainted at the loss of blood. Thorin backed away from her. He finally noticed that my ears were the same as Michelle's. The leader of the elves here ran up to Michelle. He lifted her up and offered us food. He then carried Michelle away. I wanted to go too but Gandalf stopped me. Fili took Michelle's weapons with us.
"Lord Elrond will heal Michelle. She will be alright." Gandalf assured me.
A glowing white light appeared around me. My blonde hair grew longer. My ears were fully pointed. I became taller and slightly muscular. The white light disappeared. Elrond came back.
"You finally went through the change. Your friend will awaken soon." Elrond told us.
Michelle's POV....
I woke up in a strange room. I heard footsteps coming toward the room. I leaned forward. The door opened. Thorin camp in. I stood up. I was taller than him. I smiled. "Are you alright?" I asked. I put my hand on his cheek. He pushed it away.
"I don't need your comfort elf nor your love!" Thorin spat.
"I am still me." I stated.
"No. You're one of them. I don't want you to be a part of this company. I don't want to see you near me again or I will kill you with my bare hands. You disgust me."
My heart ached badly. I ran out of the room with tears streaming down my face. I saw Fili. He had concern written on his face. I fell to my knees. Fili came over to me. He wiped my tears away. "What happened? Why are you crying?" Fili asked.
"Thorin hates me for being an elf. Please don't hate me. My heart aches as it is." I cried.
"I could never hate you. You are still the woman I fell in love with. Ignore what uncle said." Fili said.
"This is like a dream I had. When we can here, it was like another dream. Gandalf told me that they were visions. I believe that they were connected as one vision to let me know that I would be with you."
"I'm glad."
Fili held me close to him. I continued to cry in his arms. Fili wiped my tears away again. He lifted my chin up a little then kissed me like in my dream. I pulled away to look at him. "I love you too, Fili." I smiled.
