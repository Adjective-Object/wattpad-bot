Leilani laughed at her best friend, Amare. He was currently explaining why he would never have a one night stand again.
"Yo I'm telling you this bitch was crazy, came over to my house the next night talking about let me get that dick again. I was like hell naw bitch, yo pussy wasn't even that good, and she need to douche the next time, she ought to be ashamed of herself."
Leilani rolled over on the couch in tears.
"But you still slept with her," his twin brother Adrienne said.
Amare shot Adrienne a look.
"That's not the point, my dick was hard as a rock."
"I'm so done with you," Leilani said getting up from her couch.
"So are we going out or what?"
"Sure, let's do it," she said looking at her best friends.
Amare, Adrienne, and Leilani had been friends since they were in diapers. Their fathers had been teammates and as the years went on they grew closer.
"Well hurry that fat ass up," Adrienne said smacking her ass.

When Colin walked into the club, he got the reaction he thought he would and he smirked.
"Kap daddy let me put this pussy on you."
He shook his head and walked farther into the club and brought himself a drink, when he saw a female that nearly took his breath away. Making his way over to her, he smiled as she turned around.
"Hi I'm Colin Kae-"
"Yea I know who you are and no I'm not fucking you, nor do I find you impressive. So keep walking."
No woman had ever talked to him that way and he found himself being turned on. He opened his mouth to say something else, when she cut him off.
"And yet you're still standing here."
He smirked and walked off. When he heard his phone ring. stepping into a corner, he answered the phone.
"Hello."
"Yes is this Colin Kaepernick?"
"It is."
"Great this is Bradley Vaughn how are you?"
"I'm good."
"That's great I need your hotel information, I have a place set up for you to stay for your time here."
"Ok, I'll text it to you."
"That'll be great."
"Who will I be staying with?"
"My daughter," Bradley said as he hung up the phone.
Colin hoped that this daughter was cute and single. Little did he know that he had just met his roommate for the next seven months.
