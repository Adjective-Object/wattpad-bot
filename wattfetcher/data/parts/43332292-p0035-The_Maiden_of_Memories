Lethe stood up shakily, with him steadying her. It felt like she was learning to walk all over again. "Alright, but first we need to go back to the banquet hall. I have some other people who are travelling with me, and I don't think they'd like it if I just left them there hanging. We're bringing them along for the ride if this is serious."
"This is definitely serious, and I'm fine with that, as long as they can be sneaky enough."
"The first one, I'm sure he can do it. The other... we may have a bit of a problem with that."
He laughed. Then he swung her over his back, wrapping her arms around his neck. "Just stay still, okay? I'm going to have a bit of a problem carrying you down, so it'll be a load easier if you don't make any trouble for me."
"Alright," she replied, and he started moving to the edge of the roof. Then she realized something that she had forgotten to do earlier. "Hey, can I ask you one more question?"
"Yeah. What's the question?"
"What's your name?"
Lethe could've sworn she saw him smile. "Hyas. And you are?"
"Lethe. My name's Lethe."
Hyas seemed to smile even wider. "That's a pretty name, Lethe. Pretty name for a pretty 'maid, I'd say."
