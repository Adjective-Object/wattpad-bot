"Did you take your pills today?" Sara asked me as I walk into the house.
"Yes I did." I replied as I escaped up to my room.
"WAIT, ROBIN!" She yells from downstairs. I was hoping she forgot about Thomas in my room this morning. I thought as she walked into my room.
"You are GROUNDED for having that boyfriend of yours in your room and we didn't even know about him! Why didn't you tell us about him???" She exclaimed as she grabbed my phone off the bed.
"I need th-"
"And this is mine as well. I can't trust you, you can get it back when you show me that I can trust you." She said before walking out of the room. I sit on my bed for an hour looking at the ceiling. I get grounded...... just my luck.
(A few hours later)
The feeling to cut is stronger than ever, I glance over at the desk drawer where the blade is laying. Sara got this other type of medicine that I should take if I ever feel Like cutting again, but the need to cut is stronger than the choice to get medicine.
Walking over to the desk I get out the bloody blade. Holding it to my wrist I cut a line over and over. Blood covers my arm as a giggle escapes my open mouth. With wide eyes I look down at what I did, my arm covered in cuts.
Hurrying I put the blade away, next I grab a roll of toilet paper and press it against my arm. After the bleeding stops I flush the toilet paper down toilet, then I pull on one of my jackets.
"Robin, there's a letter for you!" Sara yells from downstairs. Walking through the open door and down the stairs I see Hunter, holding a letter in his hands.
"Here." He handed me the letter and waved goodbye as he walked out the door. After giving Sara a smile I run up to my room. Once the door is shut, I open the letter.
Robin,I haven't seen you in a while. I'm glad I got to see you again even if it was a short amount of time. I've been worried about you.... Stay strong. ~Black_Raven192
Is he Hunter? I question as I put the letter with others...
