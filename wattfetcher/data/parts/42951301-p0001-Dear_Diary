Dear diary, I don't know why I'm interested in him all of a sudden. It's sad to think that he was almost gone. Malachi had overdosed on pills. He's been out of school for a week and just came back today.
He's saying that he had a headache and I guess he thought the fastest way for it to go away was to take a bunch of pain killers and where did it get him? In the hospital and sent to the crazy house for a week.
He literally joked about the experience as if it wasn't serious! He could've died! I'm just happy he didn't. It didn't feel right without him at school. Something felt as if it was missing.
We were sitting at a table prepping for finals when he comes out of nowhere and tells me that he just asked my best friend out. All o could say was "oh" and "great" buy inside I just felt something different. These feelings had come from no where. Well not no where but I don't know why they'd come so suddenly. That's when I realized I liked him. That I always have.
