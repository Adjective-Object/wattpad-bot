Y'know. I couldn't transition alone. Even if I got top surgery I couldn't get home. I couldn't shower alone. I couldn't get things down from high places alone. I couldn't drive alone. I couldn't adjust my fluid bags alone. I couldn't change my bandaging alone. I couldn't do anything.
But it would just be me. If I got top surgery it would only be me. I'd be standing alone looking in that mirror y'know. Just me. I'm sure it'd play out like usual in my dreams. At first I'd be happy but then as I began to realize there was no one there my smile would drop. I would just be standing there with a nurse I barely knew. Just me. Just. Alone. I wouldn't be able to handle that by myself. I wouldn't want to bother people either. It seems plausible that it would play out like my dreams. Then I would slowly just break. Alone in the bathroom. This time in the dream there's no one to knock on the door and ask me to come out. I'll just be in there. Hitting the mirror. Crying like an idiot. Just. I'm sure I couldn't do that. I'd rather be stuck than like that. I really would. Because I know I couldn't handle myself. I'm better off staying like I am. That's how it'll be for now. Just. The wrong body.
But hey. That's me. Just. Me.
I'm not even sure it makes me sad anymore. I'm just accepting how it's going to go. Because I'm stuck. And I don't see it changing much anytime soon. But oh well.
