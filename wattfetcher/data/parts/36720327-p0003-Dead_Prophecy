"What would you like to know?" He asked me easily ready to give me information.
"Was it murder or a freak accident?" I blurted not knowing how to dance around the subject.
He laughed humorlessly. "Freak accident, I think. Why?" He gave me a curious look like he wasn't sure what to make of my question.
God, I probably sounded like a freak. "I just wanted to know. I was told he drowned, but that doesn't seem right unless you guys found him in the bath. . ."
He shook his head. "He fell into the king's moat in front of the castle."
I frowned. "That can't be right he has no business there. He made barrels for a living."
Okay, so that could appear really disrespectful but it's true. He never goes near the castle as far as I know. He tells me everything that isn't too personal. So what was he doing there?
The sheriff shook is head looking rather weary. "I'm sorry miss, but I wouldn't have a clue why Mr. Saint-Valeri was there yesterday, but I guess if you really think there could be foul play involved I can interview people and check the body again," He answered referring to my father with his last name instead of his first.
"Thank you," I said before giving him my biggest smile that I could manage and exiting the sheriff building.
There was nothing left for me to do but wait, and possibly grieve some more, but mostly wait. It was aggravating not knowing. I guess I could go to my father's home to see if he left anything behind claiming what he was doing there at the king's moat. He always did like writing his plans down.
That's what I'll do I decided finally, a smile pulling at the corners of my lips, surprisingly. Quickly though, I contained it, it would seem rather odd that I am smiling just hours after finding out about my own father's death someone I was close to, and almost everyone knew it.
