i glared at my dog as i passed alex
,"Teddy i will drop kick you to the moon"i was not in the mood to deal with him barking.i went over to the taco shells and started nibbling on it while i got a soda for me and alex.
i rolled my eyes when i saw bryan come down and he WOULDNT STOP STOMPING.
,"oh.my.god.why is he STOMPING?!"bry came down stares and said
,"kill yourself kris."i rolled my eyes and lost my appitite.,"did he just say what i thought he just said?"alex asked in disbelief.
,"go kill yourself kris.."she glared,"unbelievable.."she shook her head and continued to work on her drawing stitting down at the kitchen table.
i frowned and shrugged.going upstairs we listened to a few songs before she decided she wanted to ask akhira if she were strait or not.once that little situation was over with she wanted to take a walk.
i groaned inwardly.i was too lazy to walk at all.. ill go and get it over with anyways..i could youse it to burn off some of this disgusting fat.i need to loose some wieght its pathetic,and gross.
