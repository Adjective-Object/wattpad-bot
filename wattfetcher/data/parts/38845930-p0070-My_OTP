Erin's POV
"You can't leave me!" I screamed after Jordan told me he was going to.
"I can't be with you anymore, your life is too screwed up for me to be in it."
"Jordan!" I screamed as he walked away.
"I don't love you." He said.
"Jordan!"
"Why did I ever think I loved you?" He asked.
"No! Jordan, no! Don't leave me! No."
~~~Flash out of Erin's dream~~~
"No." I woke up saying. "No!" I screamed. "Oh, Jordan." I said grabbing and squeezing his limp sleeping body. "I still love you." I said waking him up.
"Hmm?" He asked.
"I really do still love you, I really really do." I said.
"Okay, I love you too." He said
"I love you." I said again.
"Okay, Erin? Are you okay?" He asked.
"I love you." I said again and again.
"Erin, it's okay. Why are you crying?" He asked.
"I'm sorry." I said.
"Erin, shut up. What's wrong?" He asked trying to pry me from him so he could see my face.
"I'm sorry." I cried.
"Why? Baby, stop crying." He said. I cuddled in closer and wouldn't let go. "Erin? Why are you crying?" He asked again.
"I'm sor -- sorry!" I screamed.
"Please, no... no crying. I do not allow. Come on, please dont cry." He said.
"I love you! I love you, way too much." I said.
"Okay, baby, I love you too, why are you crying?" He asked.
"You can't leave me, I'm sorry." I said.
"I'm not leaving you. Why are you crying, because you didn't call? A bad dream? What?" He asked.
"You can't leave, I love you." I said.
"Come on, baby. I'm not leaving you... ever, I know I almost did... once, but it won't happen again." He said running his finger through my hair.
"You said you didn't love me." I cried.
"I love you, I really love you. Did I say that in your dream or something?" He asked.
"Yes! But it felt too real." I said.
"I love you, I won't ever stop loving you." He said kissing me head.
"Okay, I love you. I love you, Jordan. I love you, I'm sorry. I love you." I kept saying over and over as he looked in my watery eyes. "I know you love me, I know it... I'm sorry." I cried and sniffled.
"I love you." He said.
As we lied there holding each other, I cried and said "I'm sorry". Jordan stuck his face in my neck and kissed me, I laughed at his weird face that he was cheering me up with, held his hand and kissed him. "I'm sorry I -- " I said.
"Shut up." He growled, he kissed my cheek and snuggled up against me putting a smile on my face.
"Thank you." I said. I sat up and my stomach growled, I didn't realize I was that hungry.
"I heard that, you must be hungry." He said.
