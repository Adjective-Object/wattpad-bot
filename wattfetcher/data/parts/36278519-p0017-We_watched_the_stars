Signing, I closed the fridge door and take out my phone, dialing Cheri's number. When it didn't pick up I cursed, putting the phone back in my pocket. I propped my elbows up on a counter, closing my eyes and trying to think of where she would be. When I couldn't figure anything out I opened my eyes and only then did I notice there was a night yellow sticky note in front of me. Curiously I picked it up. It read in capital letters CHERI'S HOSTEL then below had an address.
I felt a chill go up my spine. This wasn't Cheri's hand writing...and why would she give me the address.
Instantly I grabbed the keys to my car and sprinted out the door. I had to get there. Jumping into my car, I looked back down at the address.

When I got to the hostel I asked about Cheri and described her. They told me which room she was staying in and I hurriedly walked to it. When I opened the door, nothing was there. But on the bed was...Cheri's phone? This time over slowly and stood over the bed. The phone was shut off and had a sticky note attached. What did it say, you ask?
Written on it was: I hope you enjoyed your last moments with her. A smily face was next to it.
