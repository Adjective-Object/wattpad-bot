I open my eyes against the sheets and turn to face the glowing numbers on my alarm clock.
5:38 a.m.
Ugh! I face Tony, who is finally fast asleep and sigh. I wander into the living room with only tripping on my pants leg twice, and flop on the couch with a rather loud thud. The t.v. glows and I squint temporarily blind, and try to flip through channels before finding one playing Supernatural reruns. I lay down and watch Dean and Sam kick butt.
I feel warm arms scoop me up and I slowly open my eyes against a AC/DC tee shirt.
"Shhh.......we're going to bed," Tony whispers as I stir against his chest. He kisses my forehead before slowly struggling back to bed.
He lays me down and cuddles to the back of me while I snuggle into the blankets. Warm air cascades over my neck as he gently breathes on my neck.
~TIME SKIP BROTHA~
Light peaks through the curtains and I feel an absence in the bed. I roll over to see Tony gone. I get up while slipping a hoodie on and walking to find Tony in the kitchen with Bruce. Coffee is poured and laughs exchanged as I watch from behind a door.
"You're lucky. Any guy would die to have their hands on her," Bruce said looking at Tony. He just nodded.
"You're right. But I don't plan letting rapunzel from her tower."
