Ruby POV
Tash has been acting really weird ever since she got that phone call a week ago.
Natasha POVI keep getting texts and calls from the same unknown number. They all basically say the same. Ruby is hiding something big from me....I wanna trust her I really do. But I can't help but question "can I?"  I get knocked out of my thoughts when ruby sits beside me "babe what's been going in with you? You've been acting diffrent." She says looking at me. " Ruby....what are you hiding from me?" She looks at me shocked and stutters " W-what are you talking about?". "Ruby please...all I what you to do is be honest with me....so what are you hiding?" I looked at her waiting she sighed and looked at me " I'm engaged " my heart dropped "W-what? Engaged?" Ruby nodded and looked into my eyes " yes but I love you only you. She means nothing to me." I got up and walked downstairs trying to process this. She's fucking engaged? Ruby followed me "its not as bad as it seems." I turned around " what the Fuck do you mean it's not as bad as it seems?! Ruby you kept this from me! Your cheating! Oh my gosh I'm sleeping with an engaged woman. How could you!? " I shouted fighting back tears . " but I LOVE YOU NOT HER! Can't you see that?! Let me explain!" She yelled back " WHAT IS THERE TO EXPLAIN RUBY?! Just get the Fuck out! You don't love me. " I pointed to the door " Yes I do Natasha!" She said grabbing my hand. I pushed her away " DON'T touch me. Just go. You claim you love me huh? You have a damn funny way of showing it. " Ruby stared at me her face red before leaving slamming the door I fell to the floor sobbing. Not because I was alone, not because she is all I have, but because I've fell inlove with an engaged Ruby Rose. I started throwing things screaming " I hate you ruby rose i hate you." When that was a total lie. What I really meant was " I love you ruby rose. I wish I was the only one who has you. "
