"Baby you come and annoy me, kiss up on me, we have sex and then done until you're horny again, in the moment it feels like we are making love but then after we done its like sex. You roll off of me and lay." I said honestly. "The girls, they just ugh. They do whatever they want and run a muck. We seriously have to talk about discipline." I said.
"I'm sorry you feel that way baby. I try and show emotions to you and you don't respond." He said.
"That's because I don't want to be bothered after we have sex or after I'm done cleaning or whatever I'm doing." I said.
"So what would you like me to do babes?" He asked.
"I would like for us to have more us time." I said.
"Okay. We can do that. More dates, less sex, more making love." He said.
"Yes babes. Thank you." I kissed his lips.
"About the girls." He said.
I sighed. We had talked back a while ago and I didn't want to hit the girls but now I'm ready to beat them. Not just a little pop pop anymore.
"Yes baby?" I asked hoping he wouldn't say I told you so.
"We should have started disciplining them a long time ago."
The girls get punishment from time to time, but they have never gotten beatings.
"I know but Melanie and Cara so cute! Who wants to beat them?" I asked.
"Apparently you now." He said.
"It's just that the girls do whatever. Leave their shoes around the house. Run and play. They aren't disrespectful but uhh." I said confused with my feelings.
"How about I talk to the girls huh sweetie?" He asked and I nodded.
"Meanwhile baby, go upstairs and sleep." He told me.
"The food." I said.
"Devin is taking a nap he will be sleep for maybe another hour and a half get your rest and I'll make sure the girls eat." He said and I nodded.
"Thank you husband." I said and he smirked slapping my butt.
"You're Welcome baby."
I went upstairs and did exactly what he told me to do; sleep. It seems like I have gotten less and less of it as time went on.
Devin's POV
"Girls." I said going into their playroom.
"Yes." They said in unison.
"I have some news." I told them.
"What is it?" Cara asked excitedly.
"It's not good."I warned and she pouted.
"Aw no." She said covering her ears.
"Mommy and I are very upset." I told them.
"Mommy upset w-with me?" Cara asked.
They only care about Lauren's feelings I'm convinced.
"No. We are upset with the behavior the two of you showcase." I said.
"What we do?" Melanie asked.
"I notice that you two do not listen. Mommy does a lot for us and our family so when she asks you to do something do it baby girls. She doesn't ask for much but for you to keep your play room clean, make your beds, don't eat in here and pick up your shoes and things." I said.
