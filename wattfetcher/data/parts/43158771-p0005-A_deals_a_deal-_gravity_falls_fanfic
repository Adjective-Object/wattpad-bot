BillðŸŽ©Ahh shooting star! Shes the perfect pawn in this game! So easy to manipulate! Well, shooting stars look best when they fall... And she'll fall HARD after this!
MabelðŸ’«As soon as a walk down stairs, i get the weirdest feeling... Like I'm being watched. My first instinct is to close the window blinds. Instead, i walk over to the kitchen and sit down. I rub my forehead. Dumb feeling, go AWAY! Sorry shooting star! BILL!? What are you doing in my head?!? I didn't make a deal with you!?Well i had to improvise! Uggh! Go away!Sorry shooting star! Theres something i- we, need to do first.Ands whats that?Suddenly, the feeling worsens, like someones staring right at me. Then someone shoves me. Woah! I try to rub my forehead again... But i... Cant.BILL! What did you do!?!?"Sorry shooting star! Just need to borrow you for a moment!" Bill said through my mouth. I can see, but i cant move... Like bill pushed me away, took control, but let me watch and hear him. Then dipper walks down stairs.DIPPER!! Thats not me!!! Its bill!!! HELP!!!I try to shout, but nothing comes out. He doesn't even notice"Hey p- dipper!" Bill/me says. He walks over to... Maybill, i guess. Its like bipper, for me... Anyways... "So, mabel. Were are Wendy and Soos, aren't we gonna help them?" "Oh yeah." Maybill says. "Wendy's helping Soos fix a light bulb... I better help them... Wait here..." He stares at maybill "why cant i come?" He says, confused. "Because your short!" Maybill says, laughing. He did NOT just tease dipper about being short... Maybill smiles "anyways... You can come... But i don't think Soos or Wendy has a ladder tall enough for you!" Maybill jokes. Dippers eyes fill with tears as maybill goes on to tease him. "Im going back upstairs..." He says, turning around and wiping his eyes with his shirt sleeve. "Aww... Is little dipper gonna cry? Yea yea yea, you go upstairs. Maybe someone CARES about you up there!" Maybill says after him. I was horrified. What did you do THAT for!?!? He HATES me now!?!? Sorry shooting star! But its not over yet! Im sticking around for a while yet!WHAT!?Poor little pine tree doesn't know whats goin on yet!What are you doing this for!?Not gonna tell you! You can have control though...And with that, i got back control. "DIPPER!!!" I yell and run upstairs. "Go away" i hear him say. "But-" he cuts me off "your were right! The only thing that I care about at the the moment is the the journal! And I WANT to finish WHAT I STARTED so leave me ALONE!" He shouts. I jiggle the door knob, its locked. "That wasn't me!" I say, pounding on the door. "GO AWAY!" He screams. I freeze. Tears fill my eyes. I take a step back and walk down stairs, wiping my eyes.Thanks a LOT bill...Your welcome!
