I hauled a Taxi and hastily climbed into it. " l..long Is..land s..sound," I stammered. It was the first time that I had traveled in a taxi.
The driver looked back," first time, eh? You alone, kid?"
I faced him and said," yes and yes."
"You do have money, right? I'm not running a charity buisiness," he asked, an edgy tone creeping into his voice.
"y..yeah," i stammered, getting more and more nervous.
"Pricey fair, kid," the driver said, his voice much calmer.
"look, I haven't come here to have a conversation. Just get me to Long Island Sound," I said.
The driver grunted but started the car and redirected our path towards Long Island Sound. I guess my tone must have come out harsher than I wanted to because the driver didn't say another word on the ride. Mountains and lakes raced past us.
It was almost night when we arrived. The driver pulled over and said," this is as far as I go." He checked the metre then said," that'll be 55 dollars please."
I staggered out of the car and payed up. "what? no tip?" the driver glared at me.
"What do you expect from an orphan?" I muttered, a tear leaking from my eyes.
"oh sorry, didn't know," the driver said in a soft voice. I just nodded and turned. The taxi pulled out and drove away.
I took out the slip and read it. I wasn't far now.
