"Take" Mrs.Carter gave me the bandages and sanitizer "Thank you" I pushed Damon's hand away then sat and put Leena's head on my thigh ... I got lost in that angelic face with these little pink puffy lips and tall eyelashes CONCENTRATE SIMON!!
"Get out, Damon" His eyes widened.
"I said get out, I'll have to take her hijaab off" I shooed him.
"And why will you stay" I sensed jealousy in his tone.
"JUST GET OUT" Elina pushed her brother out and locked the door.
"I hope she forgives me" I unwrapped her hijab.
"WOAH" I gasped, she's so beautiful.
"WILL YOU HELP HER OR DID YOU ONLY DO THIS TO TAKE IT OFF AND STARE ?" Elina woke me up with a slap "Sorry" I apologized and started to clean her cut.
I covered the injurie "It's just a simple cut, no need to worry.Now, she'll just need some rest. I'll go get her a medicine for headache just in case ... by the way, she'll wake up in half an hour or so, you can also spray some water on her face" I carried Leena and lied her on bed then pulled the sheets over her.
"Thanks Simon" Mrs.Carter smiledØŒ I looked at the sleeping beauty, White skin and long black hair.
I must stop I shouldn't be looking at her.
"Something wrong ?" Elina asked.
"No *pause* nice closet by the way" My eyes widened at the opened closet.
It's been well-organized, all the clothes are still un-touched with the labels on and has been hung on reffering to their color from red to white like a rainbow, it also contained an accessories' & perfumes' section right beside the jewelleries from silver to diamond ... Heels, shoese and Vans ...  Plus, a food section and a little fridge !!! Snickers, Kitkat, Galaxy, Bounty, Chips, Lollipops, Gummy bears jar AND A FREAKING POPCORN MACHINE.
"Woah, believe me, I'm surprised as much as you" Elina's eyes widened with her mother's.
"I should go to the pharmacy, Bye" I waved at them.
"Meow"
"Did you hear it ?" I froze.
"What ?" Mrs.Carter asked.
"Meow"
"This !!" I raised my eywbrows in surprise.
"Meowwwww"
"There's a cat in my house !!!" Mrs.Carter freaked out.
"It's in the closet" I pushed the clothes aside and there it was ... A little white fluffy kitty with a huge pink bow around her nick ... it's probably a 'She'.
"Awwwh" Elina smiled.
"How did you get here Ms.Fluffy" I raised the kitty until it has become in front of my face.
"HOW ?? " I shouted.
"Meow" The baby kitten started to shake, we exploaded in laughter.
"Gi'mme dis, you devil" Elina snapped it from me and I giggled. I noticed a pink paper in the box the kitty was in.
Take care of it, cuppycake.
I don't think that you can throw it out the wondow with the other new contents in the closet
Ps: Sorry I threw yout old things because there weren't enough room for the mini fridge.

I slided the paper in my pocket "Bye" I opened the door and found Damon with his ear on it.
