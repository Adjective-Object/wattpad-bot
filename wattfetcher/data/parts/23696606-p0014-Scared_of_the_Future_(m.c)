Lilith's POV~~~~~~~~~~
I was running through a forrest, I had no idea how I got there, nor did I know why I was running. The only thing I knew was that I was afraid, lost, and running from something that felt dangerous. I heard a branch snap from behind me, and I abruptly stopped and turned around. There was no one to be seen or heard. The only sound was the winds and my heavy breathing. Once I got my breath back, I turned back around to run but was met with someone standing there. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't, Not from the surprise of someone behind me, but because of who was standing there. I felt tears filled my eyes as I spoke so quietly that I almost didn't heard myself. "...Luke?"~~~~~~~~~~~~I jumped up screaming, throwing the blanket that was on me off. "Hey, hey! Calm down!" I felt someone grab my shoulders from my side,"Ashton?" I asked, gasping for air. "Yeah, its me" He smiled at me and pulled me in for a hug. I hugged right back and let a few tears fall. "You're alright. Nightmare?" I felt Ashton's voice vibrate through my body and it calmed me down slightly. I nodded and hugged him tighter. "You seem to be having a lot of those" He sounded concerned as he spoke. I pulled away rom the hug and said., "Yeah, I guess. I've been having those since I ended up at the hospital. But this time... It was painful. I swear I can feel my heart hurting." I placed a hand on my chest and felt my heart beating at a quick pace.
"May I ask... what it was about?"I bit my lips and looked Ashton in the eyes and replied quietly., "My brother" Ashton frowned and put a hand on my knee. "I'm sorry" I nodded and looked out the window. "I had this other dream too, you know. A really weird one." I laughed slightly and looked back at Ashton. "I dreamt that Michael was an angel, and archangel actually." Ashton looked down at his hand. "That...that wasn't a dream Lillian." I could literally feel the colour drain from my face. "How do you know my real name? And what do you mean it wasn't a dream?" I stood up from my sitting position on the couch, and walked backwards towards the window.
"It's real. The whole God, angels, demons, the devil stuff. It's all real. And I'm one of them. The angels, like Michael." Ashton tried to explain. I now had my back against the wall and he stood up as well. "A-an archangel?" I stuttered. Ashton half-smiled and shook his head. "No, just a regular angel. My God given name is Azrael, angel of Death and retribution. Don't live up to that though." He now stood in front of me. "Michael, the oldest of the angels, is the leader of our 'military'. Our guardian angel." I looked up at him with a slightly scared look. "And your pal Calum... Well, his real name is Camael. He was an archangel, leader of the powers," I gulped nervously. "Was?" I asked and Ashton laughed bitterly. "Yeah, was. He betrayed us, he fell out of heaven. He's a demon now, and thats why I advice you to stay the hell away from that ignorant, selfish son of a-"
"Ashton." Ashton was interrupted by Michael who stood in the doorway with a bag over his shoulder. "Stop." Michael looked pained, as if the words hurt him. "Sorry..." Ashton looked at me. "I'm so sorry Lilith, I didn't mean to lash out at you like that." He apologised and backed away. "I'll just show myself out, see you guys later." As Michael and I was staring each other down, we heard the door click shut. I was all alone with Michael, and it scared me to death. He took his bag off his shoulder and put it carefully down on the couch I had woken up on only minutes ago. he slowly made his way towards me, and if I could back further into the wall, I would've. When Michael saw how terrified I was, he stopped and took a step back. "Please, Lilith, don't be scared of me" he sobbed quietly struggling to hold back the tears. I must admit, I felt bad for him. Michael was looking at he ground, one of his hands wiping his eyes. I gathered all the courage I could find and stepped forward. I slowly made my way towards him until he was within reach. I hesitantly raised my hand up to his face and put it against his tearstained cheek. Michael seemed surprised as he jumped slightly when my skin touched his. He looked at me with teary eyes and I returned the favour. Before I knew what I was doing I pulled Michael in for a hug. I grabbed him tightly, like my life was depending on in. He returned the hud with the same grip and he nuzzled his head into my neck. "I'm not scared" I whispered. "Not anymore"
