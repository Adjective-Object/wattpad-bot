she passed yesterday.
she went home, straight into Calums arms.
We all knew it wasn't going to get better, she passed in her sleep, peacefully and no longer in pain.
we all tried to keep the tears away but, to see a person you saw as a sister or a friend go through that, it wakes up memories.
like how Cal introduced us to her,
how her smile brightened the day.
her laugh was beautiful.
it was like an angel.
I remember how her laugh and smile disappeared when Cal died.
when calum jr was born her smile came back.
she had found new hope and new happiness.
we all sat in her living room this morning.
we where looking through the box we found under her bed.
it had a brown book in it.
it help poems and letters and copies of suicide notes she had once used but didn't need.
the letters and poems where directed to calum.
we where going to keep it and read it as time passed.
there where then pictures of all of us.
group pictures.
Christmas pictures.
cute pictures.
pictures of her and cal.
we looked at them all one by one.
calum jr was resting on malis knee.
"mama" he said looking and giggling at a picture of cal and her.
this was calum jr first word.
this was something she was meant to witness.
I came to the realisation that there are alot of things she wont be able to witness.
his first word.
his first steps.
his first day of school.
his prom.
his first girlfriend.
his first break up.
his wedding.
his first child.
being called grandma.
I sighed a contract today, a contract for a record label.
I was going to keep my promise.
