I'm crying
And I don't know
If these are happy
Or sad tears.
I love life-
I love to be able to notice
The trees and the forest,
The water, the moss,
The sunset,
Everything.
But I hate life.
I love to hate it.
I love to cry here and listen
To the music that
Nobody knows about.
I shut out
The whole world
Like this alot.
I'm so weak
But so full of strength.
I am dead
But alive with electricity.
I am so comfortable
Being here right now.
I love who I have become
But I understand that
Not many people would.
But I do.
And nobody stays there
Forever.
But I do.
Nobody sees the real me.
But I do.
And that's enough
To get me from day to day.
It's enough to fuel
My love to hate
Everything.
