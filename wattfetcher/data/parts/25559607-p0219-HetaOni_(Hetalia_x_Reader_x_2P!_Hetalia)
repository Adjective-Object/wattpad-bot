"Italyyy! West is so cold!" Prussia whined.

Italy couldn't help but chuckle a little. "Ahaha! But when we woke up in the morning, Prussia and (Name) were gone. We were really surprised!"


"Prussia was with France, right?" Japan asked.


The albino nodded. "Yeah, he was trying to open the door, and I thought it was that monster again."

"Victory goes to the one who makes the first move!! Go to hell!!" Prussia shouted as he swung the door opened and charged outside.


//outside the hall//


"Aaargh! You cut my clothes and my arm!" a man shrieked in pain as Prussia attacked, causing the albino to stop.

Prussia squinted his eyes and looked again. "France...? Wh-what the hell, man? You scared the shit out of me..."

"Oh? You were here? Hey, there, what's the matter? Do you want to sit down?" France asked. He was a bit injured, but he finds his friend's distress more alarming.


//back inside the fireplace room//


"What am I going to do with this?!" France said, wincing in pain a little.

Prussia's eyes widened. "Oh, I-I'm sorry! Hold on, I think there's a cloth over there..." he said, looking around. There was a cloth in the corner of the room, so he took it and handed it to his friend.

"Really, that isn't like you, now is it? Getting scared like that and attacking people~" France joked.

Prussia raised an eyebrow. "Now, wait a minute. How come you're just fine?

I mean, we got the message saying you were here and came after you. How can you be all right?"


"What? But we just got here! America, Russia, and Canada are exploring the first floor right now, and China and England are checking out the third floor." France told him.

Prussia's eyes widened in confusion. "Huh?! You gotta be fucking kidding me!We've been here the whole day! I'm at the limit of my strength, too."

"Well... you look like it, too. And even after all this commotion, these three still won't wake up." France said, looking over the three men sleeping soundly.
