She flirts with disaster
But dances with the stars.
She's ice cold
But she's living on Mars.
I'm not good at rhyming
But I am good at poetry.
I know she's got a million
Eyes on her but she sees me.
I love summer but
I love the dark.
Maybe I'm the ocean
Or maybe I'm the shark.
I can't tell the end from the start.
She's some work of art.
But why would I be the one her gaze falls upon?
When I'm the dark and she's my dawn?
But if she were dawn,
I'd start to love it as much
As I do the dark.
