Erin's POV
"Are you -- you're not seriously nervous right now, are you? I can tell." He said.
"Yeah." I said into my hands resting my elbows on the table.
"Hmm." He said making me more nervous and wonder what he was thinking.
"Jordan?" I asked.
He continued to just stare at my face like before, only this time he looked nervous too. "Jordan, are you okay?" I asked.
"Well -- umm -- sort of, can I ask you something a l -- umm -- something a little -- I don't know." He said.
"Ask me." I said.
"Do you want to move in together?" He asked.
"I've been waiting for you to ask me that." I said.
"Really? Well do you want to?" He asked dragging out the words.
"I'll think about it." I said smiling nodding my head yes.
After dinner I called Boo too say goodnight.
"Hi." She said.
"Hey, Boo." I said.
"When am I gonna be home?" She asked.
"Monday, but we might stay at Jordan's for a little."
"Monday? That's a long time, thats... four days."
"Yeah, you still want to see your daddy, right?" I asked.
"Yeah, but then I can see you and then daddy again and then you and daddy. It's not like I'm not gonna see daddy anymore." She said.
"Yup." I said looking at Jordan as he asked when I would tell her. "I don't know." I said putting the phone against my chest.
"Mommy?"
"Yeah, huh?" I asked after realizing I didn't hear what she just told me.
"Never mind. Daddy want me to go, bye." She said.
"Aww bye, Boo. I love you." I said.
"BYE!" Jordan screamed.
"Bye mommy, bye Jordan. I love you." She said directing it to both of us.
"She loves you, she said it herself." I said after gaging up the phone and punching him.
"You know... we have to tell her at some point." He said.
"Well I don't know for sure yet."
"You should still tell her I asked."
"I will tell her if I say yes."
"Please say yes, Erin." He said putting his hand on my thigh.
"I need time to think, Jordan." I said.
"Alright." He said putting his head on my shoulder.
"I love you and I know Boo does too, but I dont know if I'm ready to live with you. I -- I want to... really bad, but... Boo might not want too and... there are other things. I'm sure you don't want me and Boo around twenty four seven." I said.
Jordan's POV
I finally did it, I asked her to move in. Erin said she really wanted to... so I think she might.
"I wouldn't mind having you guys around all the time, we basically already spend every day together."
"That -- I want to move in together."
"Really!?" I asked.
