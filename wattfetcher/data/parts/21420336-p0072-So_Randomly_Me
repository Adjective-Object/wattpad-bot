Okay guys so
What if
Our lives were actually books
And people from the books we read
Read our lives
And it's like
WE ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS
AND OTHER FICTIONAL CHARACTERS THINK WE ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS
AND THEY OBSESS OVER US
AND THEY THINK WE ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THEY CAN RELATE TO US
;-;Gods this is why you don't leave me alone for more then five minutes
But seriously
Can you imagine that?
Like Nico just obsessing over people like us?Like"Sandy was just an annoying little nerd with no life at all who loved wattpad."
Actually that's stupid xD
