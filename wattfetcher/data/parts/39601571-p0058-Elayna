I want to have a contest.
Like the winner could get a prize.
I was thinking that I could order something online if MagCon ( cuz like everyone on here is a fan of MagCon I think) and then who ever won I can send it to u.
But there r 2 things wrong with that.
1) I don't know what I would have you guys do. like a book cover maybe? But that's so over used
2) I would need your guys address and I don't know if you would be comfortable about that. and what about your parents?
And who would want to join?
Leave in the comments on what you think I should doðŸ˜Š
