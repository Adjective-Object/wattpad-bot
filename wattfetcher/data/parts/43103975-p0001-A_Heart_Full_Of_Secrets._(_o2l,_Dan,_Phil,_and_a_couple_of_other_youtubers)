What if I said I was dancer, and actor? What if I said I was a famous youtuber? What if I said I was best friends with o2l, Dan and phil? What if I said I lived in London? Would you believe me?
No?
What if ever since I was little, I would keep secrets? What if I knew something that could kill me?
Hi I'm Rosalie Martin.
I have natural wavy red hair, with purple bangs that cover the left side of my fore head. With green eyes, glasses, and very pale skin. My bottom lip, on the right side is pierced. I have a tattoo of a flower on my right shoulder with a vine coming from it that wraps around my arm and ends on my pointer finger. I'm tall and pretty slim. I'm slim because I dance.
Yes I'm a dancer, and actor. I am a pretty famous youtuber, with 8,000,000 subscribers. My best friends are o2l, Dan, and Phil. And I live in London. Do i sound normal?
Wrong.
Ever since I was little, people would tell me secrets,  trusting me to keep them. Each and everyone I have kept. I haven't even told my secrets. My heart is full of secrets. One secret will kill me.
My life is far from normal.
Lets just hope my friends can help me through.
Before I snap.
