Hello :)
I feel like I write way too much in this bookðŸ˜‚
As you can see I updated anxiety! Hoot hoot!!! My wifi is back!
I think it's my favorite chapter so far ðŸ˜Œ the chapter name is "Rainy Days"
Could you guys please write your thoughts on the chapter?
Also maybe some writing suggestions? I asked my best friend what I should have the next chapter about but she's lame and has no good ideas ðŸ˜’ you know who you areðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚
But really, should I start writing child hood memories in the book? Like 'Rainy Days'?
Comment on Anxiety not here please! I just don't want everything to be all over the place.
Thanks :)
