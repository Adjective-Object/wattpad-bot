Silentfeather took a deep breath before smiling at the young apprentice. "I'm fine," he replied.
Doveflight let out a sigh of victory as she watched Silverpaw with pride. "From now on she will be known as Silverpool," she announced the new name to the group.
Every medicine cat began to cheer and chant her name. Everyone besides Silentfeather, he was still drifting in his dreams, not being able to think properly. He did manage to depart from the dream after and he congratulates Silverpool of her success.
Before long, the cats decided to finally make their way back to camp as the night ticked on.

In the distance, somewhere outside of the borders of the clan's life stood a beautiful fall painted she-cat. She climbed up a fence that usually trapped the horses inside and looked around the area. The moors, the wetlands, the marshlands and the woodlands were silent and peaceful as a gliding Nightingale.
A smirk drew at the she-cat's lips as she watched the four territories. "Home sweet home," she laughs violently and than sneered, "did you miss me?"
"Are you ready for my pleasant revenge? Because I know I am."
