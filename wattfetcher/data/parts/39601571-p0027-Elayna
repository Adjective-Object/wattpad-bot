Hello :)
It's super late but I'm bored 😕
BUT! I wanted to ask something😊
Should I start asking you guys questions then giving my answer?
Like as an example.
Blah blah blah ( what ever I'm talking about )
Then the end will be this:
Q- do you guys have any internet best friends? Tag them
A- I have a lot of friends online actually. On WattPad I have the most and vine comes up as a close second :)
But it would be a different question every time.
Then you guys can answer in the comments👇🏼🍄
So answer both questions down below to see what you guys think!
Internet friends and if I should do the questions 😊
Bye 👋🏼
