he doesn't really like her.
she likes him, she would give him her all if he gave her the chance.
dark and lonely, she only needs someone to hold her.
grown and horny, he only wants someone to caress.
drugs and age and drinks and rage, she will grow up.
school and parties and jobs and girls, he will forget.
