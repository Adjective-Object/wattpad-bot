Alodia pouted even more, which Lethe didn't even think was possible to do with the face. "No! That's an incredibly stupid plan, and you know it!" Alodia put her free hand on her hips, and stayed silent for a moment, before continuing. "You know what? I'm going to help you."
"What?"
"I'm going to help you! I'm bored, I have nothing to do, and this is important to you, right? Then I'll help you."

"Don't worry! I know some people who can help us with this, and I know a few tricks up my sleeve. I know where we should probably go next, and you don't know where that is. Let's face it: you need me, Lethe."
"But-" Lethe tried to say, but Alodia pulled on Lethe, which made Lethe fall onto the ground with a loud thud.
"Wow, it's like you don't know how to use your legs."
"I don't."
"Really? Strange, what kind of human doesn't know how to use their legs? But anyways, I guess you need me even more than I thought, huh? So will you let me help you?"
Lethe gave it some thought: would she really allow this girl, who gave her name to a complete stranger and expected the same in return, to help her? Lethe would prefer to do it alone, as she had more freedom about her choices. On the other hand, this girl was the closest thing she had to a lead.

Alodia smiled with a hint of mischief in her eyes, and pulled Lethe once more, keeping her arms around Lethe's waist so that Lethe wouldn't fall. "Alright, then let's start with you learning how to walk."
