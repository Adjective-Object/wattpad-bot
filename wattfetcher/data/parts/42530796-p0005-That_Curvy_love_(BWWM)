"Need a ride I would be happy to give it to you"  in more ways then one Evan thought to himself  "Um yes thank you" wow u didn't thinks he was going to say yes but thank you god Thought the whole ride they both were completely silent Evan would peek over at Ashley every now and then and he caught her peeking at him too a few times
They made it to the bakery and Evan literally ran to her door to open it for her She muttered a quiet thank youThen started off to the bakery but stopped and turned around "Thank you for the ride Evan" she said seductively "No problem" he replied back He walked back to his door then something hit him how is she going to get homeHe walked into the bakery looking for Ashley but he spotted that girl from yesterday that ketp flirting with him ,if didn't want to hurt her feeling if he told her I don't like skinny straight lines  truth be told that's all she is She then started waving him over ,he reluctantly walked to her "So u came to see me again""Sorry no I looking of Ashley" she looked like a little kid that just lost their favorite toy when he said that "Umm she's not her yet" lying ass I just dropped her off "I know for a fact she is here I dropped her off this morning" her eyes bulged out of her head ,what's her problem it's not like I'm your boyfriend or anything "Can you just go get her for me" he asked nicely and shot her a charming smile She nodded and went off to the back where she soon retured with Ashley and stayed right here by us so she can easedrop I guess.So I whispered in her ear "Would you like me to pick you up later your cars is not here" I then backed away from her to see her face She just nodded and said a quiet "yes" she's so cute and sexy but doesn't realize but I am going to help her see it.
