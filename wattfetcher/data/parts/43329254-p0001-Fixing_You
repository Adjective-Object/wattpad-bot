Bradley Atkins had all he could have ever wanted.
The mansion.
The fancy cars.
The ladies.
Until one mysterious evening when he was attacked in his house by a mysterious 'someone' in a white mask, pushed down the stairs, shot and left for dead.
However it didn't quite turn out that way.
Instead his life is left in the hands of on a live in nurse. Cassandra Rose Moon. She has one purpose.
To fix him.
