I see a long hall. I walk down and see a door on the end. I go through the door and see my family. I happily run to see them, but as they see me coming, they turn their backs on me.
"Guys," I start.
"Shut up," my mom snarls. "We don't need you anymore."
"We've already found the replacement," Anastasia says.
"She's much better than you," Ava adds.
"We've had the replacement ready for a while," Natasha continues. "We have been waiting, but now we've waited too long."
"What are you saying," I exclaim frantically.
"You don't know," my dad scoffs. "Well, that's no surprise. You have always been dumb. We mean, it's time for you to go."
"No," I exclaim. "Please, why are you doing this!"
They ignore me and start slowly advancing on me.
Suddenly, a door opens behind me. I rush through it and slam it shut. I collapse onto the floor and start crying.
"Not so much a big happy world, is it? I've known that for a while."
I look up and see Golden.
"G-Golden," I ask. He nods. "Is this real?"
"Yes...and no," he replies. He sits down next to me. "You see, you're dreaming. But...you're dead. However, things you see in this dream are true, such as your family's plans."
"Oh...Wait, so you're really here...or, just in my dream thing?"
"Well," he says. I am visiting you in your dream. I am awake, and you are asleep. I have come into your mind. Follow me."
He gets up, and so do I. He leads me down another hall and through another door.
Inside, is Lexie, Ty, and Jaydon.
"Hi guys," I say.
Lexie is on the ground, asleep, and Ty and Jaydon are sitting on chairs in the back. Both boys jump up and run over to me as I come in.
"Oh, fudge," Jaydon exclaims.
"Your ok," Ty exclaims.
"Jeez, guys," I say. "Of course I am...I think."
Lexie wakes up, takes one look at me, and faints.
"Lexie was the last one to be killed. She's kinda shocked to see us," Jaydon explains.
"Oh," I say. I look at Golden. "So...whats gonna happen to us?"
He sighs. "I don't know. Vincent is just cruel. I-" he suddenly disappears with a shriek of pain.
"Wha..." Ty says.
Lexie wakes up and yawns. "So lemme get this straight," she slurs. "I am seeing you guys, even though we're all dead?"
"Yes," Jaydon says. "However, Golden has just disappeared. While screaming in pain."
"Oh..." Lexie says.
Suddenly, a voice calls out, "Children..."
"What was that," I ask.
"I don't know," Lexie says with a shrug.
"Its ok," the female voice whispers. "I am a friend. This may be the only time we may talk. However, I must give you...gifts." Four boxes suddenly appear in front of us. Each one has one of our names on it. "Open your box." We open the boxes. Mine has a head that looks like a fox, with rosy red cheeks, and is white. I can't see the other's gifts, however. "I will now give you life. Give gifts, give life. Again."
