The class finally ended. I decided to use the fifteen-minute break that we were given to grab a quick bite at the canteen. I rushed to Neng’s Buns only to find out that there’s only one Peanut Bread left. To give you an idea on what I’m talking about, Neng’s Buns is the most famous bread stall here at ArchCross canteen. Their best-seller is… you guessed right - Peanut Bread. To think that it’s still 9:30 in the morning and their Peanut Bread is almost sold-out, their stall is really something! Good thing there’s still one left.
“Neng! Can I have that last Peanut Bread please? Please?”
“Sure, here you go.”
“Thanks Neng!”
As I was about to get the bread, someone snatched it away from me. What the fuck?!
“What the hell is wrong with –“I faced the bread thief and got surprised with the person I saw.
“Neng, I think you forgot that I reserved a Peanut Bread from you.”
“Are you kidding me, Ice? This is a Bread Stall! First Come, First Served!” I can’t give that Peanut Bread up. I need it to freaking function!
“Be the Student Council President then. That way, you’ll get special treatment just like I do.” He gave me a smile – a smile so mocking that it will pop your eyes out. “And oh, you need to see me after school. You’re the only Class President who forgot to send in their Schedule Adherence. Talk about responsibility. Heh.”
“...” I wasn’t able to say anything. I was left speechless and humiliated. He was correct though – I was the only one who did not submit our class’ Schedule Adherence Record. But, I never for once thought that this bastard can be as evil as this. What happened to the quiet, lonely Ice? Was everything for show?
“Dammit! I’m hungry.”

==========================================================
I went to the Student Council room to send the Report. There was no one inside so I decided to wait. I can’t help but notice how organized the room is. Prolly’ the work of Mister Four-Eyed Bastard.
His desk is so clean that it made me cringe. Everything is in order – even his markers are arranged in a way that it followed the colors of the rainbow. Also, the books are stacked in an alphabetical manner. Talk about OCD. LoL.
“Surprised you got here in time.” Ice entered the room and called me out with his irritating voice. The fuck is this bastard smiling for?
“First time you got late to something? Heh!” Yes! That’s a clean hit!
“Hmm… Well, I guess you can say that. At least I don’t have a lot of recorded tardiness last year. Official lates are worse than things like this – you do realize that right?” That smile again! This fucker is really annoying the hell out of me.
“Can we just get to the business please? This is our class’ Schedule Adherence Report.”
“Okay. Nice to see that. Unfortunately, I already sent my records to the principal. Don’t you worry – Petal, your class’ Vice President, already submitted the report to me last week.”
“…” Am I hearing things correctly? If he already has the records, then why the fuck did he made me go here for? To annoy me? “Okay, you won. Sigh. You won, okay? Now, I’m going home.”
