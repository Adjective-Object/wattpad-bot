"Hi, I'm Alexis Little and I'm playing Summer" I shyly replied, massaging my hand.
"So you're Robert's mini me!"
"Yeah, I guess so. I didn't think anyone called me that, but okay"
"Well, you better get used to it! Anyway, nice to see you again Gwyneth and nice to meet you Alexis. I have to go meet with someone, but we'll talk later"
Chris waved us goodbye and left Gwyneth to drag me around and meet everyone else. Some people I met were really nice and either shook my hand or gave me a small hug. Others gave me a bone-crushing hug that lifted me off the ground. *cough. cough. Samuel. L. Jackson. cough. cough* He was nice about it, though.
Once I had shyly introduced myself to everyone, it was time to start the read through. I took my seat in between Robert and Gwyneth and took a look around the room. I couldn't help but smile as I thought to myself, I couldn't have asked for a better cast.
