"Thanks, Ollie."


"Don't mention it, poppet.


.....Take care."


"......You, too."

And at that, the girl walked through the mirror, leaving him all alone in the room.

Ever since (Name) came into their lives, things have slowly started to change. Be it his thoughts, his principles...and his heart.... There's something that just made it all so...different.


A good different.


Being the only person in the room, the cupcake-loving Brit found himself to be contemplating on so many things. He tried thinking of what he really came there to the mansion for.


Revenge, right?


They have a firm reason to want to get rid of the First Players, and that's what they'll hold on to. The only problem there was, was that their plans always get foiled because that Italian First Player managed to make a deal of going back in time to desperately find a chance of all of them escaping alive.

That still intrigued him, though. Usually, when he used cloning spells, the clones weren't supposed to take up a mind of its own and produce its own actions--along with manifesting its own powers, too. But, his older brother did say that sometimes, magically-produced clones can develop a mind of its own. Maybe that was the case. In all honesty, he didn't mind, but it was quite troublesome.


So everytime the First Player Italy were to rewind back time, they would follow after him. Since none of them died in the mansion and travelled back in time together, they didn't have to risk getting past selves, because they lived on the alpha timeline. They just kept going in circles, it was almost making them even crazier than they already were.


But now that they have (Name)...they were sure that this was the last time they'll go through this. They were sure that they'd be able to kill all of them. To get rid of those First Players once and for all. To make them feel how they felt when they tried ripping them of their existence, their purpose, their identities, their homes...everything... They were supposed to give them a taste of their medicine. ... That was the plan. To get rid of the First Players.
