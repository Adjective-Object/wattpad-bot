"Understood. Now, let's just forget about this incident and go to the other room." Japan said, motioning the others towards the door.
Germany agreed. "Right..."
The countries left one by one, leaving Italy and Germany at the tunnel.

"What have you been looking for?" Germany asked his friend who seemed to be searching for something.
"Huh?! N-nothing..." Italy stuttered.
Something on the floor suddenly caught Germany's eye. He decided to pick it up. Hm? What's this?
**Found "Piece of Metal".**
"Oh!!" Italy covered his mouth.
"Ah, so this is what I saw. It might be useful, so I'll take it with me." Germany said, placing the metal object in his pocket.
Italy started walking and mumbled, "Right..."
======================
//Reader's PoV!~//
While we were on our way back to the room where Italy wanted to talk, my head starting to hurt. I slowed my pace and let the others walk ahead of me. My vision started blurring again...
What's going on...?
Up ahead, I saw the others entering the room with the iron cell.
Oh...I remember...Italy's...going to trap them inside, right?
....Should I...stop them...?
...Yes...
I should...
Clutching my head, I started walking over to where the others were.
But then, I heard someone...
...chuckling behind me.
"Ehehe~... Where do you think you're going, ragazza?~"
I stopped dead in my tracks.
No.
No.
No.
I told them to leave me alone.
Ever so slowly, I turned around to face...him...
"...Wh...Why are you here...? I already told you guys that I'm not going to help you."
The man in front of me wore a tan military uniform, he had auburn hair and piercing magenta eyes...what made me shiver in terror, though...
...was the throwing knife he was swinging in front of him playfully.
He only smirked at me as he met my gaze.
Trying to feel brave, I clicked my tongue and turned away from him.
"I don't care what you guys are playing, but I have my own game to take care of. I am going to get out of here--with them, without any help from you guys. Now, leave us alone...because I already told you.... I'm not going to help you."
I was about to start walking once more, when I felt someone dash up to me from behind and wrap their arms around me...a cold blade placed on my cheek.
My breathing suddenly became heavy at the impending harm the Italian man could bring me. I took a deep breath before bravely speaking up,
"Let me go, Italy."
