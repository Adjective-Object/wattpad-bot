After everything that happened in the last few day I could have died. I walked outside after school to head home and get ready for the party and I saw Melissa and Quentin talking by the front entrance!!! Ok I know it's a bit lame but still!!! When I got home I started putting up decorations and getting food ready. When it was time for everyone to arrive I had just finished setting up and Melissa, Maddy and B showed up with their boyfriends behind them. Melissa with Quentin!!! Maddy with Reese! And B with her boyfriend Jake. After a while the party was in full swing. There were people everywhere, the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms. I was waiting for Jay when I saw Melissa and Quentin kissing on the couch!!! Omg i know for a fact that this was Melissa's first kiss and it was so romantic! Then I heard someone shout "boo!" In to my hear and I turned around to see Jay. I had a AMAZING night!
