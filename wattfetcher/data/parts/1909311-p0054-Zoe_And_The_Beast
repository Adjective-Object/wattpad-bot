Without thinking, I spun around and walked out the door, leaving him lying there on the couch. What was wrong with me? Why were all these thoughts suddenly washing through my brain? Had I fallen in love? Had Beast actually stolen my heart? Was I his pawn for revenge?

Was I putting my brother in danger?


A/N This was a short chapter. Very short, actually. I just thought of something I needed to adress...and there's something going on with Beast that's not...right. I don't know why, but he's always PMSing. I hope I don't turn him into a girl by the end of the story, haha :P
Picture of Zoe to the side!
