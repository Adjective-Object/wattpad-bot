WELL, THAT THING WAS SOMETHING FROM A FEW CHAPTERS AGO. I WONDER IF YOU GUYS CAN RECALL?


THAT SMALL METAL OBJECT WILL PLAY A SMALL BUT GREAT ROLE LATER. :D




>>America and England


â€”-The next chapter, Chapter 16: Darkness....is one of the *coughUSUKcough* America and England chapters that I always wanted to avoid...but couldn't. For those who know the game....you know how painful it is ;w; Right?


=*=*=*=*=*=


...Well, you guys might sense that there isn't much action here.....because that's for the next part O___O


BECAUSE THE NEXT CHAPTER CONTAINS SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU WERE WAITING FOR.

AND THAT INCLUDES.......


"THE LUCIANO VARGAS AND READER OF THE FIRST TIMELOOP"  arc..


...yeah yeah....I can't think of a more decent title for that arc, so I went for the straightforward one. xD


YES.


DRAFTING THAT CHAPTER WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME CRY ;W;


I'LL POST THAT IN ABOUT A WEEK, OR EARLIER IF OUR PROFESSORS WOULD GIVE US AN EARLY BREAK. ;W; I HOPE SO.

Again, I would like to thank everyone of my readers, followers, fans? (I don't really get it when people say 'fan' on Wattpad xD What does it mean? Do I even have fans? xD Electric fan? I've got lots of that at home. LOL.) , friends..etc! :") I love you all. Thank you for your support! Words cannot really express the joy that I am feeling right now, as well my gratefulness to God for blessing me with such results; blessing me with such results....and kindhearted readers.

I just... I don't know xD I'm being mushy. LOL.

FUN FACT: I swear, after I prayed before the exam...I reread all of your wonderful and heartwarming comments in my other author's note.

God gave me the strength, you guys gave me the inspiration.

Thank you so much.
