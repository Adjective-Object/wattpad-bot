Dipper interrupted me because who knew who I was going to say

Dipper:  ...Wendy?

Mabel: yeah.

Dipper: Mabel, no one could replace the real Wendy.

Mabel: you still like her, huh?

Dipper: I don't think I'll ever get over her. By by the way can we never talk about this conversation ever again.

Mabel: sure. Well now that we got the mattresses gone, we should probably tell Zoe and Mackenzie they can come up.

Dipper: yeah.

Mackenzie's P.O.V
Zoe and I hear a call from upstairs. It was Mabel.

Mabel: YOU GUYS CAN COME UP NOW!

We we walked up into the bedroom. I layer down in one mattress next to Mabel's bed, then Zoe lays down on the mattress next to mine on the left side. I must of been as tired as Zoe, because I fell asleep really quickly. But then I had a dream or a nightmare, and oh no, Bill Cipher was there. I don't remember any of it. Except for the fact it was me, Pacifica, Dipper, Mabel, and Zoe running away from Bill. But then I feel someone shaking me. I wake up and see Zoe.

Zoe: OMG! Are you ok?!

I saw Mabel and Dipper next to Zoe. They all had worried looks. i sit up.

Mackenzie: Zoe, I'm fine. I just had a really weird dream.

Zoe&Mabel&Dipper: phew

Mabel: let's head downstairs.

we all go downstairs. Dipper goes in front of the tv and turns it in to watch "ghost harassers" then I hear a knock at the door.

Mabel: I'll get it! That must be Candy and Grenda.

i grab Zoe's arm and drag her upstairs.

Zoe: hey what gives?

Mackenzie: Candy and Grenda? ghost harassers?

Zoe: OMG were in episode 10 of season two. northwest mansion mystery. Maybe we can go see Pacifica now.

Mackenzie: not a chance. We have to see her after

Zoe: ugh fine. But were still going to the party right?
