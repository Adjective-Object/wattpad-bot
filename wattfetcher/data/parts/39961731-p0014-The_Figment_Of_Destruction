"Really? Please. Impossible is nothing." I said as I left the class. I made my mark in there.
I made it through the rest of the day before going home. When I came inside the house, I found Logan doing homework.
"Hey, little bro." I said. "Are you doing homework?!"
"Hey, big man. And yeah. It's surprising." Logan answered.
"Yeah. Why are you doing it? You already did it once this week. Isn't that enough for you?" I questioned.
"It is, but I have to do it if I wanna be part of the class party we're having tomorrow." Logan responded.
"Really?" I raised my eyebrows at him.
"Yes. Only because I don't wanna do work tomorrow." He explained.
"Okay. If you say so. I wouldn't do it, even if it means no work. Just saying."
"Well, you don't really understand middle school. And if you don't do work, won't you fail high school?"
"I've been in middle school before. Remember that, little bro. And probably. But, here's the thing," I said while sitting next to him, "you have to annoy your teachers to the point where they can't stand you. At the end of the year, they'll move you on to the next grade or even college because they don't want you in their class another year."
Logan stared at me and took in the information I gave him. "Cool story. I'll use it."
"Great. Where's Mom?"
"Probably work. Or the store. Either one."
"Alright. Now, go to your room."
"Why?"
"I wanna watch TV."
"And why can't I stay here?"
"Do you want to get wasted off of food tomorrow?"
"Yeah?"
"Then go to your room to achieve that." Logan huffed, got his stuff, and left the living room. "See you later, Logy-bear!!"
"Don't call me that!" He yelled when I called him by his old nickname from Mom.
"Too late, Logy-bear!" I heard Logan run up the stairs and his door slamming shut. I laughed to myself.
I watched TV for hours and Mom wasn't back from work or the store or wherever she's at. I looked out a window and saw that it was dark. I got up from the couch and went to the kitchen to make some dinner.... for me only, of course. In the kitchen, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs and thought it was Logan. I checked the hallway for the stairs and found no one there.
I went back to the kitchen to continue making dinner. After about 10 minutes of silence, I heard something crash onto the hardwood floor. I ran into the small, open room next to the stairs and found Mom and Dad's big, framed wedding photo on the floor, broken into pieces.
"Logan!" I screamed.
"What?!" He screamed back.
"Come down here!" I demanded. I watched Logan come down the steps and stare at the broken picture.
"Woah, big man. I know you don't like Dad and all, but breaking his and Mom's wedding picture is just... woah." Logan said.
"I didn't do it and don't act innocent here." I glared at him.
"What do you mean?" He questioned me.
"You broke the picture." I stated.
