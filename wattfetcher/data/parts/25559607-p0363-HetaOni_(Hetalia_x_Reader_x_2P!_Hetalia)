"My name is (Second Name). What's your name little girl?"


"I'm (Name)! Nice to meet you!~"

Hearing the name of the girl made my chest feel heavy all of a sudden. It felt like there was something...familiar about it, too. Maybe I knew her before? Oliver did say that I knew so many people back then. He even told me we were good friends before...but I have no recollection about that whatsoever. It's kinda sad, especially when I saw Oliver look so heartbroken when I told him that I don't have any memories of him. Seriously, is it really possible for a person to hit her head that hard to forget so much? That's just...unfair.


Suddenly, I realised that I had spaced out for too long when the little girl tugged my jacket and spoke, "Hey, (Second Name), you okay...?"


"O-Oh! Yeah, sorry about that. Uhm, so you were saying you were here to play, (Name)?" I asked her, crouching down to be at eye-level with the little (h/c) girl.


Nodding, she grinned. "Yep! I actually got a li'l bored, so I looked for someone to play games with me." she placed a hand on my shoulder. "Wanna play?~"


"Uhh, well, I've got nothing else better to do. Alright." I replied.


She jumped in joy. "Hooray!~ Let's go!" she said, pulling me towards the door.


"Huh? Where are we going?" I gave her a puzzled look.


Turning to face me, she huffed. "We're going downstairs! I don't think it's fun here."


"What? I can't! Kuro told me to not leave this room..." I told her, frowning.


She pouted and crossed her arms. "Whaaat? Is that person your mommy?"


"Hahaha. No, he isn't my mommy." I laughed.
