"Talk to you later!" Stampy said. "Okay. Bye!" I said back.
"Bye!" I hit the "end" button. I can't believe that I just had a conversation with THE Stampylongnose! That has always been one of my biggest dreams! What a great day! I just hit 100 subscribers on my channel and from the way I see it, Stampy might even subscribe to me! What a day! "I'm so tired." I mumbled. I walked to the bathroom, took my makeup off, took a shower, and put on my Stampy and iBallisticsquid pajamas. They were so soft! Before I went to bed I got a text from Stampy saying,
"Would you like to start a new series on my channel called Sky den?"
I replied back saying,
"I would love to!"
"Great!"
"Is Monday a good day to start recording?"
"Fine by me!"
"Great!"
And with that, I went to bed smiling all night long.

"Good morning." I said to Little Sqaish. He yawned back at me in reply."Yes it's early, but the early bird gets the worm!"He ran into the back corner. My cat was rubbing herself on my leg. "Well your up very early!" She stretched and lay down on my foot as I said that. "Oops. I jinxed it." I whispered. Great thing my phone was in my pocket. I slid over to the nearest chair I could find and started to text Stampy. I took a picture of my kitty sleeping on my foot. "Sleepy kitty" I wrote to go with that. He replied back saying "Lol." I laughed.
"Do you think that I could play Minecraft in your lovely world soon?"
"That would be lovely."
"When do you think I can come on?"
"How about you come on Friday? U can be one of my helpers along with Lee Bear."

"Sounds good."
Yay! I get to record with Stampy! I can't wait! I have never played Minecraft on the Xbox before. This is gonna be a time to remember!
