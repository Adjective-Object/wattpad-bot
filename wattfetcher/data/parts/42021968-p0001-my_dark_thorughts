My life is not a fairy tale actually  its the complete opposite my life is a battel feild and i am the swords I'm dented scratched hit used to protect others I'm am  just nothing to them I'm mearly a thing to use dry then leave me there looking like a fool for believing  they were true friends but really  it was my stupidity beliving someone like them would  like someone like me. This is why I do the things I do hate the people  I hate I try to push these  thorughts out of my head bet they come back stronger every time.
My life is a mess like my wrist and my head the torughts got in I let them win because  the people at school I let them use e again it's not one or two it's the whole class now they are talking  behind  my back the ones I thought  we're my friends showed me wrong they try the hurt me but only I can do that the try to put me down I already  do that therapy nothing you can do to hurt  me only I can hurt myself.
