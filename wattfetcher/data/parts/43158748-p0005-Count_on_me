I smiled up to him"okay!"
Pit brought me back to my house, of course I  showed him the way.
"Again thanks for helping me with the song Pit, I can't wait to see you again!" I hugged him quickly, then I turned and ran inside, giggling.
Pit smiled brightly at that "Alright Lady Palutena, I'm ready to come home!" He said, and a bright light brought the little angle home.
Pit's P.O.V  When I got back to Skyworld, I couldn't help but tell lady Palutena all about her.
"Lady Palutena, I met this cute girl in the village I had to rest my wings in, and she's writing this really cool song and she even let me help! Neat huh?" I was nearly bouncing from excitement.
"That does sound neat, Pit." Palutena agreed, making me smile more.
Even Palutena thought it was cool "I'm gonna go back in a few days and see if she finished the song. I can't wait! "I smiled and ran out of the room, pretty excited now.
I went around, singing and humming that song for four days, I decided after four days, It was time to go back.
