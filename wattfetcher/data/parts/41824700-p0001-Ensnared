Not a red rose or a satin heart
I give you a cup of coffee

It is a rude awakening in a cup
It promises reality
like the harsh truths about love

Here
It will make you feel bittersweet
like a lover
It will make your reflection
a twisted portrayal of faith.

I am trying to be realistic.

Not a cute card or a kissogram
I give you a cup of coffee

Its sadistic clutch will remain in your system
possessive and unforgiving
as we are,
for as long as we are.

Take it
Its clingy taste will linger with me
No is not an option.
