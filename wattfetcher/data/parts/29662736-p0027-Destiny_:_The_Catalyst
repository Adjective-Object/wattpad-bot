I headed down stairs where my mom was in the family room. She was reading the newspaper and when she saw me, she put down the papers and looked at me weirdly.
Well look whose up she said with a smile. You passed out last night and Dylan dropped you off after the party, also he assured me you did not do alcohol. She smiled and I smiled back got out the back door, I needed some fresh air and clear my head of what all has been happening with me.
I shut the door and walked to the swing set, I sat down, took a deep breath, and closed my eyes, and I replayed what the builder told me that the universe responds to me. I saw a rose bud in my mom's garden; it was red and did not bloom yet.
I walk over to it and brushed it with my fingers and it started to bloom, it opened its pastels, showing of its beautiful colors and form. It became bright red.
However, than it started to turn brown, I panicked withdrew my hands away and watched it wither into a dead plant and then turn to dust.
