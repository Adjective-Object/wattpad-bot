Keegan's POV
"Keegan get up!" I heard my name being called, I got up sighing, I looked down and saw I was in a private jet. "Oh never mind." I said to myself, I stood up getting my bags, and blanket. "Good afternoon baby." Hayes looks my way, I roll my eyes and he does the same.
Cameron looks at me with sadness in his eyes and Nash looks at me for forgiveness. I really wish I did die when I almost got stabbed by Chloe. I can't be put through a lot of stress.
I walk out of the plane and walk towards the limousine, they put my stuff in the car along with the others, I get my beats and phone out playing music. "Keegan?" I hear my name again, "That's my name, don't wear it out." I said, "Can I speak to you." Nash said chuckling.
I smile to myself the stand up getting out of the car, "I'm really sorry, you know I've never would've called you that, I was just mad the fact that my best friend more like my brother slapped me, and it shocked me, that's why I told you to stay near Hayes." he said in tears, "He only hates you because our mom walked in on your mom and our dad." he continued, "Other than that I'm really truly sorry." he finished.
I hugged him when he put his arms on my shoulder I winced, "Did I hurt you?" He asked I shook my head quickly walking in the car, he sat across from me and went on Twitter following a couple of fans and giving them shoutouts.
Hayes and his girlfriend, Maxine, I rolled my eyes, "Okay, do you have a problem with me, if so I would love to know." She said, "Back off stay in your lane mine is on construction, now that you've entered." I said she shut up and sat next to Hayes slouching in her seat.
"Don't talk to my girlfriend like that." Hayes snapped, "Its called respect Hayes, she snapped at me I snap back she doesn't get to choose her decisions on to fight me or not because I would be knocking midgets like her." I said Nash and Cameron chuckled.
"Just don't talk to me." He said, "Was planing on too." I said, "Don't-" I cut Hayes off like Ima do to his throat. "Hayes shut up if you aren't gonna talk to me then don't geez!" I huffed. He scoffed I gave him one last look then glared at him.
"I will forever hate Hayes Grier." I mumbled to myself. He looked at me hurtful, it was around 12:00pm so I went into my hotel room that I had to share with Hayes and his girlfriend, I took a quick shower since no one was in here yet. When I finished I put on a crop tee that tied in the front and it was above my belly button, Aztec shorts, and my hot pink vans.
"Keegan can I talk to you?" Maxine asked me I sighed, "Fine!" I sighed again, she pushed me against the wall and I looked down at my phone to go on the voice record app, "Listen here little girl, back off Hayes, I heard you guys used to be close and I'd like to keep it that way. I'm just using him too...for fame and you better not tell him." She gritted through her teeth bringing her hand to my neck.
"Got it?" She said I nodded quickly she let me go and the door opened I was gasping for air and glared at her, "Are you okay your neck is red?" Hayes asked me, I looked up and went to get my inhaler, I ran to Cameron's room banging on the door, "What?" He asked I started having an asthma attack and he handed me my inhaler. "I thought you wanted to die." Chloe said peaking out the bathroom, "Shut up bitc*!" I snapped, I walked back to my hotel room and walked in.
"I have to go." She said, Hayes nodded and kissed her, "I love you." she said, "I love you." he smiled back and hugged her goodbye. "She's so nice." Hayes said I scoffed quietly and went on my phone texting my friends.
