I shook my head. "For what?! So you guys can make me part of your 'plans' again? So you guys could use me like some sort of pawn?! That was all I was to you guys, right?! I thought.... I honestly thought.....that you guys....could change if I tried understanding you. But.....I guess it's too late to change anything. I thought wrong about you guys. I got myself fooled. I was so....stupid..."




"No...No, you weren't just a pawn..." Luciano spoke in a low voice.



I clicked my tongue. "......I wasn't  just a pawn, but I still was. 'I could still be' is probably what you guys are thinking right now, too.... But I'll never be...I will never fall for anything you guys pull ever again. To think! To think that if I knew that you guys were just lying.....I could have......I could have...." I breathed heavily, partly from my mind spinning from all the anger and revelations.




"(Name)-chan...." Japan gently placed a hand on my shoulder, as if to calm me down.




I faced him and nodded, accepting his comfort. I paused for a while and continued what I was supposed to say, "........All this time.......I could've......gotten out of this mansion with the 1Ps sooner.... I could have ended this madness for them...and for myself...... All this time......I could have....... but I didn't........because I couldn't...... No.....



.....because I thought I couldn't."




"But it was for the best!" Luciano defended.




I stepped forward and glared at him. "NO. It was for your best!! For your best interests. For your benefit. For the best of your selfish needs!"




"(Second Name)*.....listen to me....." Luciano looked straight into my eyes, his magenta orbs piercing through mine.




My eyes widened in total shock. "How.....How did you know my second name...? Only a few people I know can call me that... I never even told you guys....."
