hearing footsteps come up the stares i groaned inwardly,"oh my god,you guys?what did you fill this room with?!"alex smiled goofily.,"Did you just spray perfume on every inch of the room."
my eye twitched in irritation as i looked at alex while saying,"far from it."alex laughed.mother shook her head and started to head out but alex called out
,"have you taken a closer look at her hair?"my shoulders slumped as i said,"please dont bring her back.."
despite my please she came back and looked at my hair,"yah that looks cool,but what i dont like about it is that when you do that her hair crisps up."
she left the room.sighing in relief silenetly so mother didnt hear i went back to writing my story.alex fell beside me.
,"what are you doing?"i asked not taking my eyes off of my computer as i continued typing.,"showing you the pictures i took.so as she showed me the pictures she took i started typing right after.
every now and then she would burst out singing randomly but at first it would start confident and then it would go down to a mumble
,"and my phones back at 20 percent again.."she said plainly.i smiled faintly as i continued to work on my story.i felt a knot in my hair and went to get it out but at forgot that alex put the spray in.
i cursed mentally checking my fingers hopping the spray didnt get on me again.i was way~ too lazy to get back up and do it again -_-..
