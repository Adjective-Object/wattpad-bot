Carmilla throws her phone across the room, running her hands through her hair. "What's wrong?" "Laura is pissed! She won't tell me where she is! And she told me to go fuck myself! I got carried away... and I think... I think I dumped her...." Ell is now intrigued. "Did you?" She sits down REALLY close to Carmilla. "Ell, could you like fuck off for a second please?" "Come on Carm, it's inevitable." She climbs onto Carmilla's lap, straddling. "Ell! GET THE FUCK OFF!" Carmilla is struggling but somehow Ell is a lot stronger. She leans down and captures Carmilla's lips. She stops fidgeting and melts into it. They don't even realize the door is opening. "I fucking knew it." Carmilla pushes Ell off her. "Laura I-" "Save it. You're a lying, cheating, manipulative sack of shit, Carmilla Karnstein." Before Carmilla could even take that in, Laura is gone.
