I fall back and push my clothes back into my bag, and take my knife from the ground.
"Please, please don't tell anyone what you saw, sir." I plead with him.
"Who was it? Who did you kill?" His deep, gravely voice asks me.
I remain silent and stare at my feet.
"Tell me." He demands. His voice is incredibly frightening.
"My.. My father." I whisper.
The man laughs, a crazy laughs. Then claps his hands. "You're evil."
"Wha-what? N-no! NO!" I shake my head. "He was evil! I did what I had to do to protect myself."
"Tell me dear," He walks closer. "Did you enjoy it? What you did?"
"Get away from me."
"Tell me!"
"Get away from me, you freak!" I yell.
He pauses, then jumps on me, throwing me to the ground. "What did you say to me?" He asks, pinning me down as I struggle. "I. Am. Beautiful." He says, extremely close to my face.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," I apologize. "I need to go! The police will be coming for me any moment now.."
"Say it! Say I'm beautiful!" He yells at me.
His eyes never close as I begin to realize his eyelids have been burned off.
"You're beautiful!" I tell him. He gets off of me and stands up. I grab my bag and try to walk off, but the man grabs my arm.
"Come with me."
"No! I don't know who you, you could be a murderer." I say, instantly regretting it.
"Oh there's no need to wonder," He says. "I am. And you are too."
I remain silent, ashamed of my new title. "Do you want to go to prison?"
I shake my head.
"Then come with me."
I hesitantly begin to follow him.
"What's your name?" He asks me.
I remain silent.
"This whole silent treatment shit is getting very old very quickly." He says with a bit of anger in his voice.
"Lena. My name is Lena." I answer quietly.
"Hello Lena, I'm Jeff." He introduces himself.
"So you kill people?" I ask him.
"Yes."
"People who have wronged you?" I ask.
"Sometimes. And sometimes just because I feel like it." He shrugs.
"So why not kill me?" I ask.
"Because I don't feel like it. I feel pity for you." He says, turning to me. "You're scared. You haven't embraced your gift quite yet, you see it as a curse, but I can help."
"I'm not pitiful." I cross my arms as we continue to walk.
"Ah but You are." He says.
We continue to walk in silence for the next 45 minutes until we get into a really shady neighborhood. Jeff comes to the side of a beaten up old building and unlocks the door to a cellar.
"Ladies first." He says, gesturing towards the entrance.
"I would rather not." I say shyly. Is he serious? He is basically asking me to commit suicide.
