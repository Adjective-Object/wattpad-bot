However, Brianna Didnt Seem To move An Inch..She Just Stared at Her Traumatized By Her Figure. How Could She When She Was Just Imagining It..Beneath Her eyes Lids..
She Couldnt Even See Herself..
Wind Blew Past The Women's Dress Softly, As She Stood Infront Of Her With Her Hand Still Reached Out To Her.
Tiny Whispers echoed In The Air Around Them..At First They Seemed Incoherent But The Whispers Grew louder And Louder Until Brianna Was Able To Hear Them..
'He Will Be Back..For You.'
Her Body Seemed To Over Heat And Cool At The Same Time. A Pressure Was Forcing Itself Beneath Her Eye Lids.
Her Eyes Started To Hurt And Before She Could Comprehend Anything, The Edges Of Her Vision Started Growing Darker And Darker, The Mysterious Woman Slowly Disapearing, Until Brianna Was Left In a Pitch Black.
However, It Was Not For Long As Her Eyes Flew Open Once Again Before A Loud Thud Rumbled and Brianna Was No Longer Standing But Instead, She Layed Limp On The Floor. She Slumped On The Floor, Hitting It Hard With Her Hip Before Her Head Followed Shortly After.
However, She Made No Noise, No Sound. She Didnt Scream Or Yelp For Help, Instead She Just Curled Herself Up In A Ball On The The Fluffy Black Carpet, Whimpering Painfully.
The Atmosphere changed Around her. There werent any Loud Music blast Through the mansion nor were There Any people Around her. She was No longer Celebrating her sixteenth birthday. Instead, She seemed to be In a Bedroom With Soft Black Carpet And Red/Black King-Sized bed.
The Room was Dark But the Dim Light of the Moon seeped through Her Curtains, creating a Faint Colour To the room.
She Has Had Enough Of Weeping, And Sobbing Through Out The Memory. Her Voice Was Hoarse And Husky, Her Eyes Were Red And Puffy, Her Nose Was A Big And Red And Her Hair Was Disheveled Mess.
Brianna's Point Of View..~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'
That's When Something Clicked.. I Really Lost Him. Forever. He's Not Coming Back. All Because Of me. I Was Selfish. SO Selfish That he Had To Protect me With His Life
As The Negative thoughts Started Roaming My Mind, Along With Other Flashbacks, My Breathing Suddenly Ragged And My Eyes Shut As My Lungs Burned For Oxygen.
I Couldnt Breath, And My Lungs Hurt Unbearably. I Let Out A Painful Scream, Clutching Onto my T-Shirt For Life.
Tears Rolled Down My cheeks In Never-Ending Waves As I Tried To Coquer The Pain.
I Was Having One Of My Anxiety Attacks Again.
And Thats Was Undoubtely The Worst.
I Screamed Again However, My Voice Was hoarse From All The Screaming And Crying. I Couldnt Take The Burning pain Any Longer.
The Ends Of My Vision Was getting Blurry And Stars Danced All Around Me. My hands Reached Up To My Throat And Started Clawing At It.
Suddenly The Door Burst Open, Crashing against The Marble Tiles Of The Semi-Dark Room Resulting In a Thunderous Thud.
The Sound Of Keys Clashing against The Cold Floors Before A Blurred Slihoutte Of A Dark Figure Approached Me In A Quick But careful Steps.
"NO !"
The Figure Fell Down On His Knees Beside Me With Loud Thud, Before I Felt Two Pair Of Rough And Calloused Hands Touch Me And My Upper Body Crashed Softly Against a Hard Chest.
