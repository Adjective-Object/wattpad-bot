~(FLAWLESS)~LET ME JUST TAKE A MINUTE! 274K HOLY FUCKING SHIT GUYS I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!
Shea's P.O.V
Seth stopped and looked me dead in the eyes. "Shea what the hell are those!" He says angrily looking at my wrists. I wince as he grabs them and his face softens. "F-Fuck Shea im sorry.." He whispers to me. I pull my arms away and sit up and cross my arms against my chest, my eyes filling with tears. "Baby.. Baby no... Shhh shhh im sorry..." Seth whispers to me, pulling me into his lap. His body so warm against mine, relaxing me. I rest my head softly on his chest as my phone starts to buz. I look over and see Caspers name and picture pop up on my screen.
"S-Seth.. Caspers calling..." I say grabbing the phone and handing it to him.
"Answer it.." He whispers to me.. and I look at him worriedly.
"I-I cant.."
"Yes you can Shea..." He whispers. I nod and swipe the screen answering the call. I slowly bring my phone up to my ear and listen.
"Ahhhh look who answered" Casper says coldly into the phone, following an evil laugh. "Listen, ends up me and Ashley are out of jail. Dont ask how, personal business, but we'd love to make a visit and solve some things we didn't get to finish.." I let my eyes shut and a single tear falls down my face. Seth watches me intently.
"Casper, why are you doing this..?" I talk softly, trying to stay calm, a tear falling down my cheek again. Seth wipes it and looks in my eyes.
"Because I want you. I want you and only you Shea darling and Im going to get what I want. No cops or Seth or you are going to stop me from doing that." Most girls might feel flattered by this, but after everything all it did was make me sick.
"I dont want you Casper.." I whisper to him.
"Im going to make you want me Shea! Watch your back and If i were you, id have Seth watch out too" and then a click, the phone call had ended.
"Seth we need to leave and we need to fucking leave now." I say to him grabbing his hand. I pull him into my closet and grab my suitcases. "Go pack clothes now!"
Im softly then pushed against my closet wall, Seths lips pressing against mine. On instinct my body relaxes and I melt against his lips. "Shea.. Relax and tell me whats going on and what he said.." He whispers against my lips.
"Hes coming for us.. Hes not gonna stop Seth.. We need to leave.. Please.. Just.. We need to get out of here..." I say to him, my eyes filled with fear, and filling up with tears.
"Okay..." He whispers and takes a deep breath. He looks in my eyes. "We dont have money Shea" He says softly.
I pull away from him and walk back in more of my closet, I pull out a big sized box and walk into my bedroom.
"When my dad died he left me a bunch of money..." I say as I open it up, feeling Seth's presence right behind me. "750 grand in cash is right here, I was going to save it for college but I think this is more important..." I say softly to Seth. "It covers clothes, food, a place to stay, especially gas money. We can go somewhere far and just get jobs and live as on our own... We wont need anybody else."
"What about Lisa, Shea? Your mom? My dad?"
"Would you rather be dead!? Cause thats how we're both gonna end up Seth! Just go pack your things! Please!" I beg him.
"Okay.." He whispers "But we have to leave a note for all of them..." He pauses. "And explain absolutely everything, even us."
"As long as we're gonna be okay..." I say softly
"I wont let anyone hurt you Shea. I love you and im not gonna let you do this on your own, theres no way." He says softly at the door way.
I smile and look at him. "Go pack your things. Be quick okay? And I love you too"
