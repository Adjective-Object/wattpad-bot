He apologized didn't he?
Yeah so one appology isn't going to change how I feel. I can't forget what he called me. This is his fault.
I watched as he ran out of the school. Great. Just fucking great.
"Casper i'm going to go home. I don't feel well" I said after a couple minutes of walking through the halls.
"But its your first day" He said squeezing my hand a little tighter.
"I know but I'll have plenty more days of this. I'm just going to go." I said pulling his hand away from mine.
"Okay babe. I'll call you tonight" He kissed me softly once more before just leaving me in the middle of the hallway. I could feel the tears building up in my eyes. Im so stupid.
I ran to the girls bathroom and locked myself in a stall letting the tears fall heavily down my cheeks. Im so fucking stupid. If I had my car I could go see my dad but no I just had to ride with Seth.
After a good 15 minutes I made my way out of the bathroom and walked through the empty hallways and walked out the front of the school. I looked around and saw that Seths car was gone.
Great
I started walking home. One foot after the other. I walked and thought. Thought about how stupid I am for doing this.
I am with a guy I hate
I made the guy I think I love cry
The guy I might love thinks i'm a slut
I'm walking home and its going to rain
Im just stupid
So so stupid
As I walked I could feel the rain start up. Drop after drop soaking my hair and clothes. I just kept walking I didn't care at this point.
Why did I do this to Seth? Oh yeah I know because im a slut. Just like he wants me to be.
My stomach was churning. I was discusted with myself. Expecially after kissing Casper.
I need to apologize to Seth. I need to fix things with him.

As I reached the house I was soaked. Seths car was in the driveway and I was ready to talk to him. I thought about what I was going to say to him. How I was going to approach him.
Everything
As I entered the house. I noticed Seths shirt on the ground. Wtf?
"Seth?" I said looking around the house. More peicing of his clothing all over the house. Along with others... Oh my gosh. He.. He
I stormed up to his room and I could hear it going on. I was pissed. I barged into his room and he stopped looked over at me and the girl screamed.
"SETH WHAT THE FUCK!?" He looked down at the girl and she looked over at me confused and angry.
"Who the fuck are you?" She asked me
"No what I want to know who you are?"
"Its non of your buisness now get out"
"No" I said trying to hold back my tears. I looked over at Seth and a tear fell down my face.
"YOU FUCKING BASTARD!" I yelled running at him. He stood up and tried explaining but this was it. I was beyond ready to talk to him.
