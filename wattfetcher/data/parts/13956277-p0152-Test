"So, you're still not going to get me a milkshake?" He put the puppy face on, "Fine" I said.

Next day, me and Simon were roaming the whole city sticking posters on buildings, elevators, electricity poles and empty walls. The day after it was Saturday so we headed to the malls at 8, women showed support more than men, because men are tough and not emotional, but that's not how men should be, men should be helpful to others and stand by those who need help.
Two days later, the hashtag #Savethegirls started trending along with the website we made, even those who didn't know the story shared the hashtag to get to know the truth.
.....
"WHAT !" I woke up because my phone was ringing, I checked it and it was Molly, "Sorry to wake you up so early" I checked the clock and it was 5:09 am, "Oh really ? What can I do with your apologize now? What do you want?" I become a very grumpy person if you wake me up early, "Come to my house immediately, there's something you need to see" I sighed, "It better be something important" I hung up and dressed then sneaked out the house without waking Karam up.
"What's going on?" I asked Molly, "Take a look" Simon gave me his laptop, his twitter account was opened, "Cool, you got 3 million followers, I got 5,2 million because of the story we are spreading. IS THAT WHAT YOU WOKE ME UP FOR?" I shouted, "Shut up ! Mom is sleeping. Check the last message I received" He said.
"Cut this bull**** and stop doing what you are doing if you want to live, tell your girl to do the same. You got no idea about what we can do to shut you up" The message said.
"We knew that this was coming soon or later, so it's not a surprise" I said, Simon remained silent, "Look at me, we are not going to let this stupid threat stop us. We started this and we have to finish it, I warned you before and but you insisted, see this girl *points at Nina's sister* I promised her sister that I will save her, and I never break my promises" I said sharply.
"Now, the fun and danger begins. Molly, make us some pancakes, we need to eat before we leave. We still got some posters, right Leena ?" Simon smirked.
