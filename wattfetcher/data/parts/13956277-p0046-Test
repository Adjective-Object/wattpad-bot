"Not here, not now, not my car" Damon jumped in the driver's seat .
"Yes, here, now, your car"
"Can you drive ?" he asked in fear.
"Oh please, better than you" I chuckled.
"Show me what you got. Ps: If you crash my dear expensive Range Rover, I'll throw you over a cliff" He smiled.
"Okay, get off" He jumped from the driver's seat.
"Sit in the back seat, Elina will be beside me"
"oh now I won't ! first, you steal my car, and now you want me to sit in the back" He shouted.
"Calm down, The car already has an assurance" Elina said.
"shut up" Damon glared at her.
"Get in the back seat, Damon"
"Ok fine" He sighed in frustration.
"put your seatbelts on, the ride is about to start"
"Can I tell my parents that I love them first ?" Damon asked dramatically.
"You'll tell them when you get back in one piece" I gave him an evil look then I caught the steering.
"Let's go" I stepped as hard as I could on the gass.
"YOU PSYCHO SLOW THE F*** DOWN" Damon cursed
"Did I just hear a curse" I sped more.
"YOU FREAKY DRIVER ARE GONNA GET US KILLED" He shouted  in fear and anger.
"I didn't hear an apology yet" I teased, Elina laughed, apparently, She likes speed.
"SORRY. IM SO FREAKING SORRY JUST STOP" And I pushed the breaks while turning the wheels sharply.
"Perfect parking" I jumped out of the car with Elina while Damon was still shocked.
"I have never seen someone drive so crazy fast and park so perfectly" He was still staring at the front glass with his widened eyes.
"Come on I need to fix my hijab before the interview" I opened the door for him.
"I-am-NOT going to let you drive my car again" He snapped his keys from my hand.
"Admit it, I drive better than you" I smirked.
"You almost killed us"
"Don't argue, we need to get to the shop" Elina said and we nodded.
.......
"Hey, I see that you need some employees" I smiled at who seemed responsible for the place. she was all in pink
"Oh yeah, but you're too young. Can you tide clothes in a good way ?" She asked me.
"I believe I can, but I'll do better as an accountant, I'm good in math" I smiled at her.
"Okay, but we will Test you first" She smiled.
"I'm ready"
"Stand behind the long table and let's see how you can manage these costomers"
"Okay"
"But we didn't buy calculators yet" She gave me an evil look.
"I'll get use of my brain, a pen and a paper will be perfect" She gave me what I asked for then I headed to calculate what the costemers need to pay.
"Hey" An old woman put almost 50 pieces of clothes in front of me, I saw the pinky woman looking at me with evil pitty in her eyes (evil pitty, just imagine it).
