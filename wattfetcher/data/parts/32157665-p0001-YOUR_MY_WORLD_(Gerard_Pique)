Lucy's POV ~
Beep Beep goes the sound of my phone alarm going off , i suppose i cant complain seen as i actually enjoy where i go to school is at the stoke academy , where i played for the girls team , yes i loved football becuase my dad was Geoff Cameron , even though i was not close with him due to the fact im actually with a different family becuase my dad had given me up when i was younger and i didnt know why i just hoped that one day i would meet him again and he could tell me, you woud think that he wouldnt feel so far away while being so close , so basically my only friends were really boys , but my best friend liam was amazing we hung around like all the time , we would go to watch stoke games on the weekend , just watching my dad playing was amazing ,and it looks like my dads best friend called Bojan Krkic was so adorable it was unreal , i had a bit of a thing for him he was only 19 and i was 17 but trust me there was no chance i would be meeting him soon. I find it hard to make new friends due to being given up so early and not having a reason , so i became a problem child while attentding public school and only found that when i was at football training that i would be sturdy , so i was transfered fully to the academy , which i loved and i have been there for 3 years now , i met some great people , however still never managed to bump into my dad unfortunatley.
Geoff's POV ~
It was training day at stoke for the FA cup final in a week at Wembley and we were told to have a break , seen as we had been working hard on our routines for weeks. I decided to go off with Bojan to look at the academy , to look at the improvements they had made , while we were walking over to the building somethimg caught my eye , it was the girls football team , one girl stood out to me , she looked like me , she did the same thing when she scored. I thought to myself thats it , it must be my daughter , omg . I grabbed Bojan and ran over to the field where they were playing , lucky for me they had just gone on half time , i shouted Lucy and she turned around to see me and , her eyes lit up. She proceeded to run over to me and jumped and i craddled her into a bear hug , it felt so good to be reunited with her.
Bojan's POV ~
Geoff had finally found his daughter that he wanted to be with for so long and tell her why she was given up , but when i saw her run into his arms , i couldnt help but stare at her she was so beautiful , she had long blonde hair , brown eyes , cute smile , adorable laugh i couldnt help but smile at her. I think she took my breath away or even more my heart , i stood in a daydream for a minute or two until i was shaken softly by her sweet,small hands saying Bojan back to earth as she laughed so cutely. She hugged me and said nice to meet you i embraced it for a while , i couldnt ask her anything yet not until her and her dad sorted things out and even then Geoff would go mad at me if i did date his daughter , but anyway what am i saying i wont date her she is too perfect for me *sigh*

Hope you enjoyed it so far please vote , Lucy xxx :)
