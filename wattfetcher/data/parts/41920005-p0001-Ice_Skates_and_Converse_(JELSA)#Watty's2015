Elsa tied her platinum blonde hair into her usual french braid. She look at the mirror and fixed her sea foam green colored backless dress. She wore a special bracelet that her mother gave her. A matching one with her sister and her mother. She smiled as she remembered her singing voice. She looked over the piles and boxes that laid in the corner of her room. Basically, all of them contained high heels that she loves to  wear. But, she chose to wear her white high tops converse. She tied the shoelaces gracefully, opened her door and embraced the party going on.

Jack lazily got out of bed after the 10th time of snoozing his phone. He stood up and stretched. Emma, his sister, screamed his name over and over again. Emma, kept shouting for him to wake up because she needed a ride to go to her best friend's birthday party. He shouted back, "Okay!" Jack got dressed and yawned as he put on a white shirt and a black leather jacket, he tied on his converse and went downstairs, grabbed his key and embraced his sister's endless screams.
