I turn at Cameron and he throws me his keys and I do a quick back handspring then catch them. A couple of boys were watching me, one of them winked at me and I walked away to the car like a boss.
I plug up my phone and start to play SoMo, Back to the start, plays and I start singing it, the guys soon get in and Cameron drives away. Cameron looks at his phone then gets mad, "Are you okay?" I ask him, "Im fine!" He yells, I sit back feeling embarrassed so I just look down. "Why are you asking me this? I just really want to know why you told me to leave when he started hurting you?" He snapped.
I smack my forehead, "Cameron, he told me he wanted to kill you-" he cuts me off, "Why didn't you let him?" He asked, "CAMERON! You are the basically the only sibling I have now, Sierra doesn't call anymore, Conner is dead, Do I have to repeat myself because I don't want to anymore. I can't believe you would ask that." I snapped.
He sat back in his seat, I lay in Hayes's lap and Put my legs on Riley. "I'm sorry." Cameron said, I look at him he had tears in his eyes, I think of the days we would always laugh together and prank Sierra and Conner. "Its fine, I deserved it." I said, he shook his head, "No...You don't. I don't want to ruin your fun." he said, Riley sends me a funny video to cheer me up and of course it helps.
"This is why you're my best friend." I chuckled, Hayes turned my head kissing me, "And I love your unexpected kisses." I smile then continue to kiss him.
