I'm not that surprise it got out. Now I did thought it would last like two or three more chapters but I can understand why. It isn't one of the best songs in the fandom so I can see why it was the next one to go. Anyway if you voted the song out you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started
And the nominees are:
SMILE SONG
BBBFF
MORNING IN PONYVILLE
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
LIFE IN EQUESTRIA
PINKIE'S LAMET
MAKE A WISH
MUSIC IN THE TREETOPS
A FRIEND FOR LIFE
Good luck to the nominees!
