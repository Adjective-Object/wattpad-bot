"ARE YOU CRAZY !! THE PERFUME COSTS MORE THAN 300 DOLLARS AND THE BOX IS NOT LESS THAN 50 DOLLARS" She screamed at me.
"I don't and won't take any gift from a freaky secret admirer" I said confidently.
"You're stupid" She continued drinking her cup. I looked at the clock on my phone, 6:30.
"I'm sorry but my break is over I need to go back to work" We said our goodbyes and I went back to my regular place behind the counter and to my grumpy boss, I believe that she's grumpier than the famous grumpy cat.
"90 Dollars please, is this your daughter" I smiled at the little girl in front of me.
"Yes, her name is Daisy" The little girl blushed and grabbed her mother's leg.
"Awwh, such a beautiful name. I think I have something in my pocket" The girl let go of her mother's leg and smiled at me while she was watching me curiously looking in my pockets.
"Uh ! I found it" I pulled a big strawberry lollipop, her smile grew bigger and she started to jump enthusiastically.
"Her you go Daisy" I gave it to her.
"oh, that was nice of you" The mother smiled at me " Daisy, what do we say when someone does something nice to us ??" The mother lift Daisy.
"Thank you" The girl leaned forward and kissed my cheek.
"Awwh, you're welcome Daisy" They left.
In case you were wondering why a 17 year old teenager has lollipops in her pocket ... Well, my grumpy boss gave it to me because I came early today and patted my head.
-Secret Admirer ...
The words kept playing inside my head.
Who is he ?
How did he know that I work here ?
How could he sneak to the employees' room ?
How did he recognize my clothes and put the box between them ?
But I put all these questions aside and concentrated on my job.
......
"Damon, who do you think you are to follow me and put some stupid expensive gift between my clothes" I raised an eyebrow at the boy lying on the couch.
"What ?" He muted the TV.
"I don't need any stupid expensive gift to fall in love for you ! I hate you Okay ? You don't need to spend money on me because I'm not the kind of girls who follow the cash" He lied there with his jaw on the floor.
"Damon was here all day" Mrs.Carter said.
"What the hell are you talking about" He looked amazed.
"I'm talking about the 300 dollars worth perfume you put between my clothes with a paper that says Secret admirer" I threw my bag furiously.
"Damon has been on the couch all day, I swear" Elina said.
"I won't buy you a 300 dollars worth gift, even if you were my mother" Damon's mother coughed and he mouthed a 'sorry' to her.
"Then who is it if it wasn't you ? nobody else knows that I Work in stylish & modestÂ  except you, Elina, Mrs.Carter and Helen because she came across the store" I said.
"I honestly don't know, I didn't tell anybody" Damon changed the channel.
"Neither did I" Mrs.Carter and Elina said in sync
