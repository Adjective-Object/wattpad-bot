Badgerstar frowned and hesitated for a moment before giving the final answer. "You may, if you have Wolfstar's permission."
"Yes of course!" Swiftstorm let out a grin. He looked overjoyed to see his kits. "I promise she did. Now let's go!! I want to see her or him..."
Badgerstar rolled his eyes at his childish behavior. "Alright, alright, and it's a she-kit" Badgerstar grumbled as he picked up the mice that Swiftstorm caught and walked back to camp.
On the way, he made Swiftstorm help carry feathers back to camp as he caught another piece of prey. He watched the former deputy with excitement filling his green eyes. Badgerstar could still remember that feeling when Goldenwings gave birth to Morningwish, and Midnightkit. It was the best feeling in the world, for Badgerstar at least.
