My phone buzzes in my bag. I grit my teeth and ignore it. It buzzes again. And again. Mr Wayne stops talking and looks at me. "I'm sorry, do you need a minute to answer that?" Mr Wayne ask sarcastically.I shake my head."Phones turned off Miss Jackson" He says in a monotone voice. All eyes are on me. I feel my cheeks blush, I hate being the centre of attention. I dig through my bag and pull out my phone. I don't check who is texting me, I just turn it off and shove it back into my bag. After forever, Mr Wayne continues with the lesson. I try to sit and listen through the rest of class with out any more mishaps. Everyone is unusually quite. The awkwardness is so intense. The bell rings, thank god.

I nibble at a peanut butter sandwich while my best friend Katie jabbers on about a cute dress she saw at the mall. Typical Katie, always shopping and keeping up with the latest trends in fashion. I look at her, wavy golden hair flows down her back. Dazzling blue eyes. Perfectly shaped face with naturally cherry red lips. Gorgeous. Then I look at myself. Straight chocolate brown hair, and brown eyes. Thin pale lips. Freckles dot my face. Ordinary. What I would give to look like Katie. What I would give to be extraordinary.
(Stay tuned for next chapter, sorry if I might be a bit slow, I am currently working on 4 different books. Feel free to comment and share your thoughts) ðŸ˜Š
