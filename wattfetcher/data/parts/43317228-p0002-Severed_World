His storey made tears stream down my face, he looked at me shocked.
"My brother, he was my first. I shot him in the head with my dads gun, and the thing you said about never seeing the world the same, its not that you see it differently its that it changed to quickly for you to adapt, but who could ever get use to living like this its kinda like....A trend, one minute evreyones whering bell bottoms and the next skinny jeans, the truth, were still where bell bottoms in a skinny jean world"I said as tears fell silently. He looked at me shocked at my words. He scooted closer to me.
"Aria, your not at all like I expected"
"You either James, your way more cliche"I said breaking the momment.
"Night" I said changing my mood instantly and turning away.
I was laying there awake when I heard him say somthing.
"You dont half to hide, theres no point in the world we live in"
"What makes you think im not being me"
"Because you hate that you care, you hate that you cry over stuff so simple as somones storey, your scared that if your not tough, you'll drown in the knew world" he said. He was exactly right, but I could not let him know. I sat up for a momment and looked at him.
"Dont act like you know me, we just me" I said angrily.
"Ok then tell me about your self so I can judge you" he said making me smile a bit. He noticed and smiled at me. We spent the whole night talking and geting to know one another.
Friendship is all we have left.
