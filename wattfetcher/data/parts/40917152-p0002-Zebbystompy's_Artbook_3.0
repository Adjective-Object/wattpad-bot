Okay, So I am having a contest with cats. I am looking for my warriors, Leopardleaf or Moonstar.
Leopardleaf (preferred):Light gray tom with dark gray spots and inside the spots its white. He has blue eyes and is VERY fluffy.
Moonstar:Moonstar is also light gray  with blue eyes, but she has white stripes, paws, chin (Not muzzle just bottom part.), tail-tip, and behind ears. She is also very fluffy.
(Leopardleaf is like a male version of Moonstar kinda I guess...just with leopard spots...well not really xD)
Prizes:1st Place- TWO sets of Digital Art, your choice on appearance and species. (Cat, Dog, Bear or Human)
2nd Place- ONE set of Digital Art, your choice on appearance and species. (Cat, Dog, Bear or human)
3rd Place- ONE set of Digital Art, cat. Your choice on appearance.
(Prizes will be made around June 30-July 30, probably released July 16?)
This contest ends July 15!
