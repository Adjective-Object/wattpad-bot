Its not easy so, you take it slow
You're coming up, youre coming around the bend
You're my good friend,
Best friend
And you're coming up, you're coming around the bend
Ha ha, haaa.....

You're making friends with the fireflies,
I can't say that that comes as a surprise,
But the things they say are not what they seem,
So you've been called to tell us what they mean,
Yes, you've been called to tell us what they mean

It's a plot though,
I told you so,
Im wising up, im wising up to them,
They seem like good friends, best friends,
and I'm wising up, I'm wising up to them
Ha ha, haaa.....

You're making friends with the fireflies,
You know when they die their light stays alive,
But the things they say are not what they seem,
So you've been called to tell us what they mean,
Yes, you've been called to tell us what they mean

You're making friends with the fireflies,
I can't say that that comes as a surprise,
But the things they say are not what they seem,
So you've been called to tell us what they mean,
Yes, you've been called to tell us what they mean
Yes, you've been called to tell us what they mean!
Yes, you've been called to tell us what they mean
