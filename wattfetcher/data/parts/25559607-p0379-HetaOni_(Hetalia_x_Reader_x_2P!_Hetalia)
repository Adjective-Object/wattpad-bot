Luciano knew that he couldn't get away from this situation. He knew it couldn't continue like this, either.


What was he supposed to do?


"Tell them what they want to know, of course." he thought to himself sarcastically. He knew that. He knew that's what he was supposed to do...but he didn't know if was something he could do.



"How can you think that you couldn't do something if you haven't even tried doing it? If you think you can't, I'll still be here believing that you could.

The sky isn't the limit, you are." a familiar voice echoed in his mind.


Why did he have to remember that of all times?


Sighing, Luciano cleared his throat and looked at all his comrades.


"You want an explanation, right?" he asked.


They nodded quietly, their gazes unfaltering.



Kuro looked at him and spoke, "What do you exactly mean by this not being our first timeloop? We all know that we've been following those First Players through the loops together."


"That's what you know, but just because that's how you remember it, it doesn't mean that that's everything to it." Luciano replied, blankly looking down on the floor.


Andres stepped forward and spoke, which was a rare event. "You mean...our situation...is just like that of those First Players?"


"Not exactly, but it is similar." Luciano answered. He looked up and observed his comrades. "Are you all sure that you want me to tell you what actually happened?" he asked.


Crossing his arms, Matthieu lowered his sunglasses and spoke, "Of course, we do. We've been waiting for you to tell us that shit."


Sighing, Luciano slumped on a chair and looked up at the ceiling. He was silent for a while, but then spoke,


"I'm not going to go in full detail on this. It's not like I actually can. It's...been such a long time already. I'm not skilled in explaining things like these, either. Just make do with what you can comprehend from the things I can recall."
