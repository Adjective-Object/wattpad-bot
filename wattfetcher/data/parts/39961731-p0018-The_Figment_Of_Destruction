"Nothing, Mom. I'm okay." I assured her.
"Then who are you talking to?" She continued to question.
"Um... To God?" I lied.
"Haha. I know you're lying. I'm coming in." Mom responded.
"No!" I yelled, but she was already in my room. But then I realized that Amy didn't vanish.
"Hello, sweetie." Mom softly said as she hugged me.
What am I supposed to do now? I thought to myself. Why did I have to see this ghost? Ugh, it would've been better for me to think I was mad instead of meeting a figure made out of thin light.
"Hi, Mom." I nervously replied while wrapping my arms around her. Once she let go of me, she put her hands on my shoulders.
"Are you ok?" She asked me.
"Yeah. I'm alright." I answered her.
"Okay."
"Mom?"
"Yes?"
"Can you see that?" I asked her, pointing to Amy. Her expression was blank.
"See what?"
"You don't see any figure?"
"What figure? I just see a green wall. Charlotte, are you sure you're okay?"
"Uh... Of course, you don't see anything there and I am okay. I was just... talking about... God. No one can see him, right?"
"Right?"
"Exactly. See? I was talking to god. Can't I talk to him once in a while?"
"Of course, you can."
"See? Now, you must go away. God and I have some personal business to cover." I said as I pushed Mom out of the room and shut the door. I turned around and found Amy "sitting" on my bed.
"So... How did you become a ghost?" I asked.
"Ugh. Humans." Amy said under her breath, thinking I didn't hear her, but I did. "Isn't it obvious? I died."
"Duh!" I yelled, already annoyed somehow. "I meant how did you die?"
"Well, I died two years ago when I was 18. My asshole father was a drunk mad man. He practically hated me and my family. So instead of just leaving us, he just got drunk and high, still being the asshole he was, all the time. We kept on complaining about it and tried forcing him into rehab, but he wouldn't go. It kept on happening for about two years until he got tired of everything, So, while he was drunk, he decided to try to kill us. He put the whole house on fire while we were inside of it. My family and I burned and died, and luckily, he died with us as well. So, my father, mother, little brother, baby sister, and I are ghosts." Amy explained.
"Wow.. That's harsh.. Sorry.."
"Don't worry about it. Pretty sure I'm in a better place now."
"Yeah. Anyway, why were you messing with me in the living room?"
"Oh. I was bored and wanted to mess with a human. Usually, I'm not seen afterwards, but you're something else."
"Really? Last time I checked, I wasn't an alien."
"No. Not like that. I mean you're not like other humans. I think you have a gift."
"I have a gift? Haha! Puh-lease. The only gift I have is to fail in life."
"That's funny, but not what I mean. I think you can see the dead."
