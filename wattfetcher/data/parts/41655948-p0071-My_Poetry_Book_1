Insanity consumed me
And I didn't care about my lyrics,
My lines,
My dreams,
Anything.
My worst nightmare came alive.
The cold tide was pulling me under
And nobody could help.
I was destined for disaster,
Self destructive.
I don't know how
But you saved me then.
I owe you everything in the world.
You stopped the static in the air,
The breaking of my heart,
And the voices in my head.
Thank you.
