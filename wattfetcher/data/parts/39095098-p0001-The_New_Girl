Well let me first start you off, my name is Morgan Leigh-Ann Gold. I'm not very exciting, just plain, boring me. Today's the day that I, Morgan must move from America to Australia. I bet you you're wondering why I wouldn't want to move to Australia, lets get this straight, I hate people and people hate me. I'm pathetic, useless, I'm nothing. I have acquired one friend over the past 16 years of my life. ONE FRIEND! That's how much people hate me, they don't even want to get to know me, they know nothing. I mean I guess it's alright considering I'm finally moving away from my mother. Now only my dad's left. But today satan himself told me that we are moving to Australia. I'm soooo excited! Did you see that I'm being sarcastic, I'm not excited more like the opposite. I'm dreading to go to Australia. So now I have to pack, terrific! I'm so la- "Morgan get your lazy ass up and start packing!", And that my friends was satan in the flesh. Aka my father, woohooo.
"I'm packing! Gosh, there's this thing called patience, and it would do the world some good if you had any!"
"Morgan Leigh-Ann you do not talk to me like that!"
"Well maybe I should start, it seems as if you think you own the world! And that they should be bowing to your feet!"
"I wouldn't have to act like that if you only would listen to me.", my father said in a some-what calming voice.
"Sorry." I said
And just like that I went to packing my bags. **********I really suck at writing, but I hope y'all enjoyed this.-Jamie
