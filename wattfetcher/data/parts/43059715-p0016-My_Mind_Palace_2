1. Two wrongs don't make a right.
2. Wattpad isn't for selfies or dating. Go to Instagram if you want that.
3. Posting things about your so called 'depression' is pitiful. So many people think they have it bad, but they're really spoiled and have everything that someone who has real depression wants.
4. I hate it when people post selfies for pity and say 'I'm so ugly'.
5. There are so many hypocrites that think they are always right that it caused me to have a mindfuck.
6. Get out if you land among any of these.
