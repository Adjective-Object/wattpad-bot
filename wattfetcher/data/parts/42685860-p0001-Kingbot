"Thomas!!!". I heard my wake up call from outside my tent. I forced my eyes open and squinted at my clock: three minutes past six.
"Thomas you have five minutes to wash yourself and get in uniform, chop chop!!"
"Yes, sir", I mumbled trying to sound awake.I shuffled out of my sleeping bag and used my weak, morning muscles to stand up. My arms and legs screamed, aching for ten more minutes in bed but I stretched them out, making my body as long as possible.
My legs somehow managed to carry me to the bathrooms and then back to my tent. Three other boys shared the space with me: Harvey, Theo and my good mate Jack.
"You alright?", Jack muttered, trying to hold back a yawn"Not really", I answered back, "Today is Slop day, gonna be tough!".Slop day is when all troops come together to walk a 30 mile patrol, we call it "Slop" day because everyone is so tired and we literally have to be dragged along by our leaders. Why are we doing it? Well, we are looking for Kingbots, the things that started the war in 2068...
