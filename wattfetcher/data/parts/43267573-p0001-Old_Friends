It was a little past midnight and I was blasting Metallica through my headphones once my sister came in my room and through a book at me, a dictionary. There was a note attached to it said look up the word sleep cause I'm trying to get some! Turn down your dumb music...!
So I took out one headphone and said "leave me alone I'm using my headphones""That doesn't mean  ican't hear your scream-o music" I reply"That doesn't men I care" I answer with putting back in my headphone and start abnoxiously singing to it. Just then she took my phone and through it across the room and it shattered."Oh your gonna pay for that!" I yell charging at her but she runs out the back door and banging into the new neighbor's door and a minute later I have her locked on the ground and I'm beating her up. Then the neighbor door opens and a girl about my age is breaking us up. Once I get a good look at her I remember her "Kamdel?" I say
Flashback
"Yo Sky!" Kamdel my best friend and my crush yells for me"Hey Kam I was thinking we could hang out this weekend and go see that new horror movie Poltergeist" I say back"Yeah and we can do this now" she says and leans into kiss me and I let her. "Kamdel you like me too?" I ask curiously"Totally" she says then breaks out laughing and then everyone else in the hall is laughing with her."What's going on?" I say as I begin to cry"It was a dare. I don't like you like that. And I don't want to be your friend. Ha. Your gay! I don't wanna be friends with a gay person! Haha especially because you obviously like me more than I like you" she says pulling out her phone to take pictures of my red puffy face from crying. Which I still was doing. I run out of the school to call my mom and tell her to pick me up and then I tell her everything. And because my family reputation which was perfect we had to move so it couldn't really get out bad enough to ruin it. Because my parents can't have a gay daughter. I never thought I could disappoint someone by being me...
