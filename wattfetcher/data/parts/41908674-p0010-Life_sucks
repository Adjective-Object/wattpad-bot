Rosa pov.today during maths Mr Monkey came in and gave me letter saying it was from Christina.
THE LETTER:Dear Rosa,I am so sorry for bullying you. Also I am sorry for trying to kill you yesterday. I'm glad to here that you are ok and that you and James go out. I made A Huuugggeee mistake. I was stupid and i wasn't thinking. I was jealousÂ  and that sort of stuff. Also I know you cut when you're depressed. I hope you haven't done that yet but if you have, i am really sorry. I was jealous because you are so pretty and you can be yoursellf and you are kind hearted, sweet, lovely, can handle all the shit people through at you until you are with the people you trust. that's why i was jealous you are all of that and i,m not (apart from pretty.). I love you i hope you forgive me. but i understand if you don't. Why would you want to be friends with someone who backstabs you.love from christina. P. S: I hope that I can hang with you sometime soon.
I was touched. But I still wasn't ready to forgive her yet. Plus I'm hanging with James after school anyway.

At lunch I showed James and that the letter and my arm. Before they could say anything Christina walked in.When she saw my arm, her eyes widen and gasped. "Omg Rosa! I am so sorry!" Cryed Christina. "You betta be you spoil little bit-!" Growlled James. "James no. Please." I whispered. Christina spoke again. "I-I am such a fool. I hurt my best fr-" she was cut off by a huge KA-BOOM! Down the corridor. We all sprinted to see what it was.
