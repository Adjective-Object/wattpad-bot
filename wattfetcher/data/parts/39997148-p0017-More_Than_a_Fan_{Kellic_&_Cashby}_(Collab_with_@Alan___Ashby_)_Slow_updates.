"So what?" He asked and I leaned back in my seat watching the two amused. Yeah, Kellin is definitely not an ax murderer.
"So I'm not gonna freak out or whatever. I'm taking pictures for a few bands I enjoy but I'm not gonna freak over them."
"We'll see," He said and turned back to me. "I promise I'm not some psycho fan or whatever I'm just really excited."
"We'll see? What's the meant to mean?"
"Well I'm glad you're excited." I told him.
"Don't worry about it Al," He said. "So, I'm staying in the bus you say?"
"This is what I get for making friends."
"Yeah you'll be staying with us."
"Awesome!" He said.
"If you want we can go back to the buses and I can show you your bunk." I offered taking a drink from my water.
"That would be cool."
"Awesome, let's go then." I said.
"I'll catch you guys later. I have to make a call." Alan said standing up.
"Alright well we'll see you later then," I told him and led Kellin out of the restaurant.  The walk back to the bus was quick and Kellin made sure that it wasn't quiet whatsoever. It was actually really cute watching him blabber on and on about nothing in particular but I already knew I couldn't think about him like that. Besides, he's just a fan and now our merch manager.
Nothing more.
No matter how cute his blabbering was.
I opened the door to see the three screaming at the television playing video games.
Of course.
"You cheated! You dick!" Jaime yelled pushing Mike off the couch.
"Ow!" He whined and I rolled my eyes.
"What is with you people pushing each other off the couch?" I demanded as Kellin and I walked in.
"Its quick and effective." He said just as Tony pushed him off.
"He's right."
"Can you act civil for a little while or something? Guys this is Kellin our new merch manager."
Kellin smiled and waved at them all excitedly, "Hi!"
"Hi." They said together.
"I'm just going to show him to his bunk alright?" I said to all of them.
"Yeah, yeah."
I sighed, "Follow me then."

Austin's Pov

I laid in my bunk with my blanket over my head refusing to get up. It was so loud out there and my head was absolutely killing me.
"Austin! We have sound check in ten minutes you better get up!" Aaron shouted.
I groaned but threw the blankets off of me anyways, "Fine."
"Up, up, up all the other guys have left because no one is waiting on you." He said ripping the curtain back from my bunk, "We can't be late."
"Fine I'm coming." I mumbled and got out of the bunk.
"Good. I'm leaving and see you inside."
"Yeah I'll see you then," I told him as he walked out of the bus.
