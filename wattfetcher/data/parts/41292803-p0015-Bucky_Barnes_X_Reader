I was in a white room. No windows. I couldn't move my head more then a few inches. I saw blinking lights and beeping machines. Suddenly, one of the machines began beeping and blinking. Doctors and nurses rushed in and began talking, but I couldn't hear. I was immerged in black.

AN: sorry its so short. Will write later. Thanks so much!
