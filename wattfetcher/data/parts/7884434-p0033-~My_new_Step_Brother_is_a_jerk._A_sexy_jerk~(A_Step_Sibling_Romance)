Wow guys you have no fucking idea how sorry I am... My parents grounded me and I have been grounded since like the week before Christmas. I hope this makes up for everything. Ill try to update as much and as quickly as I can.
~Chapter 11~ Shea's P.O.V
I wake up in my bed. I can hear 2 people arguining in the other room... One sounds like Seth...
I get up. Im wearing one of Seths T-shirts. No pants, and some socks. I walk out into the hallway.
"Seth! You cant just tell me to get out when we are making love!" I hear Ashley. Ugh.
"Ashley you know I loved you but I lost that when you cheated on my!" Seth yelled back. She cheated on him? Oh shit.
"Seth baby im sorry okay please lets just go and get out of here! Leave that fucking skank"
I hear Seth take a deep breath. "She is not a skank Ashley!"
I walk out now. "Ashley why dont you just fucking leave." I spit. Im done with her shit.
"Excuse me?" She says stepping passed Seth.
"You fucking heard me!" I say rasing my voice.
"Shea relax" Seth says cutting in.
"No Seth let me fuck this bitch up! Im done with her! And you to have the fucking nerve to come back here!" I shove her and she screaches like a little pussy.
"Did you just fucking shove me!?" She says pushing me back.
"Yeah I did. What are you going to do about it!?" I say yelling now.
She tackles me to the ground, pulling my hair, trying to punch me. She gets me good once and I punch her back right in the face and she flies back. I get ontop of her and punch her again. Shes crying. Good she is feeling the fucking pain I have had to go through walking in on them fucking! Ugh!
I get pulled off of her and help back. Seth talking softly in my ear to try to calm me. I shake him off and I go and run to my room, changing quick.
I start walking out of the house and Seth grabs my hand. I shake it off and start walking out of the house. I need to see my dad.
I start walking, just walking. 3O minutes later I show up at the graveyard. I make my way to my dads grave and I sit down.
"Hey dad" I choke out. I hold back my tears. "Things have been so hard," A tear escapes. I wipe it quick. "I-I just dont know what I am supposed to do Dad, I can't all this stress is killing me. I have just never felt this way for anyone and I-I caught him dad" I satrt sobbin. "Dad" I choke. "I need you. Its hard... Its so hard Dad." I sob more. "He cheated on me.. H-He fucking cheated!" I scream. All of this stress building up. Im never this emotional. Just with my dad, when Im with my dad. He was always the one there for me... I just so Vulnerable.
"Shea" I hear softly behind me. I turn my head Seth standing there out of breath, sweat on his forhead.
"Seth leave me the fuck alone. I dont give a shit what you have to say, I don't want you here" I say harshly Â turning back towards my dads grave.
"Shea listen to me, please"
"Fuck off!" I yell
"Fine Shea. Have it your way" I hear him walk off and scream in aggrivation. I sit there just looking at the plaq. My dads and silent tears just fall.
A hand goes on my shoulder and I flinch and look up. Casper standing there.
"Hey you okay?"
"Casper I-im not in the mood." I say softly.
"Hey Shea, c'mere" He says grabbing my hand and pulling me up. He pulls me into him, a warm hug. And I let him... I let him hug me.
