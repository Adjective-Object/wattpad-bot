"Mom! Mom look it's that necklace I've been talking non-stop about!"

"Where?" She asked.

"There! Right there, in that jewelry shop, can I please go get it before someone else does!"

"Yeah go-" She started saying, but I didn't even let her finish speaking before I started running to get the necklace before someone else did.

People probably thought I looked crazy with my ponytail falling out, and my glasses about to fall off my face but I didn't care at this point, all I kept looking at was the necklace, I was almost there.

Until i ran into someone.

Of course me of all people would do that, and draw a crowd of people to stop and stare.

"Oh my god I'm so sorry" I said to the person who i knocked down, yet i couldn't see there face because when i knocked them down i also knocked my glasses down too. I could barley make out pieces of paper blowing through the sky, this person must've had papers in there hand when i knocked them down.

"It's okay." A male voice said. That's when my hands landed on my glasses at the same time another hand did. I put them on and looked at the person I knocked down. At that very moment something strange happened.

"Hello." The boy stuttered. "What is your name?"

"Josephine." I replied. "And yours?"

"Elijah."
