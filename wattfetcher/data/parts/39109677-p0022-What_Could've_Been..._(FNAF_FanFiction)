Okay, so the last one was a cliffhanger, but with that whole "she talked!" thing, I have no idea how to do the next chapter... Every time I try to write it, it ends up looking like I rushed her into talking too early...
Oh! Happier note, ALMOST 200 READS! I"M AT 199!!! So, since I now sorta have a "slew" of readers (I HOPE!) I was wondering if you could help...?
Like, in comments, could you say if you want me to put off her talking until a later chapter (Will be more dramatic this way) or if it's fine if I just put her talking in this chapter...?  It may sound a bit rushed and crappy this way but I think people may want her to talk... Idk...
So... I'm hoping some people will respond, see you in da next chappie!
