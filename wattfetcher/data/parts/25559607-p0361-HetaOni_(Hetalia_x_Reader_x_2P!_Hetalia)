Italy smiled and spoke confidently, "Sure. I've got used to fighting, so I'll manage! The three of us will go there...and return as four~"


"At least we confirmed there was one monster there. It could come from any direction, so be careful. I wish I could come running to help you fight and find the frau, as soon as I'm done fixing this, but...it doesn't help that I'm barehanded. I'll stay alert, though." Prussia said, assembling the gun he held.


Nodding, Italy pat the Prussian's shoulder. Â "Take it easy. As soon as we find anything, we'll come back." he said before he walked around the table over to a certain Spaniard.



"The sword isn't so sharp now. It'll be a while until I'm done fixing it. Be careful, okay, Ita?" Spain told him.


Italy looked at the sword and nodded. "Yeah, okay!"



Seeing Japan standing in the kitchen in the top right corner of the room, Italy decided to check up on him.



"I'm a little hungry. won't you eat anything before you go?" Japan told him as he was preparing some food.


Italy's face brightened. "Wow, that looks so good! I guess I'll have some of that before I leave, then~"


"All right. I'll hurry up and make some for you, then." Japan nodded, turning to the chopping board.


Italy was about to walk away when Japan suddenly spoke up, "Wait...Italy..."


"What is it, Japan?" Italy asked curiously.


Japan faced him and spoke, "Are you sure you don't want me to accompany you there? I mean, I can look around for (Name)-chan while you guys investigate the parts of the annexe you wish to search through.


"Ah, mhmm... I think we're fine. You know, I care about (Name), too...but I don't think we should be that worried about her being with the Second Players." Italy said.


With a confused expression, Japan asked him, "Wh..Why so?"


"Haven't you noticed that they seem to show concern for (Name), too? I mean, we did see what happened earlier, si?" Italy asked.
