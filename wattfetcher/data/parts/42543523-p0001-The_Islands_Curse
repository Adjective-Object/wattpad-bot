1. Yadix Ishikawa- EUF agent. ES-class. Rank : #1 undercover agent. Katherine's twin sister (they dont look alike) She looks cold hearted in the outside but once you get to know her she's a sweet, nice, lovable person, and has a weak spot for animals. But she doesn't accept the fact that she's nice so she tries her best to hide it.
2. Katherine Ishikawa- EUF agent. ES-class. Rank: #4 undercover agent. Yadix's twin sister (they dont look alike) She's nice and always fashionable. She has a weak spot for clothing/shopping and style. She's still not a girly girl though.
3. Victoria Ishikawa- EUF agent. ES-class. Rank: #3 undercover agent. She's the oldest of the Ishikawa sisters soo she's very protective over them. She has a weird/twisted personality, but overall she's very creative and sweet.
4. Mitsuki Ishikawa- EUF agent. ES-class. Rank: #2 undercover agent. The youngest of the Ishikawa sisters. Has a very unique, entertaining and fun personality. She's one of those people who can break the akwardness/tension in the air. But don't let this little ball of sunshine trick you. She's #2 for a reason.
