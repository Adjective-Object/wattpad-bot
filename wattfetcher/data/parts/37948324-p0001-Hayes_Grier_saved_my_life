"Jessica get up ,we are going to your school at 7" my mom said. I got off the floor. My back was hurting, because I had to sleep on the floor. I got in shower and put some clothes on. I wore black joggers , black crop top , and some black vans. I really didn't care what I look like today. I went down stairs , and my mom was cooking some breakfasts. I ate my food, and went to my room and got my suitcase. I put all my stuff , in the car. I said bye to the house ,because we weren't coming back. Then we went to my school, so I could get my stuff out my locker. I went in the school,while my mom and dad stayed in the car. I got all my stuff ,and I was on my way out the door ,when somebody said " hey, asshole, were do you think you going." I turned around ,and there standing was ,Alex. Alex has been bullying scene I started middle school . She is why I cut myself. "I-I-I'm moving "I said scared. " Finally ,nobody want you here . nobody likes you. your just a SLUT ,nobody like . Oh , and one more thing , don't even think about tell 'your new friends' what I have been doing to you,or you will regret it " she said pushing me and walking away. I really hate her . I walked to my car sad, because she called me a slut ,and said I will  regret telling people what she has been doing to me. I'm just happy I am moving. *************************************"Jessica wake up , were here " my mom said shaking me. I look out my window, and we were pulling up to a big house. Omg! My dad stop the car and I hopped out the car really fast. my mom and dad got out of the car smiling at me . "So do u like it " my dad asked me .  "Yea ,but how"" Let's just say I have a nice job " my dad said open the door. I ran in the house . it was even bigger in the inside. I ran up the stairs to go find my room . I stop to a door that said ' Jessica 'on it. I walked in and it was hug .all my stuff was already in the room ,it was beautiful  I looked around the house. 3bedroom,2bathroom,  a movie room , a pool, a lake ,and more.It was around 5 pm ,so I decided to take a walk In the neighborhood . I told my mom and dad , and they told me to be careful .I was walking down my driveway and I saw some boys playing  football in the street . one of the boys had a vans shirt on and the other was shirt less . Then the next thing you know ,my face is hurting and I am on the ground. then I figured it out. I got hit with a football ."Oh my god ,are u ok" the shirtless one said "Yea" The shirtless boy help me up." I'm sorry about that" the boy with the vans shirt said ." It's ok " I sad rubbing my head ." I'm Hayes Grier and this Is my brother , nash Grier ,are you new here"."Yea and I am Jessica " I said shaking his hand. Nash went in the house while me and hayes got to know each other ." So how old are you?" He said "14,you""Me to"I got to learn a lot about hayes ,we have a lot in common. I told him I had to go home, because it was getting late. I went home and I went right to my room. I got in the shower and put on pjs ,and watch some tv till I fell asleep.
