"So," Cherryshine began, "is it true?"
Tawny stopped drinking the river water and looked up. "Is what true?"
"Why you left your clan. They said that you-"
Tawny interrupted her, "it's partially true. They still kept most parts of the story behind, but it's their secret to keep. Every clan has their own secrets."
Cherryshine nodded in understanding. "Anyways." She got up. "The day is getting late, you have a full day tomorrow to explore RiverClan. Let's go back," she said and flicked her tail towards the camp.
Tawny got up. "Maybe we should hunt first. The warrior code is still a big part of my life," she gave the deputy a small smile.
Cherryshine smiled back. "I'm glad it is, and you're right. Leaf-bare is coming so it's better to catch as many prey as we can before the river freezes."

"It's Morningwish," she quickly spoke. "She's kitting."
Silentfeather eyes grew wide and immediately got to work. "I'll be right there."
