"Save me!" he screamed. At least it sounded like Eggman sounding desperate for my help. After a hopeful jump, I spun into a ball and tore King Shahryar from the mouth of the pterodactyl, letting the king fall to the ground.
After he wiped the dust from his pants, his face seemed to redden as he watched me reach the ground. "How dare you?" He asked. "I am the king! Must you be so rude?"
With the slightest smile on my face, I shrugged. "Sorry!"
"Your highness," Shahra asked, "where did that spirit go?"
"It was as I feared." King Shahryar's face looked grave and he pointed somewhere. "He's gone to that castle over there. It seems that more minions are being assembled."
"There's a castle now?" I asked, looking towards his finger. Surely enough, across a small ocean, there was a big, glorious castle up ahead. It was certainly like turning the pages of a book. Everything changed quickly.
"It's a relic from an ancient kingdom..." Shahra explained. We both looked at it, and I couldn't help but marvel at it. I could only see the shadow, but it looked even larger than King Shahryar's castle. It had the same type of build, but even if it was only the shadow, I could tell that it was starting to fall apart.
"Let's go, Shahra," I told her, wanting to get the responsibility of King Shahryar off my back. Once the Erazor Djinn knew we had set him free, there was going to be trouble.
