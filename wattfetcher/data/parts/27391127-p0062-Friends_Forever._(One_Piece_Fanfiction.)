Anyways, before this idiot interrupted. I was going to say, that I appreciate everything. The votes, the reads and the comments. NowI have realized that my writing style has changed. Before I could barely write 1000 words but now, I'm reaching two thousand. It must be a sign.
Luffy: A sign that I will become the Pirate King!

Sakura: *sigh* 'Stay tuned for the next chapter.
Luffy: I'm gonna become the Pirate King.
*bonk*
