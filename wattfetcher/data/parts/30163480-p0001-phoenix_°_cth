both phoenix and calum are now 17, as in their senior year. they got very excited because it is the last year of school.
calum and phoenix are both completely opposite.
calum hates school but he loves sports. he's so friendly and also attractive. he gives good vibes to his surrounding. he's outgoing and other positive stuffs.
phoenix likes school. she sucked at sports. she's shy and she always stuck her nose in books, only when calum is not around. she doesn't really know how to socialise.
but, oppsite attracts.
she had been always there for calum and he had been always there for phoenix. they stick together no matter what.
