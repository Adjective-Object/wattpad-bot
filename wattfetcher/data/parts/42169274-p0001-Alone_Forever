AAAAAHH wow this hurts is the first thing that comes to my mind, not where am I or why does it hurt, just wow it hurts. I am a cruise ship designer who lives in New York in a small apartment. Well now I guess I am a random ass girl wearing a damp dress laying on a beach somewhere off of god knows where. I stand up but my salty dress is so stiff from salt water and blood I walk about two steps before taking it off. Now I know what hurts. Apparently getting a piece of thin metal stabbed in to your gut hurts. I faint from the sight. I wake up at sun down and I think I got here at noon. Ok time to focus. I gather myself and think about what was the first thing that all of the people in the books did. Get water. My first goal was to find water. But with this wound in my gut I couldn't move. And there I go again reminding myself that I had a piece of metal about an inch wide and five long. I went to clean it out in the blue mass of water I knew to be the ocean. Not a good idea. About two seconds too late I realized that I might get an infection by preventing one. I screamed like a bird in a blender. That really hurt I don't think I have the guts to pull it out of my gut. I lay on the ground for about half an hour then punch the sand hurting myself. I should really pull this thing out. Idea. Have you ever seen those videos where a kid has a loose tooth and can't pull it out so he puts a string on a door then slams it closed?  I'll do that but with a tree and run backwards and tie a string to the metal in my gut.
Oh yeah did I mention my sister is here too I think half dead.
