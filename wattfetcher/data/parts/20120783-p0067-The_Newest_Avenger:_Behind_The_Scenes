"Hmmm?" I quietly responded.
"I asked you what you thought."
"Oh, yeah. Sounds great and stuff."
"Then it's settled."
"And...Cut!" We returned to our normal selves and received our notes from Joss. After that, we did the scene a few more times. I still had no idea what they were saying, as I actually wasn't paying attention. I guess you can say I was in character.
While we took a break so they could change the camera angle, I put my head down on the table. I closed my eyes to rest them, but I ended up falling asleep.
Robert's Pov:
"Well why don't we ask her. Summer, what do you think?" I said my line and looked over at her.
"Summer?" I waited for her to respond but she never did.
"Summer!" I yelled, still nothing.
"She's asleep isn't she," I sighed. Mark chuckled and walked in front of her. She indeed was asleep and was out cold. I decided to be nice and not do the ice bucket on her. So I shook her awake instead.
"Alexis wake up."
"No."
"Yes."
"No"
"Do you want the ice bucket?"
"...fine." She put her head up and we finished off the scene. We filmed more scenes in the lab for the rest of the day and I think Alexis snuck in a few more naps. At the end of the day, we all went back to the hotel and fell right to sleep after our long day.
Sorry again for the semi boring chapter. But it kinda had to happen so.
The song in the chapter is C'mon by Panic! At The Disco featuring Nate Ruess.
I hope you all enjoyed and I will see you all next week :)
