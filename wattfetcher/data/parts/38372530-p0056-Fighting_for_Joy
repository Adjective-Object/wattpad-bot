Hey yall! I know, I haven't been updating as of recent and it's because I'm stuck! So, I was thinking to put the book on hold until I can think of something but, a few other people I consulted with on Wattpad told me absolutely not.
So, I decided to talk to you guys and figure out what you would like to see. Part of the reason I want to put this on hold is because I feel like in ways, I'm not giving you all what you'd like to see in this book.
So in interim, I would like to know what you all think should happen next and also what would you like to see in this book. I have a chapter coming tonight, it's just a filler so comment so I can come back and write for this book like I would like to.
Thank yall
