"I need a drink." I said leaving my band behind and going over to where the liquor was. Maybe if I got a little alcohol in my system I would be just fine. I grabbed a plastic cup and poured some whiskey into it. I looked around the bus at everyone laughing and having fun and took a drink wincing a little at first but ignored it and chugged the rest of it down. I poured some more before walking around to the corner where Austin was standing as Alan walked off to take more photos.
"Hey man," He said as soon as I came up to him.

"Hey and I think you're trying too hard." I said to him.
"Trying too hard?"
"Alan clearly isn't interested in you."
"Sure he is." He scoffed, "He's just playing hard to get."
"It kind of looks like the only thing he's interested in is taking pictures," I said and leaned up against the wall taking a long drink.
"I'll get him. The guys keep telling me to stay away but no."
"Maybe you should follow their advice and just let him come to you or something." I suggested.
"I'm slightly taking it, I mean he just broke up with someone so I'm backing off. But I'm still gonna get him one way or another."
"Sure you are."
"I am, he's cute and I bet he's great in bed."
"Why would you think that?" I asked crinkling my nose as I looked at Alan, "He looks way too innocent."
"He's quiet too and as people say, it's always the quiet ones."
"Uh huh," I said laughing a little. "Whatever you say Aust."
"Come on, you have to admit he's hot."
I shook my head, "He's not my type."
"Well he is most definitely mine."
"You can have him." I assured him, "Like I said, not my type."
"Well at least I have no one to compete with." He said looking over at Alan.
"What are you going to do if he's not into you?"
"I have no idea, who knows maybe I'll be an idiot and call Jaxin again." He laughed.
"How about you don't do that." I said remembering how bad their break up was. It was about as bad as mine and Cara's maybe even worse to be honest.
"He was great in bed though."
"He was also a major asshole."
"I know, but make up sex was the best part."
"It's all about sex for you isn't it?" I asked laughing.
"Most of the time, I'm not really a relationship guy. You know that."
"Yeah I know you're not. Hopefully Alan could change that." I said finishing off my whiskey.
"Maybe he will, but I doubt it."
"So you basically just wanna fuck him and go?" I asked.
"Basically." He said, "You should try it, it doesn't cause as much drama as relationships do. I mean you'll never have to deal with a bitch like that one chick again."
