Hesitantly, I answered the call. "Hello?"


"H-Hello?" I heard a soft voice at the end of the line.



"Uhm, who is this?" I asked nervously.


I heard the other person sigh in, from what I can sense, relief. "I'm...so glad I was able to reach you..." he said.

I felt elated when I heard the person say that, thinking that he could be someone I knew. That is, until he finished his sentence.





"....(Name)."






I felt my insides suddenly wither. I clicked my tongue and replied, "Oh, I'm sorry."




"No, it's alright, we were just so wor—"





"—Wait, no. I mean, I'm sorry. You've got the wrong person." I informed him.





"What? (Name)? I know it's you. I would recognise your voice anywhere."
he said confidently. It sort of ticked me off a little. Are people playing a joke on me or something?





Annoyed, I tightened my grip on the phone. "(Name), (Name), (Name)! Why do people keep mistaking me for that little girl?! It's not funny anymore! I'm not her. My name is (Second Name)!"




The line went silent for a moment, until I heard him reply with the same soft voice. "(Second...Name)?"  he said in an unsure tone.




"Yes, that's right. Now, how about you?" I asked, calming down a little as I heard my name being spoken.
