Greta's POV
Hi. I'm Greta. Short for Margaret. I'm 16. I've got dark curly red hair and brown eyes. I live with my dad, older brothers Noah and Aiden, younger brother Elliot and my dogs Roxy and Harley.
My mom left us when I was 6. I never forgave her for what she did. She ran away to Paris with a model, my now step dad Ryan, and now I have a snotty, bratty 10 year old half sister Hailey. I've met her a couple times when my brothers and I fly out to Paris every couple months for a week.
I guess you could say I was mad at my mom because she left for no good reason. My dad, brothers and I never did anything wrong.
Anyway forget about my parents divorce. I want to tell you about my obsession.
People may think I'm a freak. It's not my fault that I obsess over music so much. I just like music. I can name any song playing and the artist. I could learn an instrument in a day. I could learn a new song in 5 minutes.
Some people are jealous, others taunt me, some use it to make me look like a freak, but I don't care. I love music. It's a way to express what I'm feeling and to slip into a world where I fit in and nothing is ever bad.
The bass guitar. It's my instrument I specialize in. Yeah I can play the piano or saxophone or violin, but the bass guitar is my favorite instrument. I play double bass and cello in orchestra at school and that's all what people know me for. A classical music kinda girl. At school I was just a normal classy sophomore.
But no. That's not me at all. I'm actually a heavy metal, rock and roll superstar inside. At home I dressed in the spunkiest clothes I owned and rocked on my bass all day. I guess I just wasn't really ready to put myself into the world yet. Not till now.
N/A So you got to know a little about Greta. I thought I'd just do the first chapter about her so you knew her a little bit. I'll try to post as often as possible.
