He took a pistol out, and pointed it to the sky
Screaming out to the world, "I knew this reality was just a lie!"
Every time he heard the words, "You're crazy" be spoken
Every time his heart became more chipped up and broken
To him, it was all just a test
To prove if he could be stronger than the rest
But he couldn't, he didn't hold out long enough
Coldness settled where his heart got hauled away in cuffs
He emptied the gun except for a final bullet
He payed no attention to the ones telling him to not do it
He raised it to his brain, and stared at the trigger as long as time would permit
But finally the giant bang told the world that the man had pulled it
