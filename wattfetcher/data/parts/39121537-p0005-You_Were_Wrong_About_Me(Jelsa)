Everything she doesn't see.

(You got to) you gotta speak up, (You got to) you gotta shout out,
And know that right here, right now,
You can be beautiful, wonderful,
Anything you wanna be,
Little me

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
Everything she doesn't see.

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,
And know that right here, right now,
You can be beautiful, wonderful,
Anything you wanna be,

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out,
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder,
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
Everything she doesn't see.

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out,
And know that right here, right now,
You can be beautiful, wonderful,
Anything you wanna be,

Little Me


When I was done, there was a defining sound of applause. I smiled and went to go to the changing room, when someone grabbed my hand.

It was a guy with fair skin, orange hair, sideburns, brownish green eyes, and a warm smile on his face.

"Hey I saw you sing up there, and you were amazing."

"Thank you!"

"My name is Hans South. I am the owner of Frozen records in New York. I was wondering if you would like a record deal?"

"Are you kidding? YES!"

"Great, so I will see you in New York in three days."

"Wait, I have to move?"

He nodded his head.

"No, I can't leave my sister behind. She needs me."

"Well, this is a once in a life time opportunity. I will give you two days to think about it. What is your name?"
