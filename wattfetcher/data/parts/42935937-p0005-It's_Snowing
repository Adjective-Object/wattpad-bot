My summer was pretty awesome. I hung out with my friends, slept in and swam. Pretty much a normal summer. Oh but one thing was so awesome!!! I was texting Melissa, Maddy and B when I got a text. Sara was coming back to Canada!!! Sara had come to Canada in grade 7 for one year and she kinda got all the drama started and she taught us all about guys, shopping and everything else like that. I was so happy! In just a week I would see all my friends and Jay! I got together with Melissa and Sara a few days later and it turns out Sara had been dating a guy in Mexico named Janito but they broke up right before she left. Anyway school starts in a few days so we went out shopping. Melissa was totally obsessing over seeing Quentin again. "Omg he is so amazing like how could everyone not love him!" Melissa explained. Me and Sara just rolled our eyes.
