My favorite girl
You're used to goin' out your way
To impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that can't be real
So girl let's write a fairytale
And show 'em how we feel
You're who I'm thinkin' of
Girl you ain't my runner up
And no matter what
You're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
Baby it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
You take my breath away
With everything you say
I just wanna be with you
My baby, my baby, oh
Promise to play no games
Treat you no other way
Than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
You're my favorite girl
(My favorite, my favorite)
Favorite girl, favorite girl, favorite girl
(My favorite, my favorite girl, my favorite girl)
Favorite girl, favorite girl, favorite girl
