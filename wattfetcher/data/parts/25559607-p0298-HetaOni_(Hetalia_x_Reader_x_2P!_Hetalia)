Well, I was wrong.
Because as I said that, they stopped quarrelling and all turned to me.
"...'Second Players'...?"
Ah, dammit.

///Third Person PoV///
When Italy made sure that Past Germany already exited the room and is out of earshot, he let out a big sigh of relief.
"Phewww!! What a scare!! I almost had a heart attack!! Ahhh, thank God! Germany, you can come out now~! Wow, scolded by Prussia, then hit by me...talk about adding insult to injury, huh~?" Italy said playfully.
Walking up to the curtain in the top left corner where Germany hid, Italy spoke, "Hey, Germany, I was talking to you!... What, are you sulking?"
"I'm not sulking! It's just...I'm s-so weak...Dammit!" Germany answered, walking out of the space behind the curtain.
Italy tilted his head. "Oh, were you that upset about it? You don't have to worry. I was even worse the first time around. I mean, everyone but me was wiped out, you know." he said, causing Germany to fall silent.
"Everyone died right before my eyes. The pure white piano, the pure white sheets, the pure white beds, the pure white floor, they were all painted a deep red." Italy said, voice cracking a bit.
Germany nodded. "...Yes."
"But you know, no one blamed me. Everyone smiled at me. And then they told me, 'I'm sorry I couldn't be by your side till the end...' You and Prussia were the last to die. I just couldn't believe it. I started...breaking everything in the house. There  was no one to stop me or get mad at me...I was ready to give up. It was...pretty tough..."
Italy explained, looking down and rubbing his arm. "That was the first time. As in, the time before this time loop we're in right now. I'm so jealous that you have someone to get mad at you." he said, facing Germany.
"...I'm sorry. It must be hard to talk about..." Germany apologised.
Italy shook his head. "That's thanks to everyone. Anyway, Germany, why don't we go look for the journal now?"
"Hm? Oh, right. But I want you to wait. Can I just ask you one thing?" Germany said, his voice getting softer.
"Uh, sure." Italy motioned him to continue.
"I want you to let me see this world's Italy. Or rather, I'm going to see him. Are you coming with me?" Germany asked.
Italy thought for a moment, then shook his head. "No, I'd...rather not...I mean, he's dead and all...I'll be waiting for you in the hallway."
"Sorry. I'll be right back." Germany said as he left the room.

Germany headed to the room across the fireplace room on the second floor. As he entered the room, he saw the deceased Past Italy laid down on the carpet in the centre of the room, surrounded by flowers.
Walking over to the body silently, he clenched his fist. He knelt down and spoke softly,  "How strange. Not long ago...you were desperately trying to stop us at the front door... ...I'm so sorry. There are...so many things...I want to tell you...Haa..."
He paused for a moment, feeling his eyes water and a lump form in his throat."So this is what it feels like...to lose a friend. This won't do. I just keep blinking more and more...First...an apology...I'm sorry I laughed at your valuable opinion.
