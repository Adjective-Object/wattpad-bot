" Mom I'm back with the   medicine. It was expensive so I have to work to pay off my debt" He said to his mom.
His mom was laying down on the old couch, by some opened windows. She had a wet rag on her forehead. A ripped blanket covered her sick body. Enrique sat on the floor looking at her. Sweat was dripping from his mom's forehead. Her body was shaking and she coughed weakily. He opened the bottle and poured a little on the cap of the bottle. He leaned forward and his mom weakily cranked the medicine. She smiled weakily and went to sleep. Enrique got up and headed outside the house. He closed the door behind him and got inside the Hummer.
" Is she ok with you working for me?" Asked Fausto putting his phone away.
" She said it's ok" he replied.
Fausto nodded and started the truck and drove off. The ranch seemed far to Enrique. They were far away from the town.
"Listen, I am your "Boss". You work for me and if you like it, I will offer you a better position. You will help one of my guy's cut wood" said Fausto.
"Ok and is the ranch far?" Enrique asked.
"Yes but don't worry its gonna be fine" Fausto answered.
A few minutes later, they arrived at the ranch. The ranch had a lot of trees and the house was beautiful. It was painted a light brown and the edges were a darker brown. The front door had a beautiful glass design of angels. Two marbel columns were the entrance to the front door. The house had French windows. A fountain by the arch driveway made the whole house magnificent. The Hummer stopped by the the 2 marvel columns. Fausto and Enrique got off and walked to the side of the house.
