France, Japan, and all the other countries except Italy sat up, as well. They looked at each other and nodded. "We need to discuss about this...'Second Player' business." England informed the American.



".....Oh. That." America said monotonously.



China sighed. "....I still can't believe that this is all their doing, aru."



"They've killed millions of people, set fire to numerous villages, and caused chaos and mass destruction around the world during the war--before we banished them...how could you not believe that they could do such an unforgivable act like this?" Germany asked, clicking his tongue.

"That's right. They're desperately trying to get rid of us now... Even to the point of putting Italy in such pain, and (Name) through so much danger--and deceit." France said, his gaze at the Northern Italian and the girl's sleeping forms.



Spain tilted his head. "Then what do you propose for us to do about it?"



"How about instead of us being hunted down by them ...we hunt them down?" Japan suggested.
