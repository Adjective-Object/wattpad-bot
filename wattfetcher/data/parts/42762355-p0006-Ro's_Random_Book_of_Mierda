Today I was looking for a motorbike from the internet. You see, I plan on getting my license next year and need to practice driving.
I stumbled upon this beautiful baby! A black-n-white Yamaha GT, model year 2013. 700 € and it's in Mäntyharju. Mäntyharju is about three hours from here. It's just a perfect bike. It even has scarlet wheels... //Vanteet in Finnish--// It isn't even that old and the prize is good. And it doesn't have many kilometers... * 7 *
I really want my own motorbike! Brother said I could have his, but I have never had anything of my own... The bicycle I have at the moment is my first one that didn't come from my siblings. All of my clothes are their old ones. I could sell his bike and use some of the money for buying this Yamaha!
Damnit... I will never get a motorbike tho. My parents think I don't deserve it...
