" yes sir " he said
" now youngest daughter its very rude to easedrop " my dad said.
Then my heart dropped so I walked out of my hiding place and came to face my dad and justin
" hey daddy" I said innocently
" we know you were ease dropping" justin spoke up
" psssst what me never" I said
" nice try " they said in Union
"Come on Justin I think its time to meet my mom " i winked glad my dad didn't see
" ok " he said getting up and smiling
Justin POV
" come on Justin I think its time to meet my mom " she winked
" ok " I said getting up
" kylie " I whispered walking by the bathroom then the door
opened and someone pulled me in and the light turned on and I was face to face with kylie
" well hello shawty" I said wiggling my eyebrow
Kylie laughed then crashed her lips with mine and I licked her bottom lip begging for entrance which she granted and our tongue fought to dominance of course I let her win and picked her up and sat her one the counter and pulled away for air and rested my head on hers and pecked her lips
" let's go before your parents think anything " I said picking her up off the counter and grabbing her hand and turning out the light and sneaking out the bathroom hand and hand
" where have you guys been "her mom asked and I looked at kylie then said
" we were in the study with Scott" I said gripping Kylie's hand tighter
" oh really " she said with wide eyes
" that's what I said too mom " kylie said
" no one ever goes in the study " her mom said
See told you he would like me
So what
I was right and so was kylie
I have nothing to worry about
" justin you hungry " kylie said looking up at me
" huh " I said snapping out of my trance
" are you hungry" she repeated
" yeah " I said
" is spaghetti ok "she asked
" yeah its my favorite" I smiled
" here hope you don't mind warm- ups " she asked
" no worries its fine" I said sitting at the table with kylie and her mom
" well go sit at the table its ready" she said
" kylie can you go get your dad " Shannon asked
" yeah" kylie said walking of
" Justin just don't hurt my daughter she's been through a lot I dont know if she told you but I don't think she wants to talk about it this is the first time I have seen her smile. In a while. So please don't hurt her she's herself again" her mom said with a tear in her eye but she wiped it away before I could say anything
" I promise. I won't hurt her I never could live with my self if I did" I said
