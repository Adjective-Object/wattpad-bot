Lythia-"WOW!!"
Aubrey-"Do I really have to have you as my roommate"
Lythia-"Be quiet I'm just really excited! Aren't you?"
Aubrey-"I am! I'm just beat from the long drive"
Lythia-"We still have to get the rest of our stuff. You know that right"
Aubrey-"I do now"
Lythia-"Lets go now then, It's almost noon already!"

Lythia-"Yay!"

Aubrey-"I thinkÂ  that's everything"
Lythia-"It better be, cause now I'm beat!"
Aubrey-"UGH we have to start UNPACKING"
Lythia-"Crap!"

A few minutes after unpacking Lythia falls asleep

Aubrey-"Hey Lythia I need help over..."
Lythia-"....."
Aubrey-"...Here"

Lythia is sleeping so peacefully on the bed she made before hand...The bed made so perfectly with sheets filled with laughing cat faces all over It! (Really Lythia why do you have such a cat fetish?! What if someone comes in and sees all of these cat posters, clothes and especially the freaking bed spread?!)

Lythia-"Hmm?"
Aubrey-"Huh!"

(Oh no I didn't mean to wake her up!)

Aubrey-"Oh uhh Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep little kitty"

(Little Kitty?! What am I thinking?!)

Lythia-"....."
Aubrey-"It worked!...Figures"

-Few Minutes Later-

Lythia-"A-Aubrey?"
Aubrey-"...Huh! What?"
Lythia-"Come here"
Aubrey-"Uhh okay"
Lythia-"...I had a dream that you were singing a lullaby to me earlier"
Aubrey-"What?! Your funny! That must've been a crazy dream!"
Lythia-"Guess so"
Aubrey-"So how was your cat nap?"
Lythia-"Cat nap?...IT WAS YOU!!!!"
Aubrey-"Shhhhhh!! Be quiet! Hehe"
Lythia-"I've never heard you sing before"
Aubrey-"That's because I don't sing"
Lythia-"You should it makes me feel calm around you"
