I stare at the giant creature, as I get up from the ground. "What is that?!" Bunny shouted. "I don't know, but whatever it is, it's breaking down the wall!" Andy shouted, as giant weirdly shaped things walked in. "Run!" We all scattered. Andy with Kat, Leaf with Cloud and Bunny, and me, by myself. But I had to get to my mom anyways.
"Mom? Where are you?" I shout, running around the house, but there was no sign of her.
I sigh and lean against the wall, sliding down into a sitting position. Probably not the best idea to sit outside. I look up and see a giant glaring down at me, mocking me with that creepy smile.
I gasped in fear, not knowing what to do. Just then, I see a leg hanging from the titans mouth. I put my hand over my mouth thinking that was my only family left.
Just then, the titan reached it's hand out to me, I guess to pick me up and totally devour me.
I back up more against the wall. Just as the titan was nearing me, a person came by and grabbed my wrist, running off with me.
It was a boy, who looked around my age, but a bit older. I shook my head, trying to keep up with this boy while he held my wrist.
"Who are you?" I asked, as we came to a stop for a break. He turned around, and looked down at me a little, with me being short and all.
"My name is Eren."
