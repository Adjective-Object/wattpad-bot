"Just let me go back to moping. I'm an idiot and I have started to accept it." He told me trying to pull his hand out of my grip.
"You're not an idiot. Why would you think that?" I asked him frowning.
"Because I fucked up on one of my term papers."
"That doesn't mean you're an idiot. It was one paper you'll be okay."
"One paper?! Vic this paper's most of my grade for a class, they aren't easy! I've been working on it for nearly a month and I fucked it all up."
"Calm down. How did you fuck it up?"
"I forgot to add this one thing about a theorem."
"And that ruined your paper?" I asked shocked.
"Yes, I got and F a big fat F! I'm going to fail and never graduate now."
"I'm sure one F isn't going to make you fail and never graduate." I told him trying to calm him down.
"I can barely handle getting a B on a paper what makes you think I can handle an F. My parents have been freaking out about it too, they won't leave me alone. I've gotten calls and text telling me to stop touring around with some 'stupid' band and get home so I can properly study."
"Are you going to?" I asked slightly panicked.
"No I'm not leaving.  My parents don't own me, I'm twenty one years old. I've been on my own for three years." He said like it was obvious, "But that's now the point! I'm going to fail college and end up being some loser who lives in a shitty apartment with like twenty cats!"
"Kells. Everything is gonna be alright. Can you make it up or redo it?"
"No I can't make it up! And everything is not going to be okay. I'm a fucking idiot and this is going to ruin my 4.0."
"You have to calm down and breathe. You still can change it overtime."
"I don't know Vic, what place would want to hire an idiot who failed a term paper?" He asked, "I'm a failure!"
"Kells you need to just calm down. Look at me," I said and took his face in my hands squishing his cheeks, "You are a genius Kells, I've seen what you can do with numbers and shit, you will be just fine and anyone who doesn't want to hire you are the idiots. Now calm down and breathe!"
He looked at me and took a deep breath.
"There we go," I said smiling, "Now repeat after me, I am a mini genius and I will be the best math major this world has ever seen."
"I'm not saying that."
"Kellin."
He sighed, "I am a mini genius and I will be the best math major this world has ever seen."
"Good, now are you calmed down?" I asked and he shook his head. He looked so adorable with his cheeks all smashed up like this. It was so cute and I really wanted to kiss him and god I think I'm going to have to ask him out soon just because he's too adorable and he's not going to wait forever and the band and the girls and basically everyone is right and I am going to ask him out tomorrow when he's not stressing out over this paper.
"I don't think I'm going to ever calm down." He admitted and I sighed letting go of his squished face.
"Okay, well then I guess we're just going to have to do something to distract you from it all." I said and Kellin frowned.
"But I just wanna go pout and accept my fate." He whined and I shook my head and stood up.
