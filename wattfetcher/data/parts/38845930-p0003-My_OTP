Jordan's POV
I'm at Erin's picking her up to go to Chad's house and she comes down the hall. she has a purple t-shirt and regular jeans but she looks so... cute?
Erin's POV
I walk down the hallway of my house and Jordan is there and I didn't know he was gonna be, but I could tell he was confused or focused on something as if I had something on my face.
"H-hey Erin, w- w- whats up?" He asked
"Nothing. Whats up with you?"
"Uuh... I...nothing. What? Wait."
"Okay Jordan. I didn't know you were gonna be here."
"Yeah I am here. I'm gonna taking you -take you to Chaz - Chad's."
"Jordan, what the hell?" I said
"Let's - I just - let's go now?"
Oh my god what is wrong with him? Is he seriously nervous?
We get to Chad's house and Jordan is all nervous about eating meal worms and crickets but he is only nervous when talking to me.
What is wrong with Jordan? I don't understand.
Jordan's POV
Oh my god what is wrong with me? I can't talk to Aurey without being like "eh - uhh- gah - buuh." I'm nervous. I don't know why but I'm nervous. Erin Is eating her food and as I'm looking at her she is feeling a little uneasy and starts to look at me as if she is gonna throw up and needs me to give her the trash can to throw up in but I got lost in her eyes and...
Erin's POV
So I ate the food, (popcorn, maple syrup, ketchup, beef, and charred marshmallow.) and I was about to throw up and I looked at Jordan and asked him to get me the trash can and he just stared at me like he was staring me at my house and then just as I was throwing up he jumped grabbed the trashcan and stuck it under me, it almost missed thanks to Jordan being oblivious and not thinking... or thinking to much. He just stared at my face and into my eyes.
