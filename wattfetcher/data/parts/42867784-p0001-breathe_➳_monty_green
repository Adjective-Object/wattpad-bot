Jasmine Knight was trained since she was three years old. There was a special program on the Ark that only council members knew about and never spoke about apart from the Knight family.
The Knight program.
It was made to train children at a young age in order for them to become elite soldiers. Since Jasmine's family started the program, she had to be in it.
From the start, Jasmine never gave up. She became courageous, smart, quick, and a warrior. Then, she was deemed a threat.
Jasmine was locked up in the sky box for assaulting and killing guards. At age seventeen, Jasmine was going to be sent to the ground as part of the one hundred. She was going to Earth.
"which is ironic considering she could now b r e a t h e on Earth."
