"We could take him with us!" She says.
"Are you fucking crazy Lena!?" I ask.
"No swears!" The little boy scolds Jeff.
"Watch it kid." I point my knife at his face.
"Please Jeff? At least until we figure out what to do with him?" She asks, taking my hand.
I glare at her and roll my eyes. "Fine!" I snap. "But he's your damn responsibility and if he pisses me or my dog off, he's gone!" I warn her. She smiles and walks up to the kid.
"Come with us, sweetheart." She holds out her hand. The way she talks to him is sort of cute.
"Mommy says not to talk to strangers." He responds, backing away.
"I'm a friend of your Mommy, okay? What's your name?" She asks him, holding his hand.
"Wyatt." He tells her.
"Come on, Wyatt. You don't need to be scared, okay?" The little boy reluctantly advances toward her. She picks him up and we begin to walk home.
"Who's that man holding mommy?" The little boy whispers not too quietly to her.
"His name is Jeff." She replies, looking right at me with her big blue eyes.
"Is he nice?" He asks her.
She chuckles. "Kinda."
