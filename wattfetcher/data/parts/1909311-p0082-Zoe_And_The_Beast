"Where did you go?"
His voice was so sharp it was cutting ice. I could feel my heart immediately start pounding, and have fear overpower me. Turning my head, I stared straight ahead at Beast, who stood completely tattered.
His hazel eyes were glazed and rimmed red, his torn – yet beautiful - lips were slanted down, and his muscular physique was stiff, almost forcefully. A tan arm was holding onto the chair beside him, as if the chair was the only thing keeping him up. Betrayal was written all over his face.
Hesitating, I hitched my breath and approached him carefully. "I don't think you're okay, Vince. Let's get you checked out, all right?"
He scowled, blinking. "I'm fine. Where did you go?"
"Vince, are you sure-"
I shrieked.
Beast had flung forward, and had trapped me against the wall, his red eyes piercing straight at me. A growl arose from his lips. "I asked you a question. Where did you go?"
He was breathing heavily, almost gasping as he spoke, his lips turned up into a scowl. His breath smelled nasty – not quite like alcohol, but nothing healthy. Something was off, and not in a good way.
"Beast, please get off me." I spoke as calmly as I could, trying to push him off with my hands. I felt helpless, utterly helpless when he had me trapped like that, and I wanted that feeling to stop.
"Are you leaving me?" he whispered, softly, his face slowly molding into an epitome of agony. His eyes lost their acuity, and the scowl fell off his lips, leaving a trace of torture behind. "Are you going to leave me too?"
Tears rimmed Beast's eyes, pleading to drop.
Words couldn't come out of my mouth. Beast thought I was leaving him?
"Don't leave me, Zoe" he continued, his arms dropping to his sides, his eyes shutting in pain. "Please don't leave me."
And with that, Beast fell to the floor.
