I walked to the local marketplace. It was dark. No one was within my line of vision. I glance through the canned food isle. Still there's no one. I keep walking. I come to a stop at the deli food isle. An old man slowly walks to the other side of the isle. I ignore him. A boy my age walks in front of me. I stop.
"Sorry, but may you please move?" I ask politely.
"Aw, sweetheart," He says in a voice, that sounds very irritating.
"Are you mocking me?"
"Aw, why would I do that?" This time, his voice sounds mature.
I glance at him. He doesn't move.
"You part of the Rebels, sweetie?" He asks.
"No," I reply, with a vivid expression on my face.
"Well," He starts-"I can't just trust you, y'know?"
The boy grabs my arms firmly, and drags me out of the marketplace.
"Let go of me!" I yell.
"Oh dear, sweetie, you must come with me," He winks at me.
Ugh, I think to myself, why is this boy dragging me away? What does he want from me? Is he with the Rebels? Is he taking me to the Rebels, and possibly join them? Even though, after I've been invited to join the Rebels fifteen times, I'm not ready to join such a terrorist group. Let go of me, boy! Let go of me!
I yank my hand out of his grip, and then I run.
He chases me.
"Get back here, sweetie," He says calmly.
"I will never come back!" I shout.
I run down Blacklard Boulevard, and then I run down Plumberry Drive.
He's still on my tail.
I leap over a large fence, and then jump over electrical wire.
I'm free! I'm free!

The boy stops chasing me.
