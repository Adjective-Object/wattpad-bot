Snow: Why are Ursula and Cruella here?
YourMajesty : Emma and I let them in.
Charming: WHY???
YourMajesty : Take a chill pill Charming. They want to change and I'm in no position to judge them.
Snow: But I am! They better not go anywhere near my daughter!
EmmaIsSavior : Chill out you two! I can take care of myself! Plus if I can't my boyfriend will help.
Charming: Don't remind me.
EmmaIsSaviour : What do you suppose we do?
YourMajesty : I don't know. Very humble name btw.
EmmaIsSaviour: You're one to talk "YourMajesty".
Snow: Regina pretend to be on the inside and figure out what they're hiding.
YourMajesty : Yes your highness.
Snow: Shut up.
