Today I woke up by myself without Ashley's help. I was pretty sure that she was still asleep. I went to the bathroom very quietly to make sure I don't wake her up, she usually pissed in the morning. I went to brush my teeth and take a long and relaxing shower.

After about an hour I got out of the shower with my towel wrapped around my body. I went and picked out an outfit. I headed downstairs to go to the kitchen to pick up a snack, and then I went to the living room and noticed that Ashley was on the couch sleeping like a baby and she left the TV on. I turned off the TV and then went upstairs to get my purse. After a few minute I finally found it under my bed. I went downstairs and I was all ready to go to the mall. I left a note for Ashley and headed out the door quietly.

"Man there is so much traffic today," I said to myself. I turned up the radio so I could keep myself from sleeping. I could barley keep my eyes open now and I was yawning like crazy. Boom! I opened my eyes just a little bit and noticed that something happened to the car in front of me. I rubbed my eyes to see what really happened. I noticed that I crashed into the car in front of me. The guy got out of his car and he looked at his bumper. "Uh oh," I said to myself and then got out the the car.

I got out of the car and looked at my bumper. It was in pretty bad shape. I put my hand through my brown hair. The thing that made me pretty mad is that I got that car from my grandpa who was dead. I promised him that I would keep it in good condition but I broke the promise. The girl got out of her car and looked at my bumper and then she looked at me with a innocent face. "I'm so sorry, I'll pay for the damages," she said still giving me that innocent look. Then she was digging in her purse for something. She got out her insurance card and gave it to me. "Well what's done is done," said to her in my British accent. The police arrived and got everything straighten out. The girl left and I was pretty sure she was crying. I went inside my car and then went to the car repair shop.

I went straight home after the incident. I wiped the tears off of my face and tried to stop crying. About 7 minutes of total silence in my car, I was home. I parked into the garage and went inside. I saw Ashley in the kitchen finding something to eat. "What's wrong," she asked me with a concern face. I told her everything and she looked surprised. "It's okay," she told me while giving me a hug. I was happy that she wasn't mad at me for crashing her favorite car and that is why I love her as my friend.

We were in the stadium and I have to say it it very big. Ashley was all dressed up for the game. It took us time to find our seat but we found it. It was in the middle part of the bleachers. I looked around to see people with their friends and family. It kind of made me a little sad because I didn't have a family anymore but I was happy that I had Ashley.  When the game started, Ashley was jumping around and yelling. I told her to calm down and so then she called me boring. "When will this end," I said to myself groaning.
