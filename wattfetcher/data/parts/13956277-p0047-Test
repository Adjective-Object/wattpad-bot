"50,59,16,70,26,20,47 ........ *sigh* 890 please" I saw Damon and Elina with the pinky standing with their mouthes open in surprise.
"You're faster than a machine" Damon said.
"Yeah, I try ... I got the job then ?" I smiled widely.
"Diffenately" The pinky woman was still amazed.
"I don't wanna seem rude, but how much am I gonna get paid ?" I asked shyly.
"Since you're a student, I think you won't be able to come more than 4 days a week, So, Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday. From 4pm to 8pm for 380$ and you'll get extra money if you work more, Is that Okay with you" She smiled.
"Yes Yes totally" I answered enthusiastically.
"But don't expect to blink in these 4 hours because you have to deserve the dollarsÂ  or you wont get them, if there weren't much costomors, you'll help with tiding and organizing the clothes, I liked your speed and that's why I offered that much of money"
"Don't worry, I won't dissappoint you, can we leave now" I smiled.
"Yes"
......
"There's no way I'm gonna let you drive home" Damon said.
"Scared ?" I teased.
"Of course I am ! This babe coasts 40 thousands" He kissed the car.
"Ewwww" Elina wrinkled her nose
....
"Come on, We don't wanna be late for the sleepover" Elina took my bag and threw it in the car.
"Okay I'm coming" I jumped in the car.
"Be careful, don't break it" He teased.
"Ha ha, funny. Take us to Molly" I commanded.
"Okay, I'm under your commands miss" He started the car as Elina hopped beside him.
....
We reached Molly's house, Elina got out of the car before me and took the bags with her
"You're welcome" He said and I chuckled.
"Thanks" I got out.
"I miss you already, Juliet" He's a good actor. I laughed.
"Stop the cheesiness, Salaam" I turned around to get in the house.
"Wa Alaykom al salaam" I froze.
"What did you say" I asked Damon.
"Isn't that how you say it ?" He asked.
"Yes, It perfectly is" I smiled.
"LEEENAAAAA YOU BETTER COME IN NOW" Elina shouted.
"You better get in before you loose an eye, Salaam" Damon gave me a warm smile, turned the car on and left.
