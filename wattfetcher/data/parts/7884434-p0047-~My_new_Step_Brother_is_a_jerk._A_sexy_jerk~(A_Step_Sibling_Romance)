My pants drop to the ground and I look up at Seth as two of his fingers press against my core, even that feeling like something so unexplainable.
The fabric of my thong is the only thing separating his complete touch.
(Replay the song if you have too)
I bite my lip softly, a deep blush on my cheeks as I nod to him.
He looks in my eyes as he pulls the thong off of me.
My legs close from being so naked in front of him. "Baby i'm not going to hurt you.. I promise" He whispers to me.
I nod and slowly open my legs. His eyes slowly rake over my body. "God you're so fucking beautiful" He whispers to me. He leans down and kisses me so softly, like he's scared to brake me all of a sudden.
This side of Seth is something so new to me. This egotistical, all about himself guy turns out to be the most passionate, loving guy that I know..
He presses his waist into mine and I can feel how hard he his through his boxers.
It makes me moan and I cling to him as he starts to gr^nd against me.
I softly moan his name into his ear and then my head rolls back.
A loud moan escapes as I feel his fingers connect with my core.
His grinding stopped and all I feel now is his gentle touch, r^bbing and moving against my core in a slow motion.
This.. This feeling isn't like it was before..
Its so much more now and it feels like electricity is running through my body.
My hand runs through my hair and the other grips my pillow.
"God Shea you're so w^t" He whisper as he pulls me to the edge of the bed. He gets on his knees in front of my bare core and my body trembles as I feel his tongue run along my bud.
My back instantly arches and my hands grip the sheets tightly.
His mouth passionately licks, sucks, an kisses my core, making my whole body just tremble with so much pleasure.
My hands grip at Seths hair and I tug on it.
He groans and moans against my core and my face is covered in such a permanent blush.
He slowly stands up and pulls off his boxers as he slowly leans over me.
I blush like crazy as I see his size.
"B-Baby will it fit..?" I whisper as I look into his beautiful eyes.
"Of course" He whispers as he runs his t^p along my f^lds. "Are you ready?" He whispers as he lays his forehead softly on mine.
"Im ready" I whisper, as I softly kiss his lips.
He slowly starts to push himself inside of me, going in a little and then pulling out, so he doesn't hurt me.
I wince loudly and cling to him as he pushes himself all the way in. "Ow fuck" I curse through a wince.
"It'll get better, I promise" He whispers to me as he slowly starts to thrust his hips back and forth slowly.
My nails grip at his back from the pain, and my head is in the crook of his neck.
A moan escapes as it starts to get better and just hearing his moans of pleasure makes it even better.
