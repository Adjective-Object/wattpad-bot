"Woah! I can't believe we survived the 4 hour delay" i said with a chuckle, mocking Sonnie because she complained for about an hour of the time. Then I realized Sonnie was asleep so I poured the rest of the water I had on her to wake her up, and believe me, it worked. My heart started rushing as they called our plane number. Once we got on the plane I talked the life out of Sonnie telling her how magical it will be when we finally meet him and how his smile will light up the room and how I will get the hug of a life time, I went on and on for about an hour and my fangirling put Sonnie to sleep, I couldn't sleep at all knowing that in a matter of days I will be able be able to meet the one and only Trevor Douglas with my best friend! Half an hour later I see Sonnie waking up, letting out a huge yawn. The flight attendants start passing out food for us to get. Sonnie and I got a few biscuits and a sprite. She asked if I got any sleep and I told her no she gave me a look like I was crazy... It's not my fault she's always tired. I was so excited I shouted "ONE MORE HOUR TILL ONE WEEK OF PARADISE!!!" Everyone told me to shush... I felt no shame and Sonnie just giggled. Waiting and waiting as the minutes pass by I sit and think..
