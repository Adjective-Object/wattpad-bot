"Here we are, 232. Hopefully you have at least one class with Zach." She waved at me as she walked off. I smiled as I waited for the bell to ring
*******Time skip to end of science*******
I pulled my hair back out of my face as I walked into the hallway. As I walked into the hallway to my locker, I saw a crowd of boys in a circle. Curious, I went over to the crowd. As I went up, I could hear people talking.
"Where did you get that on your face, Zach?"
"Yeah, what girl did you break up with this time?"
"She was pretty mad by the look of it."
They were circling Zach! I've gotta stop this!
I pushed through the growing crowd with suprising strength and finally got to the middle of it to find a flushed looking Zach. "What is going on?!" I asked, facing all the boys nearest to me and Zach. "And who might you be?" One boy asked me defiantly. "I am the girl that slapped him, why should YOU care, buffy?" I said confidently. I will not back down, not in front of all these boys.
"Ooooohhhh."
"I barely even know him. I have to live with him because I have no parents. I just came to this school, and I slapped him for a reason, unlike the girls he's dated." I told them. "Oh yeah? What is that reason, then?" Another guy said. "Is that any of your business? I think not." I told him.
"Slap me, then. Prove that you were the one that slapped Giant over there." He said, pointing to Zach.
I clenched and unclenched my fists, facing the guy.
But then, I heard a voice that made me turn around.
"Leena?!"
I widened my eyes. That familiar short black hair, those chocolate brown eyes, I was sure it was him.
I gasped. "James?!"

Anywho, I am SOOOOOOO sorry for not updating! I have SO much procrastination!
Keep being sarcastic and eating muffins!
