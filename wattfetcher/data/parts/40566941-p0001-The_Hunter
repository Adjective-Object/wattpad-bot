I'm running. I'm running as fast as I can. My legs burn but I still carry on running and running. But the thing is I don't know what I am running from. A bear? A monster? All I know is its fast and it's after me. Finally when the monster or beast gets to me I see its face its not a bear or a monster it's a wolf. This wolf is not ordinary it has pure blue eyes but has dark fur. It's also bigger than the normal wolf because I've seen wolfs before. This wolf is huge. It's nothing I've ever seen. Then when I look away I see a boy about my age that resembles the wolf that I saw a couple of seconds ago. This boy has brown hair the the lightest baby blue eyes I have ever seen in my life they were beautiful. "Who are you?" I asked. "I don't know who are you?" He said. "Well I don't know who I am." I replied.
