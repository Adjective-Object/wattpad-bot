I followed Maylee and Harry down the corridor and to McGonagall's office. Wait, no, we aren't at her office. We're at a classroom. Why are we at a classroom? Harry looked at me and quirked his eyebrows. I shrugged and turned to Maylee. She looked at me and mouthed, "What's going on?" I shook my head. McGonagall came out with a young guy, maybe in his fifth or sixth or seventh year, smiling at us.
"Domino! Are you gonna keep up commentating?" He asked.
"Yup. Totally." I smiled. Was this all that it was about? Quidditch? McGongall saw... I gasped, she saw Harry and Maylee passing the rememberall around! They're not in trouble, they're being recruited!
"And these are the two mater flyers? I'm Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team, nice to meet both of you. And your names?"
"Harry Potter." Harry said, giving him a stunned smile.
"I'm Maylee Black!" May said, beaming up at Wood.
"Awesome." Wood said, smiling.
"I think the boy could be an excellent seeker. He's small and quick, and was very good at catching... Well, whatever they were playing with. And the girl. She caught the ball from miles away, and sill managed to fly down one-handed." McGonagall said, smiling.
"I'm impressed. Say, you two come to the courtyard tomorrow evening, I'll see what you can do. Oh, and you'd better come as well, Domino." Wood smiled. "You probably need to freshen up, and watching these guys play would be good for you."
"Okay." I smiled happily next to Maylee and Harry.
"Now, Wood, you'd better get back to class. The same goes for you three." McGonagall smiled at us. We said a quick thank-you and Maylee did a cartwheel in the hallway, which McGonagall saw and said, "I saw that, Ms. Black. I'm giving you a warning, I know you're happy." Harry laughed his butt off, and gave me a piggy back ride back to the courtyard as May ran in front of us as if she were leading an army.
