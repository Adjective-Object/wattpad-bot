I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath scared to rock the boat and make a mess so I sat quietly, agreed politely, I guess that I forgot I had a choice let you push me past the breaking point, I stood of nothing so I fell for everything,
you helped me down but I got up, hey already brushin of the dust,hear my voice. you hear that sound?like thunder gonna shake the ground, you helped me down but I got up hey get ready cause I've had enough, I see it all I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger the fire dacin through the fire cause I am the campion and you're gonna hear me roar louder, louder than lion cause I am the campion and you're gonna hear me roar, you're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floatin like a butterfly stinging like a bee I've earned my stripes I went from zero to my own hero you helped me down but I got up hey already brushin off the dust you hear my voice you hear that sound like thunder gonna shake the ground
you helped me down but I got up hey get ready cause I've had enough I see it all I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger the fire dancin through the fire cause I am the champion and you're gonna hear me roar louder louder than the lion cause I am the champion and you're gonna hear me roar, you'll hear me roar,youre gonna hear me roar, roar roar roar roar roar I got the eye of the tiger, fire, dancin through the fire cause I am the champion and you're gonna hear me roar, roar louder, louder than the lion cause I am the champion and you're gonna hear me roar,
yeah, you're gonna hear me roar,youll hear me roar, you're gonna hear me roar
