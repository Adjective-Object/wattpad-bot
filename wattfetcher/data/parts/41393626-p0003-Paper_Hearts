My heart was still throbbing in my ears as I panted. You are so weak, I scolded. Poor me. Poor him too, his first impression of this good academic school was an socially awkward teenager pinning him to the ground, painfully I might add, with her face shoved into his ( incredibly attractive) one. Now I thought about it, his was kind of like those sappy cheesy movies. Maybe I had a chance? Shut up Julia! This was reality not some Hawaiian day dream. But inside, I felt all warm and cheerful. As I continued to run away(I had stopped my getaway to daydream) I was scarcely aware that many meters or so behind me, a pair of beautiful cinnamon diamonds were staring at me as I fled from the scene, my plait unravelling and billowing out behind me In the wind. Yep. I had definitely caught his eye.
