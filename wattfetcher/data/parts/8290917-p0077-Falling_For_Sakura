"But-"
"It was better to leave you in peace than to make things worse," he said. "Sorry we forgot all about you."
"So you did forget about me, eh?" She confirmed, nodding her head.
"Yes," he said. "I admit that. But now we're making it up to you. How about that?"
"A bit too late for that now," she said. "And I'm totally not interested. When the wedding is over, I'm gone."
She shut up immediately and blushed.
Sebastian frowned. "Gone? Where are you going?"
She changed the subject. "Let's go home. I'm sure everyone is worried."
He wouldn't have it. "Where are you planning to go?"
"It's none of your business, Sebastian," she said and unconsciously played with the pendant of her necklace, nervous all of a sudden.
Sebastian noticed. "Do they know about this? Mom and Dad?" he asked suspiciously.
"I haven't told them yet," she muttered. "I will later."
"I suppose you're old enough to go wherever you want," he said finally, disappointed, his heart beating painfully.
"Yes, I am old enough to go wherever I want and do whatever I want," she said. "And now I want to go home." She finally removed her hand from the pendant to put on her helmet.
Sebastian had a good look at the pendant. It was beautiful, in the shape of the cherry blossom flower. Hadn't she always been wearing that, since she was a child? It must have meant something to her, and he decided he'd find out later.
