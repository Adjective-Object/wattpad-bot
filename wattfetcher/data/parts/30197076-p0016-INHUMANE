"Yes ?" She Answered, Her Head Tilting Slightly To Meet His Knowing Gaze.
He Passed Her The Sheet Of Paper, Plaing It On Her Lap Before Offering Her A Pencil.
She Stared At His Hand For Quite Sometime, A Frown On Her Face.
Her Hand Reached Up From Her Lap, Her Fingers Wrapping Around The Peice Of Wood Before Looking Up At The Doctor Confusingly.
"Dont Be Confused, I Just Want You To Write Down What Do You Think About Me ? I want You To Write Down Your Thoughts About Me..Briefly." He Explained, His Hands Gesturing Towards The Piece Of Paper On Her Lap.
She Took A Sharp Intake Of Breath, her Widened For a Brief Of a Second As She Wrapped The Doctor's Words Around Her Head.
Dr.Vincent Seemed To Take Notice Of The Slight Trembling Of Her Fingers As He Wondered What Exactly Did She Fear ?
Gripping The Pen Tightly Between Her fingers, Her Eyes Shut Tightly As She Seemed To Battle With Her Mind About A matter.
A Few Moments Passed Before She Snapped Them Open And As If Rage Had Taken Over Her, She Started Writing Non-Stop.
The Light Scratching Of The Pencil Sliced Through The Silent Atmosphere, As The Doctor Sat There, Taking Notice Of Her Every Little Movement.
She Gripped Onto The Pencil More Firmly, Digging Into The Paper, The Golden Specks Around The Pupil Of Her Eyes Slowly Taking Over.
Rage Was Taking Over.
She Almost Seemed Possessed By whatever She Was Writing. More Like Her Life Depended On This.
Engulfed In Her Own World, Her Hand Gripped The Pencil More Firmly And Tighter As It Dug Through The Paper Futher. All The While, She Never Stopped Writing Until A SNAP Echoed The The Room Snapping Her From Her Daze.
In A Flash, Her Eyes Had Adverted Back To Their Coffee, Woodzy Colour As She Widened Her Eyes At The Pencil.
Directing Her Gaze Up To The Doctor, Her Face Engulfed in Terror And Guilt.
"I-I..It Br-" she Stuttered, But Got Cut Off By The Doctor Gently.
"It's Okay Brianna, You've Wrote Enough." He Smiled Gently, Tugging At The Paper Infront Of Her.
He Folded It Into Two Before Putting It Away Hastily In his Jenas Pocket.
"Aren't you Going To Read it ?" She Asked In Hesitation.
"No." He Retorted, "I Think I've Seen Enough." He Breathed Out.
All The While, She Hadnt Risked To Spare Him A Glance As She Sat, Staring At Her Hands Blankly.
He Placed A Gentle Hand On her Shoulder, a Gentle Smile Curved On His Lips Before He Asked Her Lowly.
"Brianna, Do You Trust me ?"
She Snapped Her gaze Up To Meet His Sympathetic eys, Before They Darted Anywhere Else Across The Room.
Inhaling a Deep Breath, She Whispered Slowly,
"No."
A Frown Curved itself On His Face, Confusion clearly Evident In His Tone..
"Then Why Did You Tell Me Any Of This ?"
Staring Straight into His Confused Eyes, Gulping Nervously, She Uttered The Words That She Never Thought Would Come out Of Brianna Vadore's Mouth, Ever.
"Because She Told Me To."
