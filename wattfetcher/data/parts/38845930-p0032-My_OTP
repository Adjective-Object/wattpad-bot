Jordan's POV
Erin lied down with Boo and I knelt down by the bed too small for more than two people.
Erin could only lay or her left side because she broke her right arm, so I sat on the side she could see me from.
"I love you." She mouthed. I mouthed the same thing back.
By the time Boo was asleep, Erin and I had told eachother we love each other probably around 30 times.
"I love you." I said after we snuck out of Boo's room.
"I love you." She said back.
"I love you." I said again.
"I... love you." She said. We were just standing there outside he daughters room saying "I love you" to each other repeatedly. Finally she kissed me and I kissed her. We stumbled into her bedroom, kissing the entire time. I kicked off my shoes and she kicked of hers. We went to the bed and just sat there kissing for what felt like forever even though only a few minutes had passed.
"Jordan, stop." She said.
"What? Why?" I said.
She kissed me again.
"I'm sorry. I... needed a... break and to... to say I... love you." She said in between breaths.
I kissed her and leaned back on the bed pushing her down underneath me.
"I love you." I said.
"Jordan." She said as she pulled away from the kiss.
"Sorry I -- "
"No, it's -- your fine, I just don't want to --  " She cut me off to say while raising her hands.
"Oh, Umm... yeah, let's not do that." I said.
"I'm sorry." She said standing up looking at the floor.
No, I am. I would have initiated it." I said while hugging her from behind.
"I just don't want to make any mistakes." She said as I felt a tear fall on my hand.
"Don't -- it's alright, we're not gonna make a mistake." I said.
"Just, please don't let me make a mistake." She said walking away from me and out the bedroom door.
"We're not gonna make a mistake, no mistakes have been made nor will they." I said following her out into the hall.
"Please don't let me make a mistake."
