We finally have everything unpack and in order in tbe new house. The new house is gorgeous. Cam is pushing my last nerve, hes being so bossy i cant stand it.
We were all sitting in the living room and Cam and Nash were still working around the house. There like the parents of the family.
"ISABELLA FAITH DALLAS HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO PUT UR SHIT AWAY IN THE CLOSET" Cameron yelled "AS MANY TIMES U CAN UNTIL I DO IT" I yelled back at him. "DO NOT SASS ME" He yelled
"UGH JUST SHUT UP UR SO ANNOYING" I yelled. "ISABELLA DO NOT TELL ME TO SHUT UP YOU UNDERSTAND ME" He yelled getting angry.
All the boys were just shocket at how angry Cam was. "UR NOT MY DAD" I yelled at him. "YA DAMN RIGHT IM NOT GO UP TO YOUR ROOM NOW" He screamed. "I HATE YOU I WANT MOM AND DAD BACK" I yelled and ran up to my room crying.
"Bella wait" Cam said. "Dude what the fuck" Nash said chasing Bella up the stairs. "Cam u need to calm the fuck down" Matt said. "Shes only 13" Carter said. "IM DONE" Cam said getting up and walking out the door.
I heard a knock on my door. "Bell, Its Nash" He said. "Just go away" i said. "No Bella open up" he said "Nash leave" i said. "Dude i got her" I heard Hayes's voice. "Babe its Hayes can i come in im alone" He said. "Fine" Isaid.
Hayes walked over to me and held me in his arms and i just cried. "I hate him" I said hyserical crying. "No you dont Bella" He said holding me tighter. "Why would he scream at me like that" I said. "You know that he has a lot of stress right now Bell he just needs to cool off" He said. "I miss my mom&dad i wish they were still here" I said teary eyed. "I know Bella" Hayes hugged me again and kissed my cheek. He cuddled next to me and I fell asleep in his chest.
*MATTS POV*
I chased after Cam when he ran outthe door. Theres something up with him he would never flip like that on Bella. Cam hopped i to his car so i got inti mine and i followed him to a beach.
"CAMERON WAIT" I yelled. Cam was sobbing at this point, tears were rushing outof his eyes.
"Cam whats wrong" i said hugging him and lettung him cry on my shoulder.
"IM SUCH A FUCK UP" he yelled sobbing. "Cam what do you mean" I said rubbing his back. "I cant do it, I cant raise Bella, Im gunna be such a terrible dad, She deserves so much better, My parents must think im such a disappointment" He sobbed.
"Cameron Alexander Dallas you are not a fuck up, your such an amazing person for Bella to live with, Your going to have a hard time raising a 13 year old girl while your only 22 years old. But thats why all of us guys are here to help you, Your parents are beyond proud of you because you are raising Bella and your an amazing role model for her, your the perfect person for her to be with" I said.
"Matt I love you brother" Cam said. "I need to go talk to Bella" Cam saod getting up.
"Yo bro im just saying Bella might not wanna talk she wouldnt even let Nash im, she finally let Hayes in" I warned him
"Fuck" Cam sighed and started driving
