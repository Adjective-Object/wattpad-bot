My friend:Â  I want to high five her.... in the face...With a brick. Covered in spikes, dipped in poison.
Me: She can go swimming in acid... in a straight jacket.
My friend: She can choke on her own puke....
Me:.... SHE CAN GO AND STEP ON A LEGO!!!
My friend:.... that's just plain mean....
Me: well, what can I say?
