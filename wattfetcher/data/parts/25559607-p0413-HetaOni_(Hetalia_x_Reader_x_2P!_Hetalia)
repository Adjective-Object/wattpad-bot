"I....what...I don't understand...Vodka..?" she said, feeling both fallen and confused.
Smiling, Past Nikolai replied, "You're nice to have and always welcome in my eyes."
"Idiot...you can...still say things like that at a time like this..?" Past (Name) said, her lips slightly curling upwards, but her eyes watering at the same time.
Rolling his eyes, Past Zao spoke, "...Aiyah. I...I don't know about you guys...but I...need to...rest my eyes now..."
"What? Wait, Zao, no-don't!...." the girl cried out.
Looking at her from the corner of his eyes, Past Zao gave a small smile. "It's alright...Meeting you was more than what we all had deserved, so I think our time here was more than enough."
"Zao..." she tried stepping closer to them, but Past Nikolai slowly raised a hand. "There's not much time anymore.....please, go...the both of you..." he said.
"Ragazza...he's right..." Past Luciano said. Looking at their two fallen comrades, the Italian nodded his head in acknowledgement of them, to which the two had reciprocated. Past (Name) clenched her fist and exited the room together with Past Luciano.

Their surroundings changed into the Library of the third floor. This time there were more people in the same room. But, just like the previous ones...the people were all critically injured and bloodied.

"Don't...worry about us, poppet. Just leave this awful place before that...bad monster comes after you..." Past Oliver told the girl, his voice cracking slightly.
"But...Ollie..." Past (Name) tried to speak, but she felt like she couldn't finish after seeing everyone's condition. Past Francois, Past Allen, and Past Matthieu were leaning against the bookshelves, their bodies covered with blood all over. ...And none of them moved...at all.
Tears streamed down the girl's cheeks as she held her friend's hand. "Ollie...we can't-we can't just leave you guys here! There's got to be some way to fix all this....You..you have magic, right? Maybe you can-"
"Hush now, poppet. Don't cry..." he said. He gave a small smile, then sighed. "I'm sorry, (Second Name)...but...I don't have any strength left, much less magic. Besides, I'll be fine here, the boys might get upset if they found out I left...."
