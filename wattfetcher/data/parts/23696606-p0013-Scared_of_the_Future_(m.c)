Lilith's pov I awoke when my phone went off, the familiar melody of my ringtone echoing through the living room. I sat up straight and stretched before sighing and reaching for my phone. I didn't even bother to check the caller ID before answering. "Hello?" I said lazily as I rubbed my eyes with my free hand. "Heey, It's Calum!" I stopped rubbing and put my hand down on my thighs. "Um, hi, Calum, what's up?"I looked at the clock on the wall, and felt like I had forgotten something. "Ehm... well, I've been waiting for you to call... you said you would..." I slapped myself in my forehead. "Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I was totally going to, I promise! I just fell asleep really late last night and I didn't set my alarm. Fuck I'm so stupid!"
I fell back into the couch and looked up at the ceiling. "Oh, no worries! I just thought you'd forgotten about me." Calum laughed at the other line, making me smile a little. "Is there any way I could make it up to you?" I bit my lip after asking. "Well, you could always buy me a coffee at that cafe we met at?" He suggested teasingly. "Yeah," I laughed. "I think that's fair. Lets say I meet you there at 3?" "Sounds like a plan! See you then! Bye," he said before hanging up. I locked my phone and placed it on my chest. I closed my eyes and giggled. Maybe there was some light in this dark tunnel after all?
I got up from the couch and walked into my bedroom. I changed into better clothes and went to the kitchen. I had just started making coffee, when I heard a knock on my door. I walked over to the door, looking through the peephole. There was no one there. Sighing, I turned to walk back to the kitchen, when there was another knock. I groaned and opened the door quickly, hoping to catch the "knock-a-door-runner" in the act. "Look, I know you think this is funny, but-" I cut myself off mid sentence when I saw who it was.
"Hi Lilith" Michael said awkwardly. I leaned on the door, looking at him. "Michael" I said simply.  "Aw, don't be like that!" Michael complained. "Be like what?" I asked, trying to sound oblivious about my mood. "You're being all cold and stuff! Look, I came to say that I'm sorry about last night. I couldn't explain it." He scratched his head and shrugged. "Explain now" I said, crossing my arms over my chest. "May I come in then?" Michael asked, biting his lip. I stepped aside and walked back into the kitchen, where the coffee was now done. I heard the door shut and ruffling of shoes. soon enough Michael was in the kitchen with me as well.
He sat down on the barstool by the kitchen island and looked around. I poured the coffee into two mugs and put one of them in front of Michael. I sat down on the stool opposite of him before saying: "Go on, explain." Michael sighed as he looked me in the eye. "Promise me you'll listen carefully to what I say with an open mind?" He asked with a slightly sad look on his face. I nodded slowly, unsure of what he meant. He sighed again before smiling. "I promise I'm not crazy or anything." He chuckled before taking his mug in his hands and turning serious.
"Have you ever heard of archangels?" I bit my lip and nodded. "From the bible, right? There's Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Camael,  Jerahmeel, Lucifer and-" "And Michael" Michael interrupted me with a smile. "Yeah," I said smiling back. "But what does angels have to do with any of this?" I asked as I raised my mug to my lips. "Well... You see," he trailed off, looking down at his mug before laughing and looking up again. "It's real. They're all real." My eyes widened at his words. "And..." he said sighing. "I'm one of them."
I fell in a trance and felt my body go numb. I was gone until I heard the sound of ceramic breaking, and realized I had dropped my mug. I blinked several times and looked down at the mess before looking up at Michael. "You're kidding, right? Angels aren't real! They can't be!" I rubbed my face  trying to process what Michael just said. He exhaled before standing up. "Come with me" I got up from my chair and followed him into the living room. When we got there, Michael started closing the blinds on one side of the room. "What are you doing?" I asked, but got no response. I ran over to one of the open windows. "What the hell?" I whispered. The weather had changed. 15 minutes ago, it was sunny and there was no skies in sight. But now, it was dark, rainy and there was thunder and lightning.
"What is going on?" I asked in a more demanding tone this time, hoping that Michael would answer this time.  He finished closing the blinds and walked over to me. "I suppose you want some kind of proof, am I right? Now, go stand over by the TV."  I nodded and did as he said. He stood with his back facing the open window and with his front facing me. Before I could ask anymore questions, there was a lightning outside, and it lit up the room. As it did, a dark shadow, resembling wings, spread from Michael's back and on the walls. "Wha-" was all I could say before I felt my head get dizzy. I felt myself falling and before I knew it I had blacked out.
