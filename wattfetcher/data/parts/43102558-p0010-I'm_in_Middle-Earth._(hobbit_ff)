"Michelle, they left you. Get up." Bilbo's voice woke me up.
My eyes fluttered open. I looked around. The dwarves and my siblings were gone. I shot up and grabbed my bag of clothes. I ran to a room and quickly got dressed in some shorts and a t-shirt. I grabbed my bow, quiver, and throwing knives belt and equipped them. "Bilbo are you coming or not?" I asked as I reached the door. Bilbo paused then signed his contract. We raced out the door. Bilbo yell something to a hobbit about us being late for an adventure. I led the way to the wilderness.
We ran until I stopped. I heard the sound of ponies walking near by. "You take the ground and I'll take the trees. We will surprise them. All you have to do is run up to them saying that you signed the contract. I will jump down and surprise them." I planned. Bilbo nodded in agreement. I climbed the tree close to me. Bilbo started running. I leaped from tree to tree following after Bilbo. I beat him to the company
"Wait! I signed it! I signed the contract!" Bilbo yelled as he got to them and then he handed it to Balin.
"Welcome to the company of Thorin Oakenshield, Mr. Baggins. Where is Michelle?" Balin wondered.
All of the dwarves had sad faces. I befriended all of them except for Thorin when I first met them. Bilbo gave me a signal. I jumped out of the tree and landed in front of the company. Everyone looked at me in surprise.
"I appreciate you concern. It was Thorin who left me instead of waking me. You can't keep me from coming. I know where you are going to stop at and everything. I am your seer after all yet you take my siblings." I smirked.
"It was my idea to leave you and take your siblings. I knew that you would be the only one who could persuade Bilbo to join us." Gandalf stepped in.
"Don't do that again unless you want an arrow in your head, Mithrandir." I threatened him.
"Get them both a pony." Thorin ordered.
"I don't need a pony. I can walk." I said.
"Just get on a pony. I don't want to agrue with you." Thorin sighed.
"I don't want nor need a pony. I have walked very long distances with you. You know that I can walk."
"Just get on a pony."
"No. I can do this all day. I'm just as stubborn as you."
"Fine, I'll make you get on a pony."
"What do you me-AN?!" I asked as Thorin rode up to me and lifted me on his horse.
"Continue." Thorin ordered.
"I will win one of our arguments." I whispered in Thorin's ear as I wrapped my arms around him.
"We'll see." Thorin smirked.
"I'll ride with Fili next."
"No you won't. You are to ride with me."
"I'm not your property. I can ride with who I wish."
"Then how will I protect the seer."
"I don't need protection. After all, you said it yourself. I'm a great fighter."
"Yes I did, but you haven't fought before. That is what you said."
"Because it is true. Fighting just comes natural to me."
"We will see."
"Stop saying that."
I rested my head on his back. I noticed Fili glaring at Thorin. I chuckled. "Your eldest nephew really hates you. He wants me to ride with him." I smiled. Thorin even chuckled. It swelled my heart to hear him chuckling. Yet it also hurt that I wasn't with Fili. Why do I love them both? I sighed.
