"Someone go get some water or something." I said, "It'll be a nice wake up."
"I got it!" Phil said and ran back to our bus. Less than ten minutes and he was back with a bucket of water.
"We're going to dump it on them on three got it?" Mike said grinning.
"One, two, three!"
The guys threw the water on the two and they both sat straight up, Kellin let out a little shriek as VIc glared at us.
"Its time to wake up!" I shouted, "We leave in ten minutes love birds!"
"Fuck you." Vic said and looked around, "What's that smell?"
"You."
He frowned and looked down at himself then at Kellin. "Oh fuck."
"You two got wasted last night." Mike said, "Kellin we told you one drink for him and this is what you do!?"
"Well you see what happened was..." Kellin trailed off nervously.
"Yeah, we know just get up and go get dressed or whatever."
Kellin stood up and looked down at himself in disgust, "Do you remember what even happened?" He asked Vic who shook his head no.
"We'll explain it later then." Jaime said, "Just go you both smell gross."
"I'd even say worse than Jaime's feet." Tony said.
"I think that's the nicest thing you've said to me Tone." He said smiling, "But my feet don't stink at all you little ass."
"Yeah they do."
"Whatever. Just you two go now."
"Alright, I call the shower first." Kellin said and left to go to the buses.
"So what all happened?" Vic asked, "I kinda blanked out after the fifth drink."
"You two like hard core made out last night, stripped down, had a food fight and passed out." I told him, "It was something."
"We made out?" He asked his eyes widening, "Why didn't someone stop me?"
"I think we all saw it coming one way or another."
"No! It wouldn't have happened." He said, "I don't like him like that! I'm just now starting to tolerate him without feeling awkward!"
"Don't say that, it would have happened and we all know it." I said.
"Yeah it was, we told you." Mike said.
"No. I don't like him like that. Besides it's too soon." He said stubbornly.
"That means there's a chance! Too soon means he's been thinking about it!"
"No it doesn't. It means that it's too soon for me to like him when I'm still not fully over Cara."
"Come on, she's a bitch, she cheated. You shouldn't still be thinking about her."
"I was with her for almost two years, I can't help but to think about her!"
"I guess, just go shower, Kellin's probably done by now."
"Whatever," He muttered and got up.
"Maybe you'll get to see him naked!" I called after him.
"Fuck you!"
I laughed, "Man they're gonna be together by the end of tour."
"Yup." Mike said, "Especially if I have anything to do with it."
