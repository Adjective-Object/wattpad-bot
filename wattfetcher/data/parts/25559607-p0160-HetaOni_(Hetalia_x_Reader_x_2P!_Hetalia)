"They weren't just hypothetical...All those things I saw... were past experiences, or the future...?" America began concluding.
I saw that (Name)-chan fidgeted in her place. It seems she knows.
America noticed her and faced the girl. "Wait. Then, what number is this world? How many times have we... lost our friends?"
It is not easy to answer such a question like that. By the way she's acting, she's probably having a hard time thinking what could be the best way to tell us or explain to us that without us getting hurt...by the truth.
She looked at America with unsure eyes and spoke, "......W-Well--"
"--What number? ... What? We?" Canada became confused from listening in on us.
Russia creased his forehead. "You mean, how many times have we come here?"
"....Ugh..." (Name)-chan groaned, clutching her head and sounding like she was in pain or as if she was sick.
"L-Love, are you all right?!" he asked the girl and turned to America and I. "Just what the hell did you guys see?! Can you go back once more?"
America shook his head and looked away. "Can't you... do that for me? I don't feel so good, either..."
"I'm sorry. Even though I know he's all right,I want to see Italy as soon as possible..."

I told them.
Canada went beside (Name)-chan and spoke, "(N-Name), can you still walk? Wait, nevermind. I'll just carry you."
"N-No, you...you don't...need to do that..." (Name)-chan croaked out.
The Canadian creased his forehead. Not taking the girl's answer, he said, "I want to. I can." At that, he carried the (Name)-chan in his arms and continued, "I'm already doing it."
"Canada..." she protested.
He shook his head. "Seriously, the people here always put themselves last. You need to take care of yourselves a little more. If you won't do that, I will." he told her with a concerned expression.
"...........I'm sorry...." she apologised before falling asleep in the Canadian's arms. Her way of saying sorry had a tone that was quite different, though I can't put what it is.

Not in my state right now. I feel like my knees are going to give in.
"You look... unsteady on your feet. Here, climb on my back." Russia kindly offered me. I took his offer because I could no longer handle it anymore.

I only saw a few pasts and yet I feel like I'm going to fall apart... If I don't tell them, I won't be able to stand it.
I can't keep this bottled up, or I'll go...
