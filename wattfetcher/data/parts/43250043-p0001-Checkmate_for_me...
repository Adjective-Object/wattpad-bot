Dear  Kathy,Your're probably trying to recognize and remember who used to nickname you that cheesy name,and when you actually do,there will be enough clues in this letter to make you sure enough about who's that anonymous gal that decided to send this letter.But anyway, a clue ,because you're my fav ,I was real close to you.And I'm really sorry.For everything.For all the trouble I've caused you.For all those days where I've kept you up ,crying on your shoulders,until you'd have to excuse yourself to change your sponge-wet shirt,so I could have a dry shirt to dingle my tears on. I'm also sorry for leaving without saying goodbye,knowing that I probably wont see you again.But I had to,you know? I had to run off to somewhere,for the sake of relaxing,relaxing my troubled mind from every awful thing that was after me. But you know? It was a good decision,apart from leaving you,the only good thing in my life, behind.I mean , It was a good feeling. But the sad thing is,I'd have to go out and face the world.I can't just stay away and avoid  everybody ,you know? At some point,I'd have to interact.And I know that committing suicide isn't an answer.It means you just surrender to everyone,and then,it means they win.And I grew up to not be that person,to give up to people. You're probably wanting to tell me that I ran away,like literally,not metaphorically. But I reply,telling you that no,its not that way.Anyway,Kath,I am really willing to reunite with you,but I'm afraid.I'm afraid you'd do just the wrong thing in order to help me.But I don't ever want to see those werewolves again.Ever. And I can't tell you where I'm staying,or who I'm staying with. But I do hope to meet you as a coincidence one day,and then we'd have our regular gossip .I miss you ,Katherine. A lot.With Love ,
