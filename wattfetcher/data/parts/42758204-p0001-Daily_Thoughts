The world around us is filled with so much distraction, from phones, to music, to games. With so much it's hard to focus on one thing. Now in certain aspects this is a good thing. People need not search too far to find something to take their mind off the stress pain and emptiness the world thrusts upon them. It is not difficult to find meaning in and give meaning to meaningless things in order to fill the void left by the absence of deep though, meaningful conversation, passion, curiosity, and or focus. However it is because of distraction and meaningless things that this void lives and in some instances grows. Now not everyone is effected this way, I know that, but I cannot be the only one. For those of us effected in such a way as described, how can we fill the void? Perhaps someday we'll find someone to teach us. Perhaps someday we will gain what has been lost.
