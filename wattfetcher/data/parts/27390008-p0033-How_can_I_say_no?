"I think you know the answer to that. I'm pretty sure you can hear it." Johnny whispered. I raised my head off his chest and gazed up at him. Johnny had a sad yet loving expression on his face.

"Hear what?" I asked. Johnny smiled and kissed my cheek.

"I think you know." He said. I shook my head and grinned playfully at him. I did know. But I wanted him to tell me. "You probably could hear my heart pounding in my chest. That is all for you babe." Those were the words I wanted to hear. I leaned up and kissed him.

"I love you. You are just way too cute for your own good." I whispered when I pulled away. Johnny smirked and I felt my cheeks heat up.

"I love you too. Wanna know something?" Johnny asked. I nodded. "Now I mean every word of this."

"I believe you." I said as I laid my head back down on his chest. His heartbeat filled my ears once again. It was followed by his voice.

"I'm an old fashioned guy....I want to be an old man with a beer belly sitting on a porch, looking at a lake or something. And I wanna do it with you. Together. I wanna marry you one day and have kids and watch them grow up and have grand kids and all that and I wanna grow old with you. I wanna look out at that lake with you. Sure I've had other girlfriends, but I've never wanted them to be the one I'd do that with. You're different. You're the one. I just know it. You're the one." Johnny said. I giggled at the image of us together that way. I admit, I wanted it too.

"That's sounds perfect Johnny. I wanna be there with you too. You're mine and I'll never forget it for as long as I live." I whispered. I fell asleep to the beat of Johnny's heart and him telling me all about how well will have a cabin on a lake and have bunches of grandchildren running around while we watched and how no matter what we'd still be together. Through all of this, right before my mind lost all conscience thought, I couldn't help but think: it's just Johnny being Johnny. And I loved that about him.
