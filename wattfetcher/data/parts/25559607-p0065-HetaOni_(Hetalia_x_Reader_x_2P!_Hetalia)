"Oh, I want to take a look around, too. Can I tag along with you, Japan?" I asked him.
"Of course, _____-chan." He replied.
Japan turned to the others. "Well, we'll go and look around. We'll see you later."
"I'm coming with you, too!" Italy said.
Japan shook his head and spoke, "No, we'll be fine.We'll just look around and we'll be right back. Canada, England, we'll lecture him on your behalf."
"Give him a good earful." Canada said as he crossed his arms.
"No, wait. I'm coming with you. There's something that has been bothering me." England told Japan.
"Er, but..." Japan tried to protest.
"It's just something I want to check out. Please." England pleaded.
"I see. You may come along, then. We'll be back in about 15 minutes. See you later." Japan said to the others as we left the room.
Italy gave an upset look and spoke softly. "Japan..."
=================
The four of us walked through the hallway until we entered another room. It was pretty small, with shelves filled with various books.
England stopped and scanned the room, as if searching for something there. "There's something about this room that is bothering me."
I turned to him and asked, "Hmm? What is it, England?"
"No...I'm not sure yet...I guess I'll check it out later." He replied.
"Very well. Now, let's hurry." Japan said as he motioned us to proceed walking.
=================
We passed by some rooms until we entered through a door that led us to a dark place that had walls that looked jagged and dusty. Good thing I had a flashlight with me. I handed it over to Japan as he led us through the unknown hallway.
As I was walking, I accidentally stepped on my shoelace and almost tripped. Good thing America reacted fast enough and caught me.
"Whoa, dudette! Gotta be careful." America chuckled, giving my hand a light squeeze.
I felt my face heat up from embarassment. "Th-Thanks, hero." I told him as I took a step back and straightened my clothes.
"HAHAHAHA! No, problem!" He said in his usual tone.
"...Hero, huh?" Japan said out loud in a low voice.
"Yeah! The one and only!!~" America grinned.
England clicked his tongue. "Ugh. Don't let him get too full of himself, love." He told me whilst rolling his eyes at the American.
"Aww, c'mon Iggy! Just accept it!" America said, crossing his arms.
"You're being completely preposterous. Also, I already told you not to call me that!" The Brit snapped.
Suddenly, Japan stopped walking, making me bump into him.
"Oww..S-Sorry, Japan. Uh. Hey, why did you stop, anyway?" I asked.
He pointed the flashlight to the wall in front of us and spoke. "This rope ladder..."
All four of us looked up to where the ladder went. Ever so faintly, we saw light. It was sunlight. It led to the outside of the mansion! I remember this from the game, now! I also remember that...this ladder will prove to be useless. I let out an unnoticeable sigh. The others, on the other hand, had newfound hope in their eyes.
