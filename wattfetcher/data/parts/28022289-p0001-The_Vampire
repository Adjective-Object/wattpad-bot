It was a breezy autumn day, October 3, 1968. I fell in love with him, but I knew he would never love me. He and I were only in 9th grade. We were both 14 years old. I wish I would have known how much it affected me that very day. Something I would remember the rest of eternity.
It was lunch, and we all went outside to eat. But there was something about that day that was different. Everybody looked at me like I was different, and I am different. But it was like the world knew my secret. I was talking to a couple of my friends when he walked up to me. He was the only one who wasn't looking at me so very strangely. He said he wanted me to follow him behind the huge oak tree in the park. I've heard rumors that behind the oak tree is where couples make out. So naturally, being that 14 year old girl, I was excited. But when we were back there he stood and stared at me. We've never actually had a full conversation before, just hi's and hello's, but I had a feeling to ask him why we were back here.
"Why are we behind this tree?" I asked him. He didn't reply for a couple seconds.
"I-I need to ask you something" he said nervously. He is so cute when he stutters.
"Yes?" I reply.
"Thing is going to sound stupid" he said softly, like he didn't want to ask me.
"Please, I don't mind how stupid it sounds" I said, sounding as sweet as I possibly could, and getting excited.
"Ok. Well I've been hearing something going around the school. Well I mean I'm just casually asking... Um, are you a vampire?" Stunned, I froze and my jaw dropped, staring at him in disbelief. Then out of nowhere, before I could even answer, he pinned me to the tree and said "I knew it! And now you can't hurt anyone anymore!" Then I saw him pull out a knife. And I knew what I must do. I bit him as hard as I could, right in the neck, until he dropped limp to the ground, cold as ice.
