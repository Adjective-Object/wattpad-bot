When your legs don't work like they used to beforeAnd I can't sweep you off of your feetWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious waysMaybe just the touch of a handWell, me - I fall in love with you every single dayAnd I just wanna tell you I am
So honey nowTake me into your loving armsKiss me under the light of a thousand starsPlace your head on my beating heartI'm thinking out loudThat maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fadesAnd the crowds don't remember my nameWhen my hands don't play the strings the same wayI know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreenAnd, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memoryI'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious waysMaybe it's all part of a planWell, I'll just keep on making the same mistakesHoping that you'll understand
That, baby, nowTake me into your loving armsKiss me under the light of a thousand starsPlace your head on my beating heartThinking out loudThat maybe we found love right where we are (oh ohh)
La la la la la la la la la
So, baby, nowTake me into your loving armsKiss me under the light of a thousand starsOh, darling, place your head on my beating heartI'm thinking out loudThat maybe we found love right where we areOh, baby, we found love right where we areAnd we found love right where we are

After Cameron went home I went up to my room and took a shower. I changed into my pajamas and grabbed my diary from under my pillow.
Dear diary,So today was a pretty decent day, I mean besides Cam getting me in trouble for laughing. He's always telling these horrible pick up lines that aren't that funny but somehow I always find myself laughing. Aaliyah hit Mya in the face during dodgeball and let's just say it didn't turn out good for her. When school was over Cam came over (which is nothing new) he just makes everything better. I mean that's what's best friends are suppose to do right. Well I'm not sure but when I sing to him he looked at my eyes the whole time. Like I can't be falling for him. It would ruin our friendship. Ugh! I don't know-"I want you out of my house now" my mom screamed.Well I have to go my parents are fighting again.Sincerely,Camz
