"Do you work in here as well?"
"Not yet." Keira said trying to ease the building tension in the room.
Mr. Segura nodded before looking around.
"Why the sudden interest in our research?" Owen said getting straight to the chase.
"Well, I'm curious about how quickly you can build a dinosaur."
"Build a dinosaur?" Keira repeated through clenched teeth.

Theo held onto his mother's arm.
"Mr. Segura-"
"Please Mateo." he insisted.
"Mateo," Keira said with a stern look channeling her inner Alan Grant. " We do not build dinosaurs, these dinosaurs are genetically created in our labs and cared for until they hatch."
"Right!" Mr. Segura said. "How long does it take?"
Keira furrowed her brow. "It depends." she answered cautiously.
"But they grow up quickly, yes?"
"Yes."
"Exactly, it's amazing how quickly they grow and become massive."
"Where are you going with this?" Owen asked sternly.
"With the recent world population booming, Costa Rica is under constant demand for exports, besides coffee and sugar that we export, we do export quite a bit of meat."
The room went silent.
"After looking at the large dinosaurs out in the field, I saw exactly what the Costa Rican economy needs. Can you imagine the demand for dinosaur meat?"
