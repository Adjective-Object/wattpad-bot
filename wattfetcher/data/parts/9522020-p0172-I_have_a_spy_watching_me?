"I-I wouldn't feel comfortable having you as a servant." I said.
"But, sir. I can't not have a master. I've been cursed to be a servant for my life. If my master dies then the heir gets me, but if my master is killed than I go to the winner of the battle." He says.
I frown. Who would do such a thing to this kid?
"Oh, I'm sorry." I scratch my head as I answer him. "Also try not to call me sir or master just call me Paul. I'm only 17." I frown. I had to spend my seventeenth birthday here instead of with my mate. That sucks. I could of also had my mom there to actually see me turn 17, but noooo! I had to get kidnapped by this behemoth!
"Yes! Okay!" He says and I had a feeling he wanted to call me sir. "I can take you out of here now! I can give you clothes." He says as he inspects me.
I almost forgot... I have no clothes on.
"That'd be great." I said cringing.
He nods and runs off and I followed him. Now, I just have to find a way home... I also need to know where the hell I am. He comes back into view and drags me into a bathroom that looks nice. The water is on in the shower and he pushes me to it.
"Here s-. Here Paul. I ran your shower! I hope it's warm enough." He says.
I put my hand under it and nod.
"Thank you. Also what is your name?"
"Michael, Michael Storms." He replied.
"Thanks Mikey." I told him.
"Mikey?" He asked confused.
"It's a nickname. Do you know what that is?" I asked and he shook his head no. "Well, we'll talk about it later. Have you taken a shower?"
He shook his head confused at my question.
"My master never let me."
"That's gross." I said accidentally voicing my thoughts. "Do you know what to do in the shower?"
He nodded.
"He use to make me help him shower." He says.
I nod.
"Once I am done, I want you to take one and make sure you wash yourself well." I said knowing that I had to tell him otherwise he may not do it.
"Yes, Paul." He says. I get one leg in and point at the toilet.
"Sit there. I don't want you out of this bathroom."
He nods and moves the clothes on the counter and I get in shutting the curtain. I shower first and then tell him to get in after. I dry off and changed. I noticed the clothes were somewhat bigger than me. I grab clothes in the closet that would be huge on the kid but it'll be fine for now.
"Paul! I'm done." He told me. I come back in seeing him with a towel as he shivered.
"Do you know how to dry off?"
This time he said no. Well, looks like I have to act fatherly now. I grab the towel from him softly and tell him to spread his legs a bit. I dried him off top to bottom, even if it was uncomfortable to me. I gave him the clothes and he put them on with a red face. I raised my eyebrow.
"What's up? Why are you blushing?"
He sputtered.
"Nnnothing!"
"Mmmkay. Well we need to get money and be some food then we are going to the police station." I say then I change my mind. "Actually police station first. Can you lead the way please?"
