"Mr. Andrews, how can you claim your innocent from the murder charges of Mrs and Mr. Muphtins?" Said Miss Kingsly. Her years of being an attorney was worth the shot. In her eyes, she could see the bad sides of andrew. It was a matter of time to wait for this nut head to confess."I can prove it! Didn't I tell that I have a damn solid alibi!"He said while showing an indispicable face. Man! I hate to see that cold blooded killer's face! Her heart said. Eventhough his face looks so guilty,she still doesn't have enough evidence to prove him that his dead on guilty. Damn it!   At the corner of the jury, there was a woman. She was Mr. and Mrs. Muphtins daughter. By judging on her face, there was a slight of depression and sadness on her face. She knew that if the court sets this nut head free, then there's no justice to it.  "Court dismissed! Tok .. Tok!"
