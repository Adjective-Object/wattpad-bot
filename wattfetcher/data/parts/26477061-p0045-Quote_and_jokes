Spoilers for Gurren Lagann ending ahead don't read if you don't want it to be spoiled!----
Has anyone else watched Gurren Lagann? Barely anyone I know has! I don't see how they haven't watched this epic anime! If you have watched it, did you Cry when Kamina died? I did I was like "Noooooo!". Also Nia is so cute but don't you just hate Rossiu? He's a bitch...
Also the ending is so cool! They throw galaxies at each other and Kamina is there! I was fangirling so hard I mean how can an anime be that awesome!
Anyway...
"Who the hell do you think I am?!"
