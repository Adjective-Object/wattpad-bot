"Okay, so what's the best mother in the world going to cook" Damon kissed his mother's forehead.
And let me tell you something. she got SHOCKED.
Did my words affect him ?
Naah, he probably wants some money.
"I-I'm cooking some spaghetti with meat balls" She smiled
WHAT ! what meat balls! god only knows what's in them.
I can't just tell her : sorry I won't eat with you because that meat may not be halal to eat, maybe you got some disgusting piggies in it .
"How about a better offer?" I spoke with a challenging tone and raised eyebrow with a smile at her.
"66" Damon whispered to me
"Bring it girl" She slammed the spoon on the table and untied the apron, Elina and Damon giggled. I like how she can just go with the flow, joke and act crazy with us.
"Today, Let me give you a special dinner on the Arabian way" I crossed my arms over my chest.
"What do you need for the mission?" She put a paper and a pen in front of me and I wrote what I needed.
Damon caught the paper and headed to the door.
"Oh wait, what parts of chicken do you want" he asked
"All of it"
"OK" he opened the door
"Alive" I said, their eyes popped out at me.
"I know what I'm doing, trust me" I assured them but the worries look on their faces didn't disappear.
"I'm telling you, I ain't killing any chickens" He shouted and got in his car.
......
*1 hour later*
"I forgot the spices" I slammed my forehead on the table.
"Call Damon before he gets back, because then we won't be able to move his butt off the couch"
I took Damon's number and called him.
"Hello"
"Salaam"
"What a lovely voice you got babe"
"Don't cross the lines Damon, I'm Leena"
"Oh *clears throat* missed me haa"
"No, just add some spices to the list"
"67"
"What ! you can't even see me"
"I can feel the eyebrow babe, I can feel the eyebrow"
"just go get some spices"
" Is that all ma'm ?"
"please don't kill my lovely chicken with your speed"
"You don't worry about me, All you want is the chicken. Is that what I get for saving you in the mall earlier"
"Thanks for reminding me, check your bank account, I payed you back, plus some tips for holding the clothes for me. Salaam" I hung up.
......
"I GOT THE CHICKEN" Damon slammed the door.
I saw the chicken struggling for air in his fist.
