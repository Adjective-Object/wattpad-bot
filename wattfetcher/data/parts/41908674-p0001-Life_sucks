Rosa pov.Oh no not school! I thought. I absolutely hate school. I hate school because I get bullied by everyone in my class and I mean EVERYONE. It's sucks being bullied. It's like everyone wants me to kill myself.
Anyway I arrived at school and I could already tell it was gonna be a rough day. People were looking at me , whispering and laughing about me.
I walked to the nearest class room and shut the door and got out my phone trying to keep myself calm. I texted Christina. Christina is my best and one of my only friends. Christina and I have been friends for years.
Me: Hey Tina.
Christina: Hey Rosa what's up? Also where are you?
Me: Um I'm in room 5, and the usual, people talking about me and that.
Christina: Ok. Sasha, Jasmine, and I will be there in a minute.
Me: Ok see ya in a few minutes then.
Christina: Yeah see ya in few minutes.
As soon as I put my phone away there was a tap on the door. I opened it and to my delight it was Tina, Sash, and Jazz. I shut the door and collapsed on one the couches in Mr Love's room.
Christina pov.
I entered room 5 and sat on a couch. I could tell Rosa had been crying. Her eyes were bloodshot and her face was red. So i took a deep breathe and started to talk....
A/N: Hey guys little cliffhanger there but hey this is my health project so don't judge me mates. Anyway please comment and vote. I  need feedback. See ya soon.
