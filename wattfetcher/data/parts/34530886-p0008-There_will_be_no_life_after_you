"My mother, she is a nurse in the weekdays and she volunteers at the cancer center and helps their." He said, he smiled a crooked smile and shrugged.
"My sister Esmee, she volunteers to help with the special education department in our school plus she is a high honor student." He sighed. Shivers ran down my spine like electricity I definitely like him.
He took a couple strides towards me "I... don't do anything yet... but right now, I'm focusing on helping you." He said.
It was hard to breathe with him this close to me. I desperately wanted to touch my lips with his. He put his hand on the side of my face and leaned in closer our breath was mixing together. I was honestly scared to death. He leaned in more, getting closer and all of a sudden the bedroom door opened we both jumped back as fast as we could.
"Hayden I'm ho-" we both jumped back as fast as we could a woman with beautiful blonde hair and dazzling hazel eyes came into the room. "Oh Hayden who's this?" She asked.
"Oh um... Mom this is my friend from school, Hailey this is... my mother."
