My name is Clove Kentwell. I'm just a sixteen year old girl who's moving to Santa Monica, California with my parents and sister, Sage. I might be just like you. Except for the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead. Earthbound spirits, my grandma called them. They are the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help. To tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
// Hey guys! Here is my first story on wattpad! :) This story is a Ghost Whisperer/Hunger Games mashup.
