That crushed it for him. He'd met some of his sports idols as a kid, and as outstanding men as they were, they could barely speak clearly and suffered from lingering head trauma. Many friends and family had warned him constantly of the lingering effects of pro sports. He'd have no knees left, be out of his mind, or something of that sort. He wasn't looking forward to it.
