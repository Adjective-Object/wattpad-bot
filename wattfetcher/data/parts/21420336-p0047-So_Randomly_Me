So, you know what I just realized?
No?
I'll tell you.
A few months ago I was showing my friend a book I wrote.
I had made a character a lot like me.
He said,"Make sure the character isn't too much like you or people are going to hate him."
;-;
I just realized he was offending me
Gods I have awesome friends XD
Also
did I tell you im scared of heights
No lie
You can punch me to death and I wouldn't care, but make me go somewhere high and I'll cry
Its embarrassing
But u guys are my friends
So u guys can know
Like they gave me a piggy back ride and I started screaming for my life.
And yesterday we were bored so we threw mops out the window
But it was on the third floor
So like I was just standing in the back awkwardly watching everyone else
._. It looked fun
But dangerous
THIS IS WHY IM NOT DUANTLESS
IM CANDOR
IM A PROUD NOSY CANDOR LIKE WILL USE TOÂ  BE
;-;

Dead
