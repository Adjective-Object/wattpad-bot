Hey y'all!Writing fanfictions didn't really make me feel satisfied as my dream is to be a writer. So this is from my brain, and my brain only! Haha! I really hope you enjoy it :) ...you probably won't read this though. Today is 10/11/14. Tomorrow is Remembrance Day. On the 11th hour of the 11th day, we shall think in silence to remember the soldiers who died in the Great War. I'm not sure if America does this but if you live in a country that does then don't forget to get a poppy! And if you're in London tomorrow, try and visit the Tower of London. Ceramic Poppies representing every solider that died is surrounding the tower, and the last poppy is being planted tomorrow. ------------I do hope you enjoy this book!
