My name is Aiden. I have never been normal. I'm eight years old, and my life isn't that great. I wish Jodie would just leave me. We both want that. "Aiden! Get downstairs, it's time for dinner!" Mom calls for me. "O-Okay!" I reply. I start to walk downstairs. I love my mom. She protects me from the monsters. In front of me, a glass flys across the room. "Jodie! Daddy doesn't like me because of you so knock it off!" I yell at her and run downstairs. "Everything okay Aiden?" Mommy asks. "No! I hate Jodie and I want her to leave me alone!" I say in fright. Mommy pulls up her phone and texts Daddy. "Mommy? Why are you messaging Daddy?" I ask her politely. "Huh? Oh no reason." My mom says, clearly lying. "You're lying mommy! I know you are!" I scream at her and run upstairs.
Once I reach my bedroom door I slam the door shut. I scream and start to cry in rage. "Jodie, go spy on her." Jodie growls in reply and she goes down stairs. 'Look at the texts.' I link to Jodie. Jodie looks at Mommy's texts.
Mom: We have to take him to Dr. Ness. It's urgent.Dad: I agree. He's going insane with his invisible freind.Just as that text sends, Daddy walks in. 'Go, Jodie. Scare the-' "AHHHHHH!" I scream. "Aiden!!" Mommy screams and runs up stairs. "MOMMY THE MONSTERS!!!!" I scream. "We're coming Aiden just hold on!" Mommy says. "It's locked!"
