I laid there motionless, trying to understand what had just occurred but all I felt was my body becoming numb and someone's cold hands tying me up. 'What is happening,' I thought to myself. I then felt my body being turned upwards and my eyes focused on the sky, where a light had seem to penetrate through the clouds. Staring at that light, a shadow I couldn't distinguish fell over me and asked with a muffled voice, "are you infected?"
Ready to respond, my body weakened entirely and I then blacked out into complete darkness.
