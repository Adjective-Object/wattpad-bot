I logged onto my laptop and got on Skype. I got a video call from my mom so I picked it up.
*Skype conversation*
Me: Hey!
Mom: Hi! Oh my gosh my Mamas you're so grown up.
Me: Ugh mom please don't started with that! (*laughing*)
Mom: Ok I'll stop. So how's everything? Do you have a special someone?
Me: Yeah, his name is Austin. He's really sweet and caring. He always makes me laugh and he's always there to support me and take care of me.
Mom: I'm glad you found someone and he sounds like a keeper.
Me: He is a keeper, I can't wait for you to meet him. He went to the store to buy some food for us and then he's coming back. Matter of fact, he should be on his way back.
Mom: Is he buying everything with his money or your money?
