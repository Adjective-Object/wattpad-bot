"It's only eight o'clock though?" Aunt Emili starts to follow me down the hall. I enter the guest bedroom, she follows. I don't respond and hope that she will take the hint to just leave me alone at the moment. "Hon can we talk about what happened today?" I ignore her once more trying to see if she is going to take the hint. "Hon, talk to me," I look down at my feet as she sits down on the guest bed - the one that I am going to sleep in.
"I don't want to talk about it." I finally say.
"Well I do, now talk. What was that all about?"
I quietly walk back out the room and down the hall to the linen cupboard. As I open the door to the cupboard I lift out a duvet and pillow and carry them into the lounge, setting them on the big blue couch that has been placed in the middle of the room.
I curl up under the duvet with my head lightly placed in the center of the pillow as I hear the sound of footsteps getting louder. I close my eyes in all hope that she will think I'm sleeping.
"Fine, we will talk about it tomorrow afternoon." She sighs.
I open my eyes slowly soon realizing that I had fallen asleep. I reach for my phone that is currently sitting on the floor beside the couch, but I reach a little too far and fall off.
"Are you okay?" Aunt Emili asks between laughs.
"I'm fine." I yawn as I try to stand up.
Once I am up, I have eaten my breakfast, I have gotten changed for school and I am actually awake, I head out the front door to wait for the bus. The bus arrives fairly quickly.
The day passes very fast, I think as the bell rings in my ear, but it is just like any ordinary day - boring.
"Okay class, you may pack up your things and leave now." Mr. Dram says politely.
I pack up my things along with everyone else, apart from I don't talk to many people, so I pack up quietly. I watch as everyone exits the class while I follow along side them. Once I have exited the building I enter the parking lot where I notice my mum's car is sitting. I wonder over to the silver car as it shines in the bright sunlight.
"Hey Mum," I say hopping into the car. But she doesn't reply, I watch as a tear falls from her eye. "Mum?" I ask sounding really concerned.
"I did it," She finally replies.
"You did what...?"
She looks up at me, her green eyes full of apprehension. My mind clicks as I realize what she is talking about.
"You left him?" I ask already knowing the answer.
I watch carefully as my mother nods.
