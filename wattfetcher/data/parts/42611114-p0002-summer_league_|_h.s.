"Mason!" A familiar voice called out.
Savannah.
"Great job today," she said, hugging me.
"Thanks! You did awesome too," I told her.
"So, are you ready for JOs?" Savannah smirked, raising an eyebrow.
"Oh, I dunno," I responded. "I mean, they're not until the end of the summer so......"
"Well, then we get ALL summer to practice! I mean, that's probably what Phils gonna make us do anyways," she whined.
"Mason!" Another familiar voice called out, except this time, it was a male voice.
"Speaking of the devil," Savannah laughed. "What does he want from you anyways?" She questioned.
"My dives. Or maybe my virginity. You never know," I smirked.
"Mason! That's so wrong! You're seventeen. He's twenty-four. He probably has a girlfriend that wants his," Savannah yell-whispered.
"Geez, it was just a joke," I nudged. She glared at me for a few seconds while I was sitting there, smiling like an idiot.
"Mason Grey! Get your ass over here right now or you will do at least 300 abs, right here, right now," Phil yelled. I put my face in my palms. Ugh. There is no way in hell that I'm doing 300 abs.
"Savannah, I should really go. We can talk later," I smiled. "I just don't wanna do abs. Especially not 300."
"Okay, but you better call me later," she joked.
"Don't worry, I will," I sighed, walking away.
"So, you wanted to talk to me," I said, walking over to where my coach was sitting.
"I just wanted to say that you did a great job today, and that if you put in hard work, determination, and the drive, you could possibly win JOs. But, I wanna see it, Mason," he said. "Goodnight. See you tomorrow for practice. The JO practice schedule will be put online tonight. Look for it. Practice is tomorrow morning from eight to ten. Be there," Phil told me.
"Call or text me if you have any questions," he grinned, handing me a slip of paper.
"Thanks," I answered, stuffing the piece of paper into my pocket. I was ready for JOs, and would do whatever it takes to win.

A/N: yay!! first chapter is done. it's kinda getting off to a slow start, but it'll start to move a bit quicker throughout the next few chapters. so I think this fanfic is a lil different from the others cuz people usually don't put sports into them (especially not swimming and diving) but imma a swimmer and I used to do diving over the summer so I know some stuff lol. I hope y'all like it so far :))
