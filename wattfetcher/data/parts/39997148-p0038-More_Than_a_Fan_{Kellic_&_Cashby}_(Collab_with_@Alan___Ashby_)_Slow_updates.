"What are you doing?" I jumped and looked over and saw Lynn standing there.
"Hey Lynn."
"Hey," She said smiling, "What are you doing?"
"Have you seen Alan around?"
"Uh last time I saw him he was taking a picture of Aaron and Mike throwing marshmallows at Tony."
"And where was that located around?"
"The campfire somewhere."
"Thank you." I said, "See you around."
"See you."
I walked off towards the campfire and finally saw him sitting on a chair looking up at the stars. I took a seat next to him and looked up.
"Whatcha looking at?" I asked.
"The stars."
"Boring."
"No, its beautiful. I love the stars."
"It's just a bunch of balls of gas." I said crinkling my nose.
"Well they're cool. I love astronomy."
"That's cool I guess."
"It really is cool."
"Uh huh, so are you having fun?"
"Not really."
"Why not? There's plenty to do. Make s'mores, roast a hot dog. There's a marshmallow war going on I think and you can always get drunk."
"I mean the picture taking is fun, but everything else is only fun for so long, oh and I don't drink."
"Oh you don't?" I asked.
"I'm nineteen Austin."
"It's not like anyone here is going to say anything."
"Well I know that, but I just never cared for it."
"Well we can always go do something else. Come on let's walk around." I said getting up.
"I guess we can do that." He said and got up.  We walked around for a while until Alan pointed to where Vic and Kellin were standing doing some weird kind of dancing. "Let's go talk to Vic and Kellin."
"Okay." We walked over to them and they smiled.
"Guys!" Kellin shouted wrapping an arm around Alan's shoulder. "You should so have Vic make you a drink!" He slurred, "His drinks are amazing!"
"No." Alan said.
"Why not? Oh my god he is so much fun!" Kellin said and let go of Alan stumbling back over to Vic who was laughing at Kellin.
"How much has he had?" I asked trying not to laugh.
"Like three cups of- um I forgot." Vic said looking down at his cup.
"I have to babysit Vic, he- he's not allowed to get drunk." Kellin said finishing off his drink.
"Cut him off." Alan said, "No more for him."
"I'm a grown up Alan! I can do whatever I want." Kellin said and took Vics cup.
"Well be responsible at least." He said signing.
"I think it's a little too late for that." I told him quietly as Kellin pulled Vic over to the marshmallows.
"Yeah I know." He said watching them throw marshmallows at each other, "Oh my god!"
