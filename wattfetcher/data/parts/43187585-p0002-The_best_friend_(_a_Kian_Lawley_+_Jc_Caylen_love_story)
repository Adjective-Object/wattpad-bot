I upload it and 10 minutes later I'm getting text messages from a bunch of people saying that they support me. One message stood out From: Jc Faggot
I start feeling depressed again. I can't believe he said that. I think to my self " I need to stop, he's never gonna like me back so might as well move on" I wipe my tears and look on Twitter. All the tweets are positive which make me smile. I walk down the stairs and Connor hugs me. " I'm so proud of you" I smile and hug back .
Few more hour later:I'm in bed when I see Jc uploaded a main channel video. It's called " the end" I click on it and I see the face I've grown oh so attached to.
" what's up guyssss! Jc here, and I'm making this really short video to tell you guys something. I decided to quit Kian and Jc. And no it's not because of Kian being gay" he says that a bit harshly " it's because I'm really stressed out right now, I'm gonna start posting videos on here every week, I don't know what day, but you will get a video of me every week, bye guys!" Bye the end I'm crying. He left because of me. I'm ruining everything.
I cry myself to a dreamless sleep that night.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~AN: so this is my first chapter!!!! Yayyyy!! I've always wanted to read a Jian fanfic but all of them weren't really interesting. So I decided to make my own! So this is my update schedule
