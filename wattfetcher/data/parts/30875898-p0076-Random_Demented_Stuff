When you cut...
The skin around it puffs up, red like wine. The blood beads up perfectly, in crimson dotted lines. It tingles and burns at first. But then it feels good, so you're already through the worst of it. Your body might be in pain, but your mind feels so at ease. It feels so amazing that your mind asks for just one more cut. One turns to two, two turns to four. At this point you just let go and keep dragging the razor against your skin. There is no stopping the warmth that flows through you. Everyone else is happy, so why can't you be too? The blood starts to drip and pour from your cuts, and you love it. A smile spreads across your face.
