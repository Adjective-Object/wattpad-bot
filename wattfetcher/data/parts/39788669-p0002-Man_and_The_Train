I looked around. No one noticed, all too busy on their phones. I look at the security cameras, the red light off. I looked around for some security guards, there were none. Fear and confusion filled me. Why did he do that? How is it that no one was watching? How were there no security guards around? What happened? Questions filled my mind, but I forced myself to stop. And get on the train, to a seat. My whole attitude changed with that one man. For the whole trip, my eyes were glued to the ground. I wished it was a dream. Though I knew it wasn't. So, when my stop came. I forced on a smile, and acted as though nothing happened.
