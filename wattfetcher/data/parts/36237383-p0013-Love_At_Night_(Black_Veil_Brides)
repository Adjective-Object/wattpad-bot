Over the months, Ashley took me to many Social events where i would end up walking home with Jake. Jake half understood why I longed for light. Today was yet another day but when night fell things were about to change. Something big happened but Ashley wouldnt tell me. He wanted me to be there and I couldnt decline the offer. He would do what he want with me and that was to show me off to random people like some prize. I slipped into a midnight blue dress and walked out to the front where Ashley was waiting for me. He smiled when he saw me and bowed his head.
"You look elegant tonight Kat." He said. He took my hand and kissed it gently. He knew how to be a true gentleman at times. He walked me to the edge of the woods but we took another path. Ashley was determined to get to this place as he walked quicker. We got to a point where vampires started to appear. I knew we were getting close. There was a clearing. In the middle of the clearing was a block of concrete. Vampires surrounded the outsides but none of them were inside the circle. Ashley grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the block. Jake slowly walked towards me with a knife in his hand. Ashley looked around the circle.
"Goddamm it! Wheres Jinxx!" He shouted. Jinxx appeared and made his way towards us. Ashley whispered something to him. Jake handed Jinxx the knife as howls went off. CC hauled out two werewolves in chains.
"Ash... she shouldnt see this." Jake said. Ashley pushed him aside and grabbed the chains off CC. They were defenseless and hopeless. Jinxx looked at his knife and admired the sharpness. Before he could do anything, I stepped forward.
"What is happening!" I shouted. Ashley shook his head. Jinxx shrugged and slit one of the werewolves throats. Blood poured out and stained the ground.
"You said you wanted peace!" I shouted as Jake dragged me away. He had a smug smile on his face. He laughed deeply and looked at me.
"Kat... never trust a lier since they never tell the truth."
