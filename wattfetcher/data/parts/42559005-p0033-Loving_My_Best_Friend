"alright class......" after that i just zoned out.____________________(Sabrinas Pov)
it was lunch time and i didnt feel like eating lunch, so i told tristen to go without me and i went to the bleachers.
i looked at all the students from afar, and then i saw jack and leigh lindquist sitting on his lap.
that made my blood boil, i started getting up.....but then i remember we arent together. i sit back down.
he's an asshole, i dont need him. i will do just fine without him.
then he does something, that even if we hated each other , i thought he would never do.....he fucking kissed her, and they full on made out.
i let a tear slip. ugh! why cant i just forget about him!
you cant you idiot!
what the hell is that?
im your concious duh!
well sorry ! someones a little sassy!
you should know that already....i mean i am YOUR concious so i would think , im pretty much like you!
Oh shut up!
Quit talking.
i groan. then the bell rings signaling lunch is over, i get up off the bleachers, then i go to atheltics.
oh yeah i forgot to mention, me and tristen decided to try out for volleyball this year.
i walk to the gym and sit on the bleachers with the rest of the girls. a few minutes later tristen gets here, and sits with me.
"oh my god, im starving! jack had his tounge down leigh's damn throat i couldn't because i lost my damn appetite!" she said. i looked at her.
"oh sorry, i know you didnt wanna hear that" she says giving me sincere look. i take a deep breathe "dont worry about" i say fame smiling.
"alright ladies, go to the locker room, get dressed and yall are going to scrimmage" coach Rivas says.
we all get up and head to the locker room.__________________i run into my house all happy and i run to my mom in the kitchen .
"MOM I MADE THE TEAM!" i say. "oh my god thats great sweetie!" she says hugging me.
then my dad comes downstairs. "so......how did it go?" my dad said. "I MADE THE TEAM!" i said hugging him. "alright! im so proud of you!" he said smiling.
"thanks dad!" i say. "oh and tristen made the team too!" i said. "thats great!" my mom says. "yeah it is" i say smiling.
i go upstairs and lay on my bed. today was a bad then good, then bad day.
fucking leigh made the damn team too. ugh! this bitch is everywhere!
i really hope this year is what i'd hope it would be. i was bored ....so i made a vine.
"hey babes, hope you had a good day i didnt! but....all thesr nice comments and stuff are putting a smile on my face!" i say.
then post it. i go on twitter and do a mini following spree. im not FAMOUS FAMOUS, im just known by a lot of people.........
