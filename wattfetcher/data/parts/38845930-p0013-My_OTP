Jordan's POV
I got home from Erin's around 2 am or so. when I got back she called to tell me that next time if we should go to someone's house, it should be mine not her's. she kind of got in trouble with her DAUGHTER for being loud and waking her up. that kid is so cute.
My alarm went off the next day at 8 am like usual but I didn't get up until 11. I am so mad. I can't do that again.
Erin's POV
I tried to call Jordan at quarter to 10 and he didn't pick up so I left a message
"Jordan. you're obviously not there so call me back when you are. bye, love you. p.s. I need some help. give you more details later bye... again. Jesus."
I don't even know what that was supposed to be. He needs to help me with colab video's and a boyfriend girlfriend video that he didn't know about.
I called him again at 11 and woke him up. why wasn't he awake?
"Hi baby, what's up?" he said EXTREMELY tiredly sounding.
"Oh my god. did I wake you up?" I asked
"yeah. but that's okay, I should have been up anyway. Damn! It's 11:00?" he responded.
"alright well, I need help."
"Hmm?" he asked as if he were asleep responding to everything I say with a grunt.
"I was thinking we could open up a little to our viewers and make a boyfriend/girlfriend video."
"Ohh, you think we should?" he said slightly less tired sounding.
"Yeah?" I said as if it were a question yet still it was an answer.
"You. of all people, you?" he asked
"Yes. I don't wan't to feel like I can't say anything or have to edit some stuff out of the video's if I say it then regret it."
"I think it's a really good idea." he said
"Awesome. so you will?"
"I will."
"Oh, thank you Jordan."
"We're telling them?"
"Guess so."
