"Blaine, it's okay." I said trying to calm her down.
"Why did he bother you?" Why wouldn't he? I wanted to say but kept it in. Telling Blaine about other guys that are interested in her always puts me down.
"Well, he just likes you and wanted me to convince you to give him a chance." I said in a quiet voice.
"So he beats up my best friend?" That DID sound pretty dumb.. But she said it not me!
"Hey I put up quite a fight, you know.." I said clearing my throat.
"Of course...if he thinks I'm going out with him, he's crazy! I'm sorry Alan. That's such a dumb thing for him to do, I can assure you I'm definitely not going out with him."
"Blaine, you're ranting." I said with an amused chuckle. She let out a sigh.
"It's just I wish people would stop being so judgy you know?"
"I know." I said in a blank voice rubbing my sore back, but I tried to bring ease to our conversation. "Don't worry about it, at least I have a great friend for me always."
"Your mom?" Blaine joked. I rolled my eyes.
"Okay, okay! I've heard enough, I'll talk to you later!" She started laughing.
"I'm starting on the tacos then!" She promised.
"Alright then, I'll see you in an hour." I told her.
"Yeah, okay then bye!" She hung up.
"Bye!" I sighed. "I love you Blaine.." I whispered into the phone. But I knew she couldn't ever feel the same about a nerd like me. She deserves the best..
