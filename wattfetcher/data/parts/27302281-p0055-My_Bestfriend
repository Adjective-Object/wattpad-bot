"Its 3:00 you hungry "  I asked him
" yeah " he mumbled  rubbing his eyes
Justin POV
" yeah " I mumbled then looked down at kylie who was still sound asleep  so I tried to get up without  waking her up   when I got up kylie was  still sound asleep  I  walked in the kitchen and signaled  for my mom to follow
" I want to  surprise kylie with  lunch "  I whispered
" ok what did you have in mind "  my mom asked
" Chicken Alfredo "  I said quietly
" ok get the chicken out to thaw "   my mom ordered then  sat the chicken then boiled some water for the noodles
Hour later
"Set the table then wake kylie up" my mom said
I  set the table then walked over to kylie and shook her slightly and her eyes fluttered open and she smiled slightly and rubbed her eyes
"  good afternoon beautiful "  I said pecking her lightly on the forehead and she yawned something like good evening  and what's for lunch I laughed slightly
" me and my mom made you lunch your favorite "  I whispered softly
" huh" she mumbled slowly drifting off
" we made chicken Alfredo"  I whispered then she jumped up causing me to fall back then she walked up to me and helped me up then walked to the kitchen and smiled when she saw my mom
"  thanks for the food Pattie" kylie said  hugging my mom
" it was  actually Justin's idea"  my mom spoke up looking over at me  kylie turned around and smiled then walked over to me
" well thank you" she said pecking me on the lips then  putting food on a  plate and handing it to me then  did the same for my mom then her self  then we all walked
Over to the table and sat down and ate
