They witnessed her destruction,
Then were left to wonder why,
She saw nothing but darkness,
Though the stars shine in her eyes,
But maybe they'd forgotten,
When they failed to see the cracks,
That a stars light shines the brightest,
When it's starting to collapse.
(Not mine but I forget who it's by)
