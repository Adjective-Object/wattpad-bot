She stuttered which made me crack a smile.
"I'd like to come over and help you catch up."
"Thanks. After school Mrs. Mattias is going to help me by telling me what I missed. She said she would give me time to catch up and she said she would help me understand a few things."
"Alright." I said. "Call me after?"
I saw her smile.
"Chase! My goodness. Look, I just..." Tracy started , but I politely interrupted her.
"Tracy, don't worry about the project, I'll do it myself." I said.
"Don't try to argue either, Tracy." Skull said. "Now, what did you not get about ignore her? I thought you were smart. Guess I was wrong."
He shrugged making me glare at him. Then smirk as I looked at Skull and Tania. Tania understood my stare as her eyes narrowed into slits.
"Oh don't you dare. You know damn well I didn't, don't you test me on my anger." Tania said.
"Aww T you didn't tell her about- OWE! You Jack-Ass." I said as he back handed me.
"Oh, goodness. You know how my arm just twitches at times. Sorry 'bout that." Skull said with that fake apology and a grin on his face.
"Twitches my as-" Someone covered my mouth before I could finish looking down to the hand I saw it was Jaycie's.
"Don't finish that sentence! My brother might over hear you." She whispered to me.
I looked over at her brothers table to see him looking at me and Jaycie. He narrowed his eyes at me. I looked to see that my arm is still over her and she was just talking to Thalia. Her hand had been removed ever since I looked up. She hadn't noticed her brother glaring at us. She looked up at me.
"Hey Chase, do you want to eat lunch with our table? I've heard Skull has been so I thought you'd like to eat with us as well." Jaycie said.
"I don't know. I don't think your brother would like that especially since he sees my arm around you." I said.
Then she looked up to look at his table, but see that he isn't there. Uh-oh. Where did he go?

*Jaycie's POV*
I looked for my brother to see him coming over. I knew he was getting pissed. So I had one thought of what to do. I threw on an innocent smile and ran over to him.
"Paul, Chase and Tania helped me out with catching up with Bio! They made it sound so easy and simpler! I think I might take the test tomorrow! Chase said that he'd help me some more with Bio to! Than Tania and Thalia said tomorrow that they'd help me with Geometry, Justin is going to help me with World History and Morse said he'd help me with Spanish." I said as I smiled a huge smile towards him.
He looked down with soft eyes. "What about Band and Lit?"
"Well today after school Mrs. Mattias said she would give me all the lesson plans and help me try to understand them. But I was thinking maybe you could help me with Band and Lit." I asked my eyes full of hope.
"Sure Jaycie." He said with a smile.
I grinned hugging him again.
