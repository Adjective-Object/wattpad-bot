No one told me what to do so I got creative and ranted about school!
I have 22 girls in my class
=.=
All you hear all day is,"OMG DID YOU SEE HOW SHE LOOKED AT ME? WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?"
Gosh people, calm down! People be looking at you cuz your such an idiot that simple!
I'm literally just there listening to the conversations and putting my opinions there.
There's like 6 guys.
Not cute guys. Annoying very talkative guys who think they are all that and never shut up.
I'm just there like,"Kill me. Actually no. Just go die."
I am a very depressing person XD
But when I have a conversation with one of my friends I usually talk about le gym teacher
YES THAT GYM TEACHER
*squeals*
He's so cuteeeee
;-; he can't be mine
That's sad
But I stare at him a lot and he smiled at me XD he thought I was listening >XD
But I'm actually thinking,"Man, if he was in a book... I would date him...."
Me and my dumb thoughts XD
How did my rant about how many girls there were In my class turn to this?
I blame dolphins.
Dolphins are cute @3@
Like snakes @~@
I love snakes they be all cool like,"Legs? Nahhh I don't need those!"
I think I would look cool with an eyepatch
So I'll try to mess up an experiment in science class :D
And get an eyepatch
I be a pirate.
Wait... What am I talking about O.o
Okay back to the school rant
Homework
So much Fudging homework
Why
*falls to knees and looks at sky* whyyyyyy
I can't find the time to read or write.
Which sucks
And then their is the LOCKERS
I HATE THEM THEY ARE SO SMALL I HAVE TO SQUISH MY BOOKBAG IN TO FIT SIDEWAYS!
Everyone is so cramped together!!! I'm just there like,"EW HUMAN CONTACT!"
Okay this was a long chapter byeeee
