"Let me, please?" Luke asked, blocking my path to the table. I sighed out in defeat and handed him the plates. Might as well put him to work, even it's just setting the table. It'll get him to shut up.
"Do you know when mom will be home?"
"She didn't say. I thought maybe you'd know."
We both shrugged at not knowing the answer. Mom always went to random business meetings and returned at random times as well. It was weird but a normal thing for me. Still gets under my skin, but I've learned to live with it...kinda.
The three of us awkwardly ate together. Luke complimented my cooking skills which made me, unfortunately, not hate him as much. I've never been told my cooking is good so it was nice to hear. Jordan and him talked for the most part but it was mostly silent chewing.
The two of them settled on watching a movie so we could eat dessert and be entertained. I didn't really want to be around Luke any longer, but there was no way I was leaving my friend in the same room as him alone. So I ate my banana split, curled up on the floor in the middle of my guests. (We don't eat icecream on the couch or I'll be slaughtered for it. Mom's threatened me plenty of times to not doubt it.)
"I need to talk to you." Luke whispered half way through the movie. I squirmed away from him a bit. I didn't want to talk to him, but it could be important. Maybe he want's to explain himself. Finally.
"Fine. Later." I mumble back. Jordan eyes us and tells us to shut up. I point my finger at Luke who accepts the blame by putting his hands up. We both motion zipping our lips. And for a second I almost laughed. Then I remembered I was still pissed at him and saved myself.
Luke was making it so incredibly hard to hate him though. And I don't know if I was a fan of that.
