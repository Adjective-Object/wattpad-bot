,"fthhhhhhh!!that was close heheheh" i said as i switched legs and resumed climing up on my bed.picking up my computer i type in my password
(that you may NOT know *evil laugh* MWAHAHAHAHA>:3)
going to youtube i type in my favorite hollywood undead song and put on my ear phones drowing any sound that was ever around me and was surrounded by drums,guitar,and singing. i let out a relaxed sigh of relief.
