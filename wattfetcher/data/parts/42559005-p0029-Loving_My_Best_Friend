"me and eric are about to go vandalize some stuff!" jj says . we are making vine, where we are nerds and we write = 16 on the car next to where it says 4Ã—4.
"hi!" i wave. "you sure about this?" i ask. "yeah do it hurry" i write it. and we snicker running off. then the vine ends.
we look at it and laugh are asses off. i run inside and show everybody. "oh my god jack!" tristen and sabrina are laughing their asses off.
they finally stop after her dad yells "shut up sabrina, you sound like a damn seal!" then that makes us laugh,tristen laughs harder and sabrina glares.
me and jj go change then go back down stairs. "whats for dinner!" i say. "we dont know , sabrina and tristen are cooking tonight " my mom says.
i go to the couch and sit on sabrina. "jack you fat ass , get your big butt off of me!" she says trying to push me off.
i laugh and get up off of her. i stand in front of her, put my hands on each side of her on the couch and lean near her face.
"what are you cooking baby girl?" i ask with a goofy smile , she smiles and says "you will find out when i start cooking, but for now our parents and you guys are going outside, our dads and yall boys are playing football" she says.
"oh okay, im gonna go put on basketball shorts" i say kissing her. "okay"

once everyone leaves outside, me and tristen start cooking, we are making ham and motzerella cheese quesadillas, with a bowl of fruit, and a veggie tray with ranch in the middle.
i start grabbing everything and start cooking._________________Finally! we are done! i wipe my hands on a dish towel and grab the huge platter with the quesadillas, tristen grabs the vegetable tray.
i open the door with ny foot and walk out to our huge dining patio.
"FOODS READY!" i yell to the boys out in the field.
i set the stuff down, and go back to get the fruit platter.________________"holy shit!....that was amazing baby girl, thank you!" jack says kissing me.
i smile, "your welcome baby". then tristen clears her throat. "oh and you too tristen" jack says. we all laugh.
