Hello everyone. My name is Zack. I wanted to formally inform you because you are the only one that doesn't treat me like I'm a kicked puppy or something like that.
The reason why many people treat me like that is because of one thing. My girlfriend was murdered. When you read that last sentence, you were probably really shocked. (So was I when I came to find out)
I mean, who wouldn't be shocked. One day, your girl was holding your hand and smiling, the next day, she died. What?! How did this happen?! Why did it have to happen to her, you may ask.
I'm going to try to figure that out, so stay with me. I write these letters because I feel like it's a personal message to my dead girlfriend, Sydney.
So Sydney, if you hear this, I miss you to death and I love you. I pray that you can hear me. I'm going to figure this out.
Love,Zack Middleton
