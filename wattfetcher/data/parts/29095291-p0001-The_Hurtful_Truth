Let me tell you how it all began. Read there stories and they will tell you all that you need to know about there past, where the parents went wrong.
There once was a women and a man who loved each other so very much that he would give up everything for his wife and baby boy. That baby boy looked so much like his father; Black hair, sea green eyes, and a very handsome boy to come. The problem is the father's brother did not like how his brother dropped everything just for a women and his son. So he did anything he could do, he banded all the Gods from ever seeing their children after they were born. Now the father never forgot about his baby boy, nor his wife he just had to wait until the right time.

There was another couple who also loved each other but, this family was not as perfect as the first. The mother tried to hold a curse that she could not handle, The Curse of Delphi.  Something none should try to hold. Their son had Sandy blonde hair, crystal blue eyes, and a joyful laugh. Sadly the parents didn't know what he was destined for, no one did, except the father. He thought that if he stayed away he would be doing good, one of the worst mistakes he could make that would endanger the whole world.People wouldn't understand him except her.
Now the last was about a baby girl who would one day be a beautiful women. Remember that father with a brother, well that brother had a wife and had two baby girls. Those two girls were inseparable, until one one of them died, the oldest, Thalia. The mother never wanted the two girls so when they were both twelve they left. There father loved them even if he didn't show it most of the time. That is why he changed the oldest daughter to a tree, and blessed the youngest to be the strongest, smartest, most beautiful demigod girl  of her time, and everyone loved her.
