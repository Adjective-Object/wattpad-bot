I tweet'Hey @ the orthodontist doing a following spree'.I follow a lot of people before I end it.'Following spree over sorry if I didn't follow uðŸ˜”'."Mia Grier,"someone says.I look up and its the orthodontist.I get and walk with him.He tells me to lay on the bed."What color do you want?"He asks."Blue,"I say annoyed with this.He puts me to sleep and puts my braces on.When he finished my mom took me out of the room."Mom my teeth hurt,"I complain."Stop complaining,"she says.Once we get home I get in pjs and sleep.Since we have to get up @4 am.
