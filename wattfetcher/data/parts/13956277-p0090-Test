After two classes, I saw Simon, half of his face was covered with bandages, so was his right hand, girls were gathered around him the way flies gather around food. Simon made eye contact with me by his one and lonely uncovered eye, I felt shame flowing from my eyes, "Are you okay ", "What happened to you?" I kept watching as girls were touching him as if they were checking if he was fine, Simom stepped away from their hands,  "I'm fine, it's just that I brought some coffee and cake to a beautiful, nice and good girl and she threw it on me" He said sadly, I smirked at how he was good in acting, "What? Who is she ?" One of the girls freaked out, "What a heartless Bi*-","Dont you dare describe her with any of those stinky words because she is way more better than you think" My heart skipped a beat when he defended me, the girls started mumbling some words and walked away from him. Simon started walking in my direction, I freaked out and started walking away but he rand and blocked my way, "Can't handle a joke ha?" He smirked with the uncovered half of his lips, "AND HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT WAS A JOKE ? You knock on my window and tell me yiu were clubbing and Damon got drunk, its not hard to believe", "So you're not going to apologize?", "OKAY, I'm so_",  "MAN ! What happened to you?" Damon cut me off, Simon sighed in frustration, "Someone threw a cup of coffee on my face", "WHO IS HE ? I'll beat the shi*-", "No cursing" I cut Damon off, "Fine, gotta go to my class, see you later dude" Damon left. "I guess we have a class together. After you ... Ma'lady" I laugher, "Wait ! Arent yiu at least going to carry my books for me ? You didn't even apologize", "Use your other hand" I raised an eyebrow, "I'm holding my bag", "FINE" I snapped his books and sighed, "But the good news is, Imma get my pretty face back in a week" He sighed, "Shut up before  I beat you up in a way no doctor will be able to put your eyes and ears back in their places", "Take it easy tough girl".
"Did you see what happened to Simon? Poor hot guy" Diana said, "Speaking of Simon, I see he made you his pet, carrying his books and all" Hannah whispered in my ear, "What? Come on ! Simon's pet ? Im the one who burnt him, I had to make it uo for him" The girls gasped, I saw Molly running toward me, "What a heartless unfaithful girl, what has he done to you ? NOTHING but being nice and good. And what have you done? You burnt him ! He spent 3 hours in hospital because of you. How could you be careless?" Molly scolded me, I lowered my head in shame and sadness, "I-I'm sorry" I apologized, "And after everything you've done,he defended you in front of the girls earlier and forced a smile to cross his face tho it hurts like hell" Mollh said then started walkimg awal, "I'll make it up for him, I promise just listennnnn!" But she didn't.
It was time for PE class. I went to change my blue skirt with huge pants to be able to move. All the girls were talking about Simon, "I think he finally fell in love" one of them said, come on ! What love? If a guy is being nice and friendly to a girl they call it 'love' stupid. "No way, he's mine" then the started fighting over him, I sighed then changed my clothes.
I walked out and saw the boys streching and acting attractive to attract girls, but then, there was Simon, looking sad and sitting on the bench, "How could she decline him" I heard a girl say then she walked to him and started rubbing his injuried hand than held it close to her mouth to kiss it but he pulled is hand back, I like that ! Then there was Damon, showing off his six-packs with girls around him, I raise an eyebrow at him and he covered his body. "Wanna play little girls ?" I asked the boys, "We're gonna beat you this time" William said, "Different rules this time" I raised an eyebrow, "What are they?" Peter asked, "2 against 2, we'll play as couples"I said. "Fine, Me and Damon" William said, "That's not how it goes, its you and a girl" I saw surprise in everybody's eyes, "Okay, Me and you then" Damon said, "Sorry, It's me and SIMON, you all go choose somebody" Simon was looking at me with surprise as I was walking toward him, "Are you serious?", "Are you able to play?" I raised an eyebrow, "I guess", "Then, yes I am, get up".
