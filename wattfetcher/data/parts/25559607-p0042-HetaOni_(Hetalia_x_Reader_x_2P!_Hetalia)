Since, no one was there to see me, I waved my hand in front of me and opened a menu screen. I decided to check how Germany and Italy were doing.
---------------
> Germany & Italy<
"That guy was a little bigger than before, don't you think? Maybe we really should go back to help them..." Italy said with a sullen expression.
Germany frowned. "No, first we must accomplish the mission that was given to us. Japan can take care of himself. We have to fully understand this house so that we can also lighten his burden."
"Ve. All right. Besides, if we run into that thing, I'd rather run away." Italy said in a scared voice.
"Duly noted. Anyway, let's search these rooms once more and then...Hum... report to England." Germany said.
Italy then lightened up. "Okay! Let's do our best, Germany."
The two went down to the first floor. They then headed for the hallway by the Tatami rooms.
Used: Hallway Key.
Then they were suddenly chased by the monster, so they headed to the toilet. When the coast was clear, they decided to search somewhere else and saw the pantry room. They went inside and search for anything of interest. There, they saw a safe.
"It's a safe! Oh, but it's locked." Italy said sadly.
Germany inspected the safe. "If it weren't, there wouldn't be any point to it.It looks like it's a four-digit numeric combination...
We still have insufficient information. Let's investigate a little more."
"Too bad~" Italy said.
They then go back to the 1st floor hallway. In one of the closets, they found a piece of paper.
"Hmm~ Another piece of paper." Italy said.
"It's similar to the piece we found earlier. Here, let me take a look." Germany said as he reached for the paper.
"....It looks like the cross-section view of pasta or something like that!" Italy said in an oblivious manner.
Germany furrowed his eyebrows. "Why...?"
Italy tilted his head. "You think it's something else? Well, it doesn't look like a map, either. I wonder what it is..."
After a brief silence, a cellphone suddenly rung.
Germany jumped in surprise. "Moaargh!!"
Italy was scared by his friend's reaction. "Hiii!! Don't scare me like that, Germany!"
"S-sorry. That sound? Isn't it your cell phone?" Germany said.
"Eh? Oh, y-you're right. Why? Our phones get no signal here!" Italy said, confused.
Germany frowned. "How am I supposed to know?! Anyway, try answering it."
Italy took out his phone and checked who was calling. "Ve... It's a number-withheld call...
C... ciao..."
Nothing was heard except a sound from a piano.
"... Uh?" Italy said as the line got cut off.
"What's wrong?" Germany asked.
Italy put his phone back in his pocket. "I'm not sure. I heard a sound and then the call was cut off."
