“Oh God, Zoe,” Vince put both of his palms on my cheeks and gently rubbed the tears away. “Oh man, I didn’t mean to make you cry. I swear I didn’t.” He pushed a strand of hair away from my face, calming me down. “Don’t cry, Zoe. Don’t cry.”
How could I not? It was a very disturbing thought. Someone I had lived my whole life with had sinned. Sobbing even harder than before, I brought my hands up to Vince’s chest, ready to push him away.
But before I could think of anything else, Beast plundered me against the wall and pressed his lips against mine.

And then everything went black.
