"A time machine, huh?"
Erin Faylen never thought she'd be one of the first few people to see a working time machine, let alone travel in one. With the time machine, she goes on a big, crazy adventure going back to the past to save and change the future with the help of her best friend Marty McFly and doctor Emmett Brown.
Disclaimer I do not own Back to the Future I simply own Erin and her plot. All rights go to the rightful owners.
a.n. So I was watching the movie Back to the Future and I though why the hell not make a book to it. I really loved this movie and I hope you guys enjoy this book. - Zully
