"Are you Okay ? you seem distracted today, something is wrong" He said.
"No sir, I'm totally fine" I jumped.
"You wanna play rough" I raised an eyebrow, William and Simon nodded.
"Okay. Girls will teach you a lesson in basketball today" Diana snapped her fingers in a Z shape.
"Ha-ha, Really ? Show us what you got chicks" Jake smirked at me.
"let the ball roll" I said.
We were boys against girls, which is not fair since these boys are giants !!!! But nobody challenges Leena Ahmed and wins.
"Hayley I'm free" I caught the ball she threw.
"Na-aah, where are you going" Tom blocked me and took the ball
"Hey ! you were nice" I frowned.
"But not on the playground baby" He winked, Ashley pulled the ball from him and I winked at her
"You distracted me ! you little leprechaun" He said. I ignored him and ran to the basket
Ashley passed to Helen, Helen passed to Molly, Molly passed to ..... PETER !!!!!!
We gave her the 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU' look.
"He winked at me, he's hot" she shrugged.
I ran to get to Peter but he threw the ball to Damon who gave it to William, so I ran to William who eventually passed it to Jake, so I ran to Jake and Hayley followed me.
"I'll give it to you for a kiss" he winked at me.
"Hmmm Okay" I walked a bit closer and pulled the ball when he closed his eyes.
The boys gave him the same look we gave to Molly minutes ago.
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU" Simon shouted at him.
From me to Helen To Molly to Hayley then Diana and eventually ... me.
"IN YOUR FACE BOYS" I scored. I get really competitive sometimes.
The boys whined.
"YOU'RE JUST LUCKY BABE, JUST LUCKY" William shouted angrily
"YEAH YEAH WHATEVER GIRLIES" Molly shouted sarcastically.
"We let you beat us because we don't like to see you crying and watch all that make up stream down your face" Lewis said.
"I ain't putting any make up you losers, just face it. YOU LOST" All the girls laughed
"You won't beat us in anything else, like wrestling" Simon said
"Ha ha ha, I believe I will" I turned around to the girls' room to get changed and take a shower, but I heard some fast steps coming in my direction.
So he's trying to prove I'm wrong ? poor Simon.
"You can't even get out of my grip" He surrounded me with his hands and squeezed me
"ugghhh let me go you stinky stink piece of stinks, you're sweaty" I said and the boys bursted in laughter.
"Let her go" Helen ran toward us but William blocked her
"Simon you better let her go before she gets angry" Damon said, he was trying to save his friend because he remembered the flip that almost broke is ribs.
"She's just an angry hot chick" He said then threw me over his back.
