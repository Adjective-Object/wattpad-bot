Jake asks "who is he?" I reply "h-he is my " he interrupted me and says "boyfriend" then grabs me by my ass and kisses me. WTF! . It felt good but I thought I just had broken up with him? Why the hell is he kissing me I push him away and I smile and Jake replies "I-i never knew you had a boyfriend" I had to reply "yes. Can we watch a movie?" He said "sure that is why I messaged you for" I reply "well now I don't fucking have a phone thanks to my...boyfriend...." He replied "oh" and I say "lets go watch Insidious chapter 3" awe all agreed as we enter the movies I line up and order a insidious chapter 3 premiere box that came with one pack of m&m 1 large popcorn nachos and a coke! I imitate Ricky Dillion from YouTube and say "YUMMMM!" While I continue with Tyler Oakley " YASS BITCH!" as the two boys stared at me like a freak I imitate Miranda Sings "Haterds! Back offff!" As we walk into movie #29
