"You can tell me the details later. Just tell me the most important things now." my red-eyed ally said.
".....I'm... not sure what it means, but...
From now on... if I make a choice, I'll lose someone, and if I follow a different path to save them, I'll lose someone else..." I told them.
They were all silent as they waited for me to continue.
"I tried several options, but it was no use...The more I tried, the stronger the Thing became. I can't do this alone any more?--"
"You can't defeat it on your own? Then how did you do it until now?" Prussia cut in.
I thought carefully. "When it was necessary to fight... I defeated itwith Italy and Germany... and with you. I also fought alongside Russia and China--"
Prussia crossed his arms and questioned my loss for words. "Huh! Why did you stop there?!"
"I-I'm sorry." I looked away.
"You tried several options, right? But did you talk to anyone about it before you tried them? Do you really think you can come up with a solution all on your own when this fight involves so many people?" Prussia said, making his point.
"Oh..." I said as I turned to him again.
"You should have said something before! But I'm glad you told me! Kesese!" Prussia grinned before turning to _____. "....As for you, ______."
"...I...I'm not sure if I can tell you guys..." she turned away, not meeting his gaze.
He then placed his hands gently on her shoulders and spoke, "_____...you can tell us.. If there is something that you know you can't do alone, we're here. We're all here together. We can help you, frau. Trust us."
She looked up and thought for a moment before speaking.
"....I don't know if you'll believe me. That...ain't...mhmm.. it's quite a long story." she told us in an unsure tone.
Prussia shook his head and lifted her chin to face him. "Nonsense! We'll be hanging on your every word. We'll believe you. We promise."
She took a deep breath then spoke, ".....This world... I'm...I'm pretty sure I don't belong here."
"What do you mean by that?" I asked, creasing my forehead.
"From the world I lived in...you guys...are just fiction. You're all from an anime called, "Hetalia". It's one of my favourite animes.. And this...situation we're in...this is supposed to be a fanmade game." she told us slowly.
Prussia looked at her unbelievably and took a step back. "....N-No way! We can't be...this is all real... That's not..."
____ seemed to be hurt from what Prussia said, so she turned away from us.
"...I knew you'd never believe me."
I tried to comfort her by speaking up, "You've got it wrong, _____-chan. It...might be a bit hard to process...but if you say that that's the truth...we believe you. Right, Prussia?"
"Ja... I'm sorry about my reaction...But...uhm, I believe you...yet, I'm still sorta confused." Prussia apologised.
_____ has still not turned around to face us, but she spoke.
"Prussia. Eastern part of Germany. Birthday: January 18. Height: 177 cm. Born to fight the same type of battles as Austria, but was a hooligan who did nothing but fight and avoided any marriage. He will do anything to become strong, and has an arrogant attitude, believing that he is more "awesome" than others, although he hasn't really succeeded at his goal."
