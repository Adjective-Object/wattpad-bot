Percy's POV

Me and Annabeth-I'm sorry-  Annabeth and I (Wisegirl's rubbing off on me) - were walking out of my cabin. We were headed to our activities together -me at sword fighting with the Apollo cabin and her going with the Athena campers to archery (thank the gods I wasn't going there too).
Let me introduce myself-I'm Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon. I've Olympus twice and been kidnapped by Hera and retrieved Zeus' Lightning Bolt and been to the Sea of Monsters-this list could go all day... Anyways, I'm apparently a hero of Camp Half-Blood but I feel like I get to much attention. Annabeth's my girlfriend and she helped saved the world too. We survived Tartarus together and I can't imagine possibly living without her... What's she doing in my cabin? Well... Since Tartarus we get these flashbacks and we wake up in the middle of the night screaming until we see each other so Chiron figured we have to stay in the same cabin.
I noticed something weird, "Annabeth, why are we getting strange looks from so many campers? They look like they're trying to say, 'Why were you still here? We don't need you here!'"
She leaned her head on my shoulder, "I don't know Seaweed Brain, they're acting like we're ghosts!" Suddenly our friends came up to us-everyone from Rachel Elizabeth Dare to Reyna Availa Ramirez-Arellano! I heard small bits of their sentences like, "What do we do?", and "We were betrayed!" And the weird one of all, "I guess that means no more enchiladas..."-Grover for fact.
I asked my bro Jason Grace what's up with everyone today. "Dude, we were betrayed! Chiron says can't stay in Camp Half-Blood any more but he didn't give a reason. He just said Zeus ordered him too!"
I was mad... This was my home! They can't kick me out! I told them,  "We need to have a little 'talk' with Zeus..."

I hope you liked that first dramatic chapter to start us off... Don't forget to vote and comment and stuff! Have a great day!
