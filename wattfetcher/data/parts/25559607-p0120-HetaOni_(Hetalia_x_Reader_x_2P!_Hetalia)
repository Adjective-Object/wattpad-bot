---CHAPTER IX: Phone Calls (Part 4)---

//Reader's PoV//

////"Thanks...Ollie."

"Don't mention it, poppet. ....Take care."

"....You, too."


At that, I walked through the mirror."////


The next thing I knew, I was standing on the tiled floor of the first floor's bathroom. I staggered a bit, maybe from the weird feeling of actually being magically transported from one room to another by...mirror. Slowly, I turned around to face my reflection, expecting Oliver to be seen on the other side. He wasn't, though. It was only my reflection. The image of the (age)-year old me in a not-so-peachy condition. Puffy eyes from crying, hair a bit disheveled from being blindfolded...not to mention the oh-so-wonderful cut on my cheek, courtesy of Mr. Luciano Vargas.


I lifted my hand up to my face and gently felt the cut. It didn't sting as much as before, but it still hurt if you put too much pressure on it. I gave a heavy sigh and glanced at the door. Once I'm out of here, I will no longer be safe.


Not only do I have to get up to the second floor while avoiding those random alien monsters, but I also have to be wary of the other 2Ps. If they see me, it'll be a death sentence.


Walking towards the door, I remembered that I could check where the 1Ps were at at the moment. I stopped walking and waved my hand in front of me, as I always did.

The game screen displayed the countries gathered around the area where the burnt rope ladder was. It seems they are in a conversation with someone above them, sitting on their supposed-to-be exit.


"That idiot...I didn't know he could be that stupid." a brown haired, amber-eyed man with a thick Italian accent that sounded a bit lower than Italy's. Hold on...that's....that's Romano!


Clutching my head a bit, I started to remember this part of the game wherein Romano and Spain arrive at the mansion, in search of Italy and the others.


France tilted his head. "What, you already get what's going on? All we told you is that Italy locked us up and left on his own..."


Spain nodded and placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. "Yeah, I don't really get it, either, but it looks like he shares some memories with Ita."
