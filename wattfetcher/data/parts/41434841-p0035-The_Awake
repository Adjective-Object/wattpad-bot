I will miss so many simple things. The Sunday morning rainfall. My soft sheets. My younger siblings. How my dad asks if I want an egg every morning even though he knows I don't. My every other week visits to my biodad's house. The smell of fabric softener in the laundry room. My grandmothers fresh baked oatmeal cookies. The ones with the walnuts. The crazy faces I share across the room with my dad. Mr. West's hair ruffle thing he always does to me. Thunderstorms. The soft ones. With minimal thunder and cold rain and tons of lightning. My dogs. My flute. I hate it but I enjoy it. Birds. Temporary tattoos of all things. Those half melted chocolate bars my cousin gets me sometimes. My beanie babies. Especially the fox. Jordan's sarcasm. Just anything about Jordan I guess. Going out to the movies. The feel of a button up shirt and my tight binder. Smiling. Laughing. Hugs. Scented candles. Midsummers night especially. Stars. Overcast days. Talks about life and the future. My lizard. My room. My favorite pair of vans. All the friends I lost along the way. Pancakes. Those people that hold your hand and rub the back of it with their thumb. Sweaters fresh out of the drier on winter days. Tea. My sister's sweet kisses. Even if they're mostly slobber.
Just so many silly things.
