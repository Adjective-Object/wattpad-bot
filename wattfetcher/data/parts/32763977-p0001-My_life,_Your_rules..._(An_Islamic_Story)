Assalamualaikum my lovely readers! First of all, I would like to say a massive thank you for giving this book a chance, Insha'Allah I won't dissapoint you. Hopefully you will enjoy reading this book as much I love writing it!
Don't forget to
- Ignore Mistakes, sometimes I don't have the time to read over my work (or I'm just being lazy!!)
- Vote, it really motivates me when readers vote for my work!
- Comment, (that would be awesome!)
- Share! (That would be nice!)
- I will hopefully update twice a week, if not then at least once a week. (Maybe three updates if I'm in a really good mood!)
Once again, THANKS FOR READING!!
