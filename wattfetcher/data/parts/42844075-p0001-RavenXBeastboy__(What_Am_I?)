-Ravens pov-Today I am leaving the Titans for about a week or so. My father has summoned a Verdehile, a huge white haired vampire with fire powers, and forced me to move out of the Titans tower. Oooh. Sooo fun. "Hey, Rave! What's up?" Beastboy says to me, wagging his tail in the form of a dog.-Silence-"Raven?" "What." I say, annoyed."What's wrong? You seem.... uhhh.... p-paler...? Heh.." He stutters and faces me , running his hand through his hair."I'm leaving. My dad has brought a monster to kick me out of the tower for a week. As you can tell I'm a little pissed." I say to him, squinting my eyes and picking up my bags. "You can't leave Mama!" Beastboy shouts, and draws attention to me as I start to open a portal. Beastboy starts to lick my face with his dog tongue. "Eew! Beastboyyy!" I exclaim, my eyes turning red and into the form of a demon. "Okay okay I'm sorry!" He throws up his small hands into salute and Robin rushes in with Cyborg and Starfire together. "What's all this commotion?" Robin says, stepping forward to face me. "I'm leaving. Long story." I say.Robin stares at his feet."I'm gonna miss you R-raven."oh great. now Robin is gonna miss me. I wonder why me not Starfire? Than I realize Cyborg making Starfire laugh and giving her flowers. her bright green eyes gleaming. "Sorry Robin..." I whisper quietly and go into my portal.I have still got a long way to go.
-Beastboys pov-Raven is leaving today, and I'm sad. I will miss her lots,, missing her funny insults and her somewhat smiles. Smiles you have to pay for.
