Hi, i'm really happy you chose to read this book. Makes me proud. This is my first Larry book. Description might not say much but in my POV i like this book. I worked hard on it getting a hand from a lovely friend Suzzanne she helped a lot. Thanks love. Don't forget to leave opinion at the end of each chapter and a vote if you'll like =)
