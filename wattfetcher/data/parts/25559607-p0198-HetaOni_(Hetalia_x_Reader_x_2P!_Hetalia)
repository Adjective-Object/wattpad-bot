......Everything they told me......




....Everything about my parents being captive.....




.....They were all.....





.....lies?....




It.....was.....all.................





Unknowingly, tears formed in my eyes and began streaming down my cheeks. I turned around and met the gazes of the countries around me, both 1Ps and 2Ps. I was silent for a while, clenching my fists and shaking uncontrollably...not from fear, from sadness, from confusion....




.....but from.....anger.




My eyes searched for a certain auburn haired, magenta eyed, Italian...who was looking away from me the whole time. I sharply took in a breath and spoke,



"....Luciano....my....parents....aren't inside this mansion, aren't they?"



He gave a heavy sigh and faced me. "...................Si...."




"What?! I thought they were inside that sack---" Gilen exclaimed, pointing at the sack a few feet away from us.




Luciano gave him a deadly glare and answered, "--Do not dare open that sack if you value your life." he then turned to me and spoke softer, "....Your parents...are actually outside. They never....they never entered the mansion.... It was just you..."



"Then.....then...." my mind was going haywire now, I walked swiftly towards the Italian 2P and grabbed both his sleeves and shook him. "Then...that means....all this time......you were lyingÂ to me?!!!"
