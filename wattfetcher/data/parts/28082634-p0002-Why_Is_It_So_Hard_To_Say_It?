There he was, green eyes, brown, curly hair and a huge smile through his face, his eyes shined like stars. There was something about him that made my heart go crazy, the way he looked at everything, the way he smiled... Just him.
I was too distracted and i didnt see another boy of the school entering the store. He saw me and smiled in a terrible way (he did that everytime he saw me) "hi Tomlinson! What a suprise" he said
"Hi" i said and i continued walking.
"So the baby doesnt want to talk huh? Awh thats pitty... So pitty" he said smiling that awful way.
"Leave me alone" i said.
"You know you are already alone" he continued "your brother left, we all know your father hates you... Umm oh yeah, where's your mom?"
"Shes death, you know it" i said, the most calm i could.
"Oh, she's death?" he said and then smiled "or you killed her?" emphasazing the word.
"I didnt kill anyone!" i said.
"Oh c'mon Tomlinson! We all know she died in your birth, she couldnt handle you, you killed her being born, idiot" he said as he pushed me.
Suddely a different voice spoke up "stop it! Just stop it! What did he do? Absolutely nothing".
It was the curly-haired boy.
