Feeling guilty, Germany looked at Italy. "I'm sorry. even though I couldn't have known...So, what should we do now?"


"Well, first we have to go back to our world! But if we're seen by our past selves we could change the future for worse, so let's hide for a while until everyone is together again, okay?" Italy explained.


Germany looked around. "Right. so, where are we going to hide? Isn't the Thing lurking in this time loop, too?"


"Oh, it's our house, isn't it? Well...In that case, let's go to the third floor. The piano room, I did all I could to keep them from going there, so no one will show up...I think." Italy recalled.


Nodding, Germany started walking towards the stairs. "I see. Let's go, then. Even if we're found by the enemy...we'll manage somehow."



"That's right! We're pretty strong now. Let's just be careful not to be seen by our past selves." Italy smiled.

When I regained consciousness, I was surrounded by darkness.


What happened? The last thing I could remember was that I tried to go to Italy....



That's right!....


I gasped and muttered under my breath. "....Italy."



"Hmm?"Â I heard a voice.



Hold on. A voice?



I tried to move, but I was immobilised. My eyes...no...it's not really dark...



...I'm blindfolded.
