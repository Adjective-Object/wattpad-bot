"I've never got frightened that much in my whole life" Hannah breathed heavily.
I saw shame washing Jake's and Damon's faces.
Who upsets me the most is Damon. He keeps acting like he cares, like he likes me, like he worries about me, but he didn't move a finger, I thought he was different, I was about .... I was about to like him.
But, al hamdu lellah I saw his real personality.
When you look at him and see these beautiful blue eyes, that perfect messy black hair, that beautiful tanned skin, that muscular figure, the perfect face and cheek-bones, you'll fall for him. Let's be honest, that boys is attractive, any girl would be jumping if he spoke to her the way he speaks to me, he was funny and cute, but in the inside, he's nothing but mommy's little boy.
"I-I'm sorry" Damon bit his bottom lip "But you had no right to freak us" He said angrily.
"Chicken" Peter said.
"Let's just forget all of this and play something, truth or dare?" Molly changed the subject.
We all gathered around, I pushed myself between Elina and Helen.
"Spin the bottle" William said. It stopped on Jake and Diana
"Truth or dare ?" She asked him
"If he has any dare left" I mocked, they all laughed.
"Dare" Jake glared at me "Dare" He repeated.
"Hmmm, I dare you to ... Take your shirt off" She smirked.
"Piece of cake" He chuckled and winked at me "What ? No stop" I said, the girls whined so he took it off, I lowered my gaze.
"Can't take my highness' hottness" Sarcasm was dripping out of his mouth.
"I don't want my eyes to get burnt because of the smell under your arms" I mocked and everybody laughed.
"Spinn it again before these two get into another fight" Simon said.
"Truth or dare ?" Lewis asked William. "Truth" He answered.
"Which girl of these has the best body" The girls gasped.
"Since Leena is wearing over sized clothes and I couldn't see if she got curves or anything ... I'll say Hannah" Hannah blushed slightly "Uh !!! You're such a rude person" I said.
William  laughed and spinned the bottle, it stopped on me and Peter.
"Dare" I said.
"I dare you to go on a date with me" Peter smiled, I raised both of my eyebrows, everybody looked at Peter.
"What ?' Damon and Jake said in sync.
"A dare is a dare, sweetheart" He grinned.
"A dare IS a dare, and I never lose a dare, but when it conflicts with me religion I don't do it" I said
"And how does it conflict with you religion ?" He asked.
"In my eligion, We are not allowed to go on dates, to hang out with the other gender, or to do any physical contact with them. The over admixture between boys and girls isn't allowed. A girl and a boy shouldn't stay together alone, because the satan will be the third" I explained.
"But you're here, in this house talking and laughing with a group of boys and you're going to sleep here, isn't that the same thing ?" Peter chuckled.
And then it hit me ...
The world stopped for seconds ...
