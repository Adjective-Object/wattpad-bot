Haiiiii. So yea I know everyone who actually reads my stories are probably upset that I'm not continuing them, but that's because I was writing them last year and the year before. I had no clue how to write stories, but I know now. And I just wanna say the main girl character is Catie and she's also my best friend in school. Another thing is I came up with the story idea because I was writing Catie a one page story and now it's gonna be a book and a sequel. Yes I already know there's going to be a sequel because I already wrote the beginning of it. Any who read on! Baiiii
