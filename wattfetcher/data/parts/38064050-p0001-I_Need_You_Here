((Hey guys, Cal here. I'm writing this to express myself. I'm not quite as bad as I was but the feelings are slowly returning, this is my next option to chill the fuck out.))Dave's POV-
I walked out of the school, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Why look if they'll flip out and call you a demon? Heh, yeah...demon....I guess I should tell you why they call me a demon, huh?Well, I've had red eyes since I was born. I'm albino...I always wear shades to cover it but in elementary some bitch decided to take them right off my face. Lucky for me, that same bitch has been going to the same schools as me since....yay. And her being lil' miss popular, she told everyone about it and now I'm the freak of the century. Anyways, I get to my apartment and of course, Bro isn't home. I drop my shit by the front door and run off to my room.
I open my drawer and get my pocket knife. I stared at it a bit and rolled up my sleeves. I pressed the blade against my arm and slid it across slowly. It wasn't deep but it was enough to get a nice amount of blood. I did that a few more times. After about an hour of watching the blood roll down my arm, I heard the door open.
"Yo, lil' man. You home?" I heard Bro's voice. I scrambled to clean the blood up and wrap my arm. I pulled my sleeves down and walked into the living room."Sup, Bro." I tried to sound like I was fine...but of course my voice cracked.
"You okay, kid?"
((Give me feedback guys. I know it's not all that good but like I said, it's my way to cope. Should I continue?))
