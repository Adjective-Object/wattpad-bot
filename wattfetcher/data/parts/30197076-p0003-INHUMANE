A Flash of Lightning Struck Through The sky As She Quickly Spotted its Reflection On The Mansion's Downstairs Window, And It Was Almost like There Was no Life Inside.
She Felt Like She Was Almost Living A Horror Movie..
"What a rediculous Weather this is ?" She mumbled quitely under her breath. What Kind Of Storm Is This With no Rain ? Could You Even Call It A Storm With No Rain ? There wasnt even Enough Lightning to Classify as Lightning Storm And The Thunder Was Far off.
Sighing Again, She Could See Her Breath Out As A Chilly Cold Storm Before Disappearing Into Thin air. Quickly, she Started fumbling With her Keys In Her Pocket Before She Stuck Them Through the Key Hole And Entered.
As Creepily As Ever, The Door Made a Loud, Annoying Creak Sound Before She Closed It Behind her Quitely this Time Though She Wasnt Quick enough As The Howling Wind Outside Was Raging Resulting In A Big 'Thud' Sound. An Indication That The Door Was Slammed.. Hard.
She Jumped Slightly, Her Hand Reaching Up to Her Thumping Heart As She Closed Her Eyes For Some Moments, Regaining Her Breath Before She Fluttered them Open As She Heard A Small Squeak.
Her Eyes Darted Around Through The Dark, Looking For Two Things.. 1)The Light Switch Before She Dies Randomly. 2) The Baseball Bat Which She Knows Would Do Absoloutely Nothing But She Just Thought It'd Be Worth it To Give it a Try Anyway.
Well, Let's just say she chose the nearer..
The baseball bat.
As She Held Wooden thing Between Her Palms Tightly, Her Eyes Searching The Darkness For The Source And Her Ears On Full Alert.
She Felt Like She Was In a Horror Movie.. Watched..(A/N Well that was Half True, ofcourse she Was Watched, By US !!) She Felt Like She Was Watched By People As They Kept Screaming At Her Stupidly And Yelling At How Stupid She Was And How The Killer Was right behind Her..
So For Once She Decided To Take With Their Advice.
Turning Around Agonizingly Slow, Her Mouth Turned Into A Funny Grimace And Her Eyes Half Closed...
Just a Little Bit More And.....
"SWEET SIXTEEN !"
The Lights Suddenly Flickered Back On, Revealing A Huge Poster Slung From Two Sides Of A Wall With Big Fancy Bold "Sweet Sixteen" On Them And Her Full Name Right Under It.
A Huge Wave Of People Started Gathering All Aroud Her Including People From School, Her Besties And Her Family Offcourse !
Her Face Lit Up In A Silly Grin As Her Eyes Twinkled With Mischief And Happiness. There Were No More Signs Of Fear or Terror Anymore.
She Found It Hard To Say Something In The Middle Of All This Mess, People Were Cheering, Screaming, Yelling and Drinking.
As Her Eyes Wandered Around The Living Room, She Spotted A Huge Pile Of Presents Piled Up In The Corner..
Holy Chicks !
It Reached The Ceiling And Some Were Even Leaning Forward A Little, Threatning To Fall And Make a Mess.
Wow !
She Couldnt Help But Skip Over To The Pile Excitedly, As She Secretively Squeezed Through The Crowd.
Cocktail Drinks And Punch Were Being Distributed And People Were Already Getting Drunk..
Chuckling To Herself, She Wondered How Could Her Mom, Violet, Allow That ? She knew For a Fact That This Was The twins Ideas, Justin And Jayden. How Exactly Did They Manage To Bribe Dad To Brianwash Mom's Mind To Actually Accept The Idea ?
