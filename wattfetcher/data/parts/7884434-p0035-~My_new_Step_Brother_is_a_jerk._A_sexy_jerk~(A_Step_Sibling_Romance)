"Non of your buisness" I say
"Its Casper isn't it"
"Does it matter?" I say
"Yeah it does?"
"Oh well" The door bell rings and I go and answer it. Casper stands there and I smile at him.
"Casper?" I hear from behind me. I look back and see Ashley standing there.
"Ashley?" He says shocked.
"What are you doing here? And why are you near her?" She says giving me a dirty look.
Casper pulls me into him and I see Seth and Ashley give us both death glares.
"Haha Ashley looks like 2 guys left you for me. And they both want me. Still" I say with a smirk. Â She runs at me and grabs my hair pulling me to the ground. I kick and punch and she wails me in the noce. I kick her in her crotch and she winces in pain. I flip her over and punch her face and her eye.
"STOP!" She screams. I push her down and get up and I look at her lying on the ground.
"Dont fucking start a battle you cant win bitch." I say walking out and grabbing Casper and leaving.
I hope Seth gets her pregnant and hes stuck with her forever.
