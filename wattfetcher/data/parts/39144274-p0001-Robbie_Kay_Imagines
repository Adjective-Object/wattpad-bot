Request: A girl who stands up to Pan? And maybe in the end falls in love with him or something cause he's in love with her -ANON
A/N: I'm almost done. I have one more that will also be up in a while. Thanks for being patient with me.;)
-----------------------------------------------------
"Y/N!" Peter yelled at me. I have had it with his shit. He could be so... irritable sometimes. Why? I don't know, but I am done with it. He thinks he can push me around all he wants? Well... no! I'm not his! "Y/N!" he yelled again, "I've been calling you? Are you deaf? No? Good. Now, I'm hungry." He nodded towards the tent. "No." I snarled. Peter turned towards me. Oh no. Shouldn't have done that. Should not have done that. "What?" he growled sternly, his eyes growing dark as they peered into my soul. Well... can't take that back. "You heard me!" I tried making myself taller than him but damn was he tall. I clenched my jaw. God I hope I don't look like an idiot doing this. "Y/N... go." Pan said between his teeth. "No. I'm not gonna act like your little... ugh!" I had to get away from him right now. My heart is beating like... I was gonna say something witty but guess not. It was fast though. I walked through the dark trees for a while. It's already dark and man was it cold. I really should have worn a sweater or long sleeves. I walked to the edge of the cliff. Time to sit and get it all off my chest. I took in a gulp of air then screamed, "He's such an aggravating asshole!" I sighed and collapsed to the ground. "So that's what you think of me?" Great. I stood up to face him. "Yes! I'm not someone you can just push around Peter. You can do that to the boys but I'm not gonna have it! I'm not yours!" He smiled. Why is he smiling? Jerk. "Sadly." Wait... what? "Excuse me? Who do you even think y-" Holy shit... Peter is... kissing me? He pulled away. "Now will you be quiet? And I think I'm the ruler of Neverland who usually gets whatever he wants but has had a hard time getting the girl he loves." Peter walked away leaving me to my thoughts. When he was out of sight and hearing I started to process what just happened. "Did he really just k-kiss me? Wait he loves me? Why am I saying all this aloud?" I looked to my left where a rock sat. There was a blue hoodie on it. I figured it was Pan and pulled it over my head. I began to walk back to the camp, hugging my arms. God it's so cold. Why is it so cold? When I got there, everyone was asleep. I should do that too. As I walk into my tent, I see Peter walking into the forest... again. I will never understand that boy. I changed into something warm and comfortable then called it a night. All I can think about is that kiss. Did it actually mean something? Does he really... love me? A girl can hope right? SO does that mean I like him back? Oh my- why is love and life and Peter all so confusing?!?!?! I have asked a lot of questions today. Hopefully there will be none tomorrow. I closed my eyes then sleep soon consumed me.
I woke up to the sun piercing its way into my tent. No!! I don't wanna get up! Then memories decided to trample my brain. I got up still thinking about everything that had happened. It's gonna be so awkward with him now. I walked out of the camp and he was absolutely nowhere to be found. Like I said I am never gonna get that kid. I walked towards one of the boys. He was standing with Felix. "Either of you seen the great Pan?" Felix smirked at the name then shook his head. "No not since he went after you. Oh God please stop talking about it! "Right. Thanks." I sat down next to a few other boys who were messing around. Why can't there be another girl around here? Great more questions. I can't get my mind off of Pan. When he kissed me. I mean his lips were so soft and his hands are like oh my god! What the hell is wrong with me? But I mean seriously and his hair, you just wanna put your hands all over it okay! That's enough. Speaking of the devil. Here he comes. He walked past me like nothing happened. Really? Why did I get so nervous because of that? It's just Peter! Maybe I do like him. Why else would I get so nervous around him and feel this way? What if he doesn't really love me and I make an fool of myself telling him that I love him? Screw it!!
I walked into Peter's tent. "What are you doing here?" he whispered, his gaze shifting around everywhere but me. Common Y/N! Man up about this! That's really not gonna help. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. "Look. I don't know what last night was all about, but it got me thinking. A lot. And I-I don't know I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you said that thing, I realized that I- I oh my god whatever... I love you to-" Before I could finished my last word. I felt his lips on my again. Our lips moved in sync as if they were made for each other. Clich√©? I know but it's how I feel. "I love you Y/N. I can't express how much." He whispered as if his words would hurt me. "I love you too."
