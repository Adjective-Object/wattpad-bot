"No thanks, I live right around the corner. I'll call you tomorrow." He smiled.
Savannah pulled out and Trevor walked home. It was only the two of us now and I was suddenly nervous. I wondered if I made the right decision to stay. I stopped doubting myself and just went with it. I found myself staring at the ground.
"Come on, let's go back to the beach." He said and I followed him. I caught up to him and intertwined our fingers. We walked down the path for final time tonight and went back to the private part of the beach. The blanket and pillow was still there untouched. I let go of his hand as he sat down on the blanket. I was hesitant deciding on whether to sit or not but I realized I looked stupid just standing there so I sat down. I took off my heels that I'd been wearing all night and laid back trying to relax. He laid next to me silently. It was complete silence for a while, all you heard were the waves crashing and the wind blowing. I decided to turn on my side and move closer towards Jack. I wrapped my arm around his waist and stayed silent. He turned and kissed the top of my head.
"What was that for?" I asked.
"No reason." He smiled.
I sat up but he pulled me back down and rolled onto his side hugging me from behind. "Dont go." He whispered. I turned around to face him and rested my head on his chest. "I didn't plan on it." I whispered. I closed my eyes hoping to fall asleep but I couldn't. He lifted my head up and kissed me gently like he has been wanting to do that all night. I deepened the kiss. He pulled away "What was that for?" He asked surprised. "No reason." I smiled and rested my head lightly on his chest again. He hugged me tighter and I felt the heat coming off of his body. I felt safe and protected again. This was the best night of my life and I didn't want it to end but sadly it did and we were both sound asleep.
