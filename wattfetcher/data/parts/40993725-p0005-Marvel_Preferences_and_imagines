I  looked down at my belly. I was 8 months pregnant with Steve Rogers baby. I rub a hand over the gigantic bump, and smile down. I was so happy.   Steve places his big hand next to mine and leans on shoulder as i hum Safe and Sound by Taylor Swift.  "Come on baby girl, kick for daddy!" Steve said rubbing his hand back and forth on my bump. He smiles bigger than the moon when our little girl kicks roughly on the place his hand was.   "Darn it Steve! Now she wont stop!" I complained to him, leaning to his touch.   "Sorry Babe, but at least we know she's healthy!" Steve replied grinning down at me. He does that alot now. Even the other avengers noticed. He leaned down and kissed me, before leaning down and kissing our daughter.    "Listen up, don't give mommy heck, okay Baby?" My husband whispers as he pecks my belly again and going off to do something. I smile out the window, and reflect how there was nothing that could make my life better.
