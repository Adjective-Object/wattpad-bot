[Milla POV]
Well, first time on a plane; not so bad.... "Hey Caleb, are you nervous?" I asked. "Uhhhhh... No. I'd be a Nervous wreck if they didn't have Starbucks in Bristol London." He answered. Heh, him an his Starbucks.... "Milla, don't tell me your bored already?" Mayme asked sarcastically. "What?! How did you know? " I asked a little surprised. " well, you usually stare of into places or push buttons...." Mayme said. (A/n: that's true about me) "well....." I said. I got out my art book an Caleb immediately turns to a Steven universe picture I drew. "YES! Pearl! Can I have this picture? " he asked. "Sure, go ahead. I'm still working on lapis for ya too." I said.

Heh, Caleb an his pearl.... I wonder if I should try drawing Steven universe..... Gah, who cares. "Mayme, truth or dare?" I asked. "Really Bobbie? It's usually Milla asking, but now you? Well.... Truth" Mayme said, "Mayme, is it true that your in love with captain sparklez?" I asked. Mayme nearly blushes as red as fire. "U-um.... NO!" Mayme said. "Really? You think we'll fall for that?" Gabe said sarcastically. "Shadddaup gabe...." Mayme said annoyed.•••
