"Shut up and leave me alone!" He pushes her to the side and grabs my arm and pulls me along with him.
"God she's such a slut. Can I get away from her already!"
"Just keep walking, and your hurting me Luke."
"I'm so sorry. Sorry for her calling you a side bitch and not pretty. Don't believe her, please."
"I won't, just for you." he's so kind and caring. How could he have dated a hateful person like her? We walk farther and we get to the shop and Luke guides me in through the tall guys.
Luke eventually finds some underwear and a beanie that looks nice on him.
"Hey go try this on!" He asks as he hands me a pair of underwear.
"Uh that's for guys, not girls!"
"Just do it! It'll be funny!"
"Uh fine!" I take the blue plaid boxers and head to the dressing room. At first Luke followed in the room with me until I shoved him out. Weirdo! I close the door and take off my shoes then my leggings. I decide to keep my underwear on and put the boxers on over them. Once I did I stepped out and Luke was right in from of the door with his phone out.
"Smile!" Might as well. I through up a peace sign and stick my tongue out and he takes the picture.
"Let me see!" Holy crap I look weird!
"And this is why boxers are for guys! Told you so!"
"Okay okay! Go get changed and we'll head somewhere else."
We finished our business there and move towards The food court to depart.
"I had fun today with you Alex. We should hang out again."
"Yeah that was fun! I'll see you later Luke."
"Ill text you okay?" Then he was gone in the sea of people. He is always good company when I need.
I drive home and it's already 4! How long was I gone for ? Either way mom started making dinner and I was a little hungry. I heard my phone ring, so I unlock it to see Luke's number with a picture of me from American Apparel. I laugh out loud a little and saved it. I text him back saying thanks and he sends a smilie face. I am really liking Sydney more and more each day.
