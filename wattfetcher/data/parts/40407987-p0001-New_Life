~I advise you to read this or you will be really confused or irritated by the way I write this story, thank you!~
There are a few things you should know before reading;
1) I DON'T OWN GLEE OR ANY SONGS MENTIONED. I ALSO DON'T OWN ANY CHARACTERS APART FROM RACQUEL HARDACRE OR ANY OTHERS I WILL MENTION. ALONG WITH BACKSTORIES OF THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS IF NONE WAS MADE FOR THEM
2) All the characters grades are the same as the show
3) This is set during the First Time episode, but some episodes are more spread out.
4)Bear in mind this will all be taking place November - May 2012, so there will be no recent songs or slang. Also that this whole book takes place in only Season 3 of Glee
5) This story isn't completely accurate to the show, but I will keep the major issues accurate
6) I do write the lyrics out, but I also put the video on most. MOST performances/songs have some characters replaced mainly in the Michael episode, along with my own performances
7) This story will include swearing, semi-sexual scenes and themes that aren't too kind for some readers. BRACE YOURSELF
8) If anything is misspelled or bad grammar please let me know so I can improve and change it.
9)The characters will not all be saying things word to word in each episodes, but most will.
10)If you have any suggestions for the title, let me know. This story is a working progress
11) FINAL NOTE: One character does have a sexuality change, but you'll figure it out.
That is all, and I hope you ENJOY the story!
