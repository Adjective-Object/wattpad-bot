She might save lives for fun, you know? It might be a hobby?
Mystery girl was right. He needed to pay attention to chemistry. The formulae and elements were not going to walk into his brain by choice. He had to force them in, and then lock the door, so they can't get out. He looked ahead and saw Abrielle, his worst enemy's ugly blonde hair. Okay, maybe her hair wasn't that bad. Jake looked down, trying to control the urge to touch and sniff her hair because that would be creepy. It has happened on several different occasions, but she was annoying and bratty. And he didn't like her. He didn't like her hair either. No matter how soft and touchable it looked.

Happiness is a choice, not a result. Nothing will make you happy until you choose to be happy. No person will ever make you happy, until you choose to be happy unless you decide to be happy. Your happiness will not come to you. It can only come from you.
