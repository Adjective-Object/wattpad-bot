Let's talk business now. This chapter is highly based on the last one. However, please note what is said in the dialogue, stays in the dialogue. Part is true and the others are.....
Now, especially in this chapter, I need to explain how the school is. To understand, you must at least be on the Fishman Island Arc but even the Skypiea Arc is good too.
On the surface, the school is located at Sabody and remember that Sabody has different mangroves connected by bridges. Yeah, in this book. The entire Sabody Archipelago is the school and dorms.
Haruka and the others live on an Sky Island that is directly above the school is connected to the main school via the Cloud Sea and Sea Trains. There are only dorms here.
Directly below the Sabody Archipelago is the Fishman High located 10,000 ft below sea level. Though not necessarily important now but its good to know.
On to the story!
This chapter might be in two parts.
============================
It was a Friday morning. That day, Mihawk sent his entire Spanish and P.E Class to a resort, as he stated, 'He wanted to get rid of these brats for a day."
So everyone was busy packing for a day vacation at a Famous beach resort at Spa Island.
"There, I done!" Sakura cheered having finished her suitcase. That day, she was wearing a mini pink tube top and on top of that was a green spaghetti shirt with the Crimin logo on it. She also wore a yellow skirt and flip-flops. She let her strawberry blonde hair loose with the only thing holding it in place which is a pink hair band.
"Took you long enough." Haruka spat. He was wearing a tight fitting vest which showed his well muscled chest. With that, he wore a black khaki pants.
"Really. That was the best you found?" Sakura asked looking at Haruka.
"I gotta impress the fan girls." Haruka stated, doing his signature pose: passing his hand through his hair.
Sakura just gave him a face that said, 'So what?'. "Not like I would be impressed anyway. I've seen better." She said to him.
Haruka merely looked at her before muttering something about he needing to find Aya. As soon as he left...
"Ahh~ Why does he of all people have to be so frickin' sexy?" Sakura asked herself before rolling on her bed. She stopped with her face planted on the bed before exhaling. She then looked at a picture she had of Ace and Luffy when their class visited a Marine ship.
"I'm taking a selfie!" Sakura muttered to herself, holding the camera in front her.
"Me too!" Luffy shouted before photo-bombing the picture. At what time Ace invaded the picture, she's not sure but all she know she loves it.
She was in the centre. Luffy was on her right doing a peace sign and Ace did the same thing except this time, on her right.
"That was a good day~" Sakura sighed before giving in to the softness of her bed.
"What you're doing?" Aya asked looking at her.At that time, Aya wore a pink bikini top with yellow strips. She had sunglasses in her hair which was kept in a ponytail. She had a pink beach wrap with flowers wrapped around her waist and she had pink sandals. Because of her devil fruit, Aya's skin had a pinkish tint to it.
"N-Nothing." Sakura answered, holding the picture close to her chest with some pink dusting her cheek.
