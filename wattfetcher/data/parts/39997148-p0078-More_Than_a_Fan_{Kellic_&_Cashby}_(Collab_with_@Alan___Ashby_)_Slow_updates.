"Whatever."
"You two are perfect for each other." Erin said.
"Whatever." I said again. "I don't even know how I put up with him. He's a little shit to me most of the time."
"I am not!"
"You threatened to kill me like twenty minutes ago!"
"Well maybe you shouldn't have bugged me."
"Well I was bored and the guys were too busy freaking out about the girls coming to entertain me. Not to mention they broke the game console."
"Still shouldn't have bothered me."
"If you don't stop I'm going to bug you while you're trying to run the merch table tomorrow night." I told him poking his side.
"Don't do that you just get in the way."
"Exactly." I said smugly.
He rolled his eyes at me.
"Don't you roll your eyes at me young man." I told him and he rolled them again. "Stop it."
"No."
I glared at him and crossed my arms, "I don't like you."
"Yes you do."
"Well not anymore I don't."
"Liar."
"Oh my god they are perfect for each other." Erin said watching us bicker.
"Kellic all the way." Alysha said.
"Better than Fuenciado." Jess said, "Much better."
"I agree with that." Jaime said.
"You better agree with that or else you and I are going to be having some problems." She told him.
"Well I agree, I agree."
"Good." She said smiling, "But back to Kellic. I ship it."
"Who doesn't ship it."
"Well I know one person who doesn't." Tony said laughing.
"Who?"
"Jonny."
"Well fuck him, he's an asshole." Kellin said venomously.
"Someone jealous?" I asked chuckling.
"Very."
"Well don't be." I told him patting his leg. He rolled his eyes and changed the subject, we wound up talking for another hour before all of the guys eagerly took their girlfriends out on dates and shit.
"Thank god they all got hotel rooms for the night." I said sighing in relief after they all left.
Kellin looked at me, "Yeah it probably would have been a noisy night."
"Let's not even talk about it." I said shuddering.
Kellin rolled his eyes, "Whatever. I'm going to my bunk."
"No you're not. Tell me what's going on. I don't like seeing you all pissy."
"I don't want to talk about it. You're just going to think I'm being whiny." He said and stood up.
"Nope, we're talking about it." I told him and grabbed his hand pulling him back to me.
"I don't want to."
"Come on Kells."
