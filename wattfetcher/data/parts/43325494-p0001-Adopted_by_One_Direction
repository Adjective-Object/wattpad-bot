Hi my name's Keila Eden Carrasco but people call me Aiden because, well I like that name.I am 14 years old.I have a weird imagination.I like candy and get super hyper when I eat or drink something with sugar.
I am a very shy person with new people.I act like I'm mean so people won't come near me.I only trust three people and they are my best friends.There names are Nicholas but I call him Turtle he is 15(I may or may not have had a crush on him since I was 10.)
There is my other friend George he is 14 and my friend Billie who is also 14.We are the 'bad kids' here.We met when I first came to the orphanage.I don't like talking to people I don't know. and I have social anxiety.
I have been living in the same orphanage ever since I was five.We have never been adopted. Well except for this one time when George almost got adopted but he was so scared that he threw up on them.Funniest day ever the lady got so mad because her purse was ruined.
