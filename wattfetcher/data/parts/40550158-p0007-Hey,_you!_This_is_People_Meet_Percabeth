All around Percy water rose up towering thousands of feet high and hurricanes surrounded Percy. The ground trembled beneath Percy's power and everybody ran away. except for one person. Annabeth. She walked up to Percy and whispered in his ear then kissed him. Soon enough the water flowed back into its place and the hurricanes stopped. The ground stopped shaking and Percy and Annabeth pulled away. Percy's eyes were their usual color and he whispered something into Annabeths eyes. Annabeth threw her head back laughing and said "Seaweed Brain"
"But I'm your Seaweed Brain," Replied Percy smugly
Annabeth just rolled her eyes and took Percy's hand. They started to run away from where everyone watched uncertain to what just happened. Though Percabeth didn't say where they were going, both Greeks and Romans knew (thanks to the Aphrodite kids). They were going to where it all started: the beach.
