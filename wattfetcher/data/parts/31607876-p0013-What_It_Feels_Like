"Your mental health comes before school baby, always. If it's midnight, and you have an exam the next day but your hands have been shaking for the past hour and a half and you're not so sure you want to be alive anymore, pull out that carton of Ben and Jerry's and afterwards, go the fuck to bed. So what if you get a 68% on the exam the next day? You took care of yourself and at the end of the day that will always come before a high test score. To hell with anyone who tells you differently."
-Abbie Nielsen, Dear Future Daughter
(Just want to say this is so important. My mom never says this to me and that's one of the reasons why I feel the need to cut myself; she would rather I have cuts and a good test grade than the other way around. But if school is killing you--well, what good will your schooling be if you're dead?)
