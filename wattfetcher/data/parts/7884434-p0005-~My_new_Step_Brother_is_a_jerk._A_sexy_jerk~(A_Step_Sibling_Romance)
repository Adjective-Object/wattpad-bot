"Your weird" I said getting up. I started stacking boxes neatly into the corner of my bedroom. I think it will be easier for the movers to colect.
"Damn this box is heavy! Seth can you help me?" I asked looking over at him. He was laying on my bed. Supporting his weight on his elbows. Thats when I realized my back was facing him and he was staring at my ass! "Your such a pervert!" I said with a skreetch.
"Nice ass Â Shea. Didn't realize until you bent over. I like that position" He winked.
"Help me!!!" I said trying to pick up the box again.
"Okay fine" He said with a chuckle. He walked over to the box and picked it up like it weighed nothing!
"How did you do that?" I asked shocked
"Its called strength baby, something you obviously don't have" I melted when he called me baby. Danm him!
'Don't call me that!" I said angrily
"Why cause you like it?" He asked with a smug grin
"No it actually discusts me" I said with a shrug. I wasn't letting him win. I turned back around and walked over to another box. I was tired and just stood there looking at it.
Seths arms wrapped around my waist and I tensed. "Sure it does. Wy so tense? Nervous?" He asked with a chuckle.
"Let go of me Seth" I said sternly
"Nah i'm good. I like this position" He said holding me tighter.
"And why do you like this position?" I asked
"Because. I'm taking a liking to you" Oh my god. He did not just say that.
"Screw off" I said trying to get out of his grip.
"You see I would happily screw, but not get off. I want to listen to you moan my name, scream it. I want to feel your kitten tighten around me. I want to feel all of you. Thats all I want" He said in my ear. My hole body tingeling. I was not giving in to him.
"I'm not being a good fuck for you. Sorry. Go find some girl who would actually want to fuck you. I don't and never will. Sorry to burst yo- OH!" He pushed his erection against my bum.
"Yeah sure you don't. That is what you do to me" He relased me and went and sat on my bed.
"Your an asshole" I spat t him.
"I'll be naything you want me to be baby" He said suductivly. How the hell am I suposed to live with this asshole.
"I hate you!" I said glaring at him.
He chuckled. "Baby me and you both know you don't hate me. You want me. Its obvious. Every girl does" He said with a smirk.
"If any good looking guy wanted sex all the girls would be there begging him to have their way with him. Its sad actually. Good thing i'm still a virgin. I'm saving myself" I said. "So you have no chance" I said with a smug grin.
He got up and walked towards me. I backed up and hit the wall. His hands on either side of my head. He leaned in and his lips hovered over mine. "We will see about that Shea. I always get what I want, and I want you" His lips brushing up against mine. I wanted to kiss him but I didn't. I wasn't giving in.
"Your going to be my Step Brother. Its wrong"
"Honey its not wrong until they get married" He said resting his forehead against mine. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.
"I don't want you Seth. Get off of me" I said calmly.
