Jordan's POV
I stayed at Erin's last night and when I woke up, I had my arm around her and her head was in my neck. We talked for a bit after she woke up.
We got up and so did Boo.
"Jordan!" Boo screamed.
"Hey, kid!" I said when she ran twards me and jumped into my arms.
"Jordan came last night, did you know that?" Erin asked.
"Yeah, he came and kissed my head." She said.
"Oh, you were awake?" I asked.
"Yeah." She responded.
I put her down and Erin and I went to the kitchen to make breakfast.
"She was awake?" Erin asked.
"I guess so." I answered.
"Wow." She said.
Boo's POV
Jordan came over and kissed me and my mommy's heads last night. I like Jordan, he's funny.
Mommy thinks he's funny too, maybe he'll be my new daddy.
Erin's POV
I can tell Boo likes it when Jordan comes over, she's always hugging him before hugging me when he's there.
"I don't think I have ever gotten a hug from her before she hugged you." I said.
"Really? Huh." He said.
"I think she wants us to get married... I think. She said it once." I said while looking in his eyes. We were making pancake batter together. I was mixing it and he came up from behind and "helped me", he grabbed my hand and mixed too.
"Hmm." I chuckled as I scrunched my nose.
"Yeah, I know." He said knowing I was about to tell him I love him.
"You're so cute." I said.
"Yeah, I know." He said again before we laughed and kissed eachother.
"Eww." Boo said as she entered the room.
"Hey, you wanna help?" Jordan asked.
"Sure, as long as you don't do that again." She said.
I laughed and we both knelt down and kissed her head making her stop walking and scream. "Ahh, why did you do that too me?" She asked.
"Cause you're a cute little kid." I said.
"I agree." He said.
"Also, I wanted to annoy you." I said.
"Well, it worked." She said in a nasty voice.
"Is that how you should talk to your mother? You know, the one that gave you life." Jordan said.
"No, sorry mommy." She said while hugging me.
"You should be glad you have such a cute kid." Jordan said.
