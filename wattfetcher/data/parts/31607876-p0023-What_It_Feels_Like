Have you ever noticedThe bags under her eyesOr the anger issuesThat she has?
Her hollow cheeksAnd cracked lipsStill forced into a smile. Struggling to show everyone That she's a fighterThat she will be alright.
No one botheredTo hold her close, to tell herThat it's okay not toBe fine.
So she breathed through her whole lifeAs if it were a battlefieldAnd wished that one day she would liveand not just survive.
