"Fucking touch me, and I will kill you," she threatened, sliding her designer sunglasses up her nose and stomping hard enough on the cement so you could hear the clacking as she walked. Flashing lights and the smell of weed ambushed Chloe's nose as she tried to slide into the car, her head ducked. Her heel attached itself to a orangish-yellow piece of chewed up gum, an irritated groan escaping the singer's lips as she yanked her foot off the disgusting gob.
"Chloe! Look here, babe."
"Is it true that you just dumped Jake Ryan for your longtime best friend, Smith Henry?"
"Smile for the camera, baby!"
"Chloe, is Jake Ryan the inspiration for you're new single?"
The blonde felt the hot lights in front of her face, turning her head away from the lenses so her long hair would cover her face. A large hand touched the girl's shoulder, escorting her into the vehicle and seeing the other hand guard her from the rest of the paparazzi. There were about fifty screaming girls, waving there iPhones and silver sharpies in the air. Chloe's name was being worn out by the greasy men holding DLSRs and wanting information and some twenty year old guys who wanted her number.
She simply shut the heavy, black door, pleased with the tinted car windows, shielding her from all the cameras. The banging on the car door moved to the trunk, until it was completely gone, peace and serenity taking over her current environment. Chloe's driver, Carlos, reached for the radio knob, turning it to the right. The first 'Hey!' played, and he immediately changed the station to some indie channel. He knew better than to let their music play.
"Ms. Gosselin. Where would you like to go this evening?" Carlos spoke, his tired eyes caught her brown ones through the rearview mirror. Carlos's were a very dark brown, kind of like dark coffee or burnt bark as Chloe's was more of a brown sugar. He always seemed so poised and awake, but his eyes were just exhausted, and it really did worry the girl. The fame never really did take her heart, no matter what the media said.
Chloe's nimble hands slipped the shiny, new, black pumps off her feet, them aching from the dancing. She, honestly, couldn't wait to play tug of war with the leather body con and her body because it was so difficult to slip into. It was gonna be hell taking it off. She silently cursed Courtney for forcing her to wear it to Haley's party. The old man rose his eyebrows at the young girl as she quietly sat in the back seat. He was silently asking her why Jake wasn't there, trying to attach his lips to her neck, like it happened after every party. Even though he treated Chloe like his distant boss, Carlos still cared a ton. You could just tell by the way he blocked off the paps and how his eyes were so expressive when the two spoke.
"Carlos, I told you," Chloe laughed, shaking her blonde head at the carpeted flooring of the vehicle. When he called her that, it made her feel old. Courtney was 'Ms. Gosselin,' she was Chloe, just Chloe. "Just call me Chloe. And just home, please."
"Home it is, Ms. Gosselin," he said, a small grin growing onto his chapped lips. Carlos had been the blonde's driver for the past year and a half, now, and he was still exactly the same. His hair was more gray than when she first met him, however, and he was less formal with Chloe since their first conversation. The two had an odd relationship. She liked to think that they were somewhat like Joseph and Mia from The Princess Diaries, but she prayed that she looked better than her in the beginning of the first film.
"Carlos, you do know that you had this entire week off?" She laughed, eyeing the old man through the mirror. His head turned just so she was in his peripheral vision and nodded his semi bald head. He never skipped a day of work, always at her house at eight in the morning to drive her wherever she requested.
Her eyes wandered the busy LA freeways, street lights looking like a bokeh effect in videos. Chloe had a great admiration for Los Angeles. She enjoyed the whole thought of the city, it being just the perfect temporary. You were never tied down to the city. People came from everywhere else, and the locals left. You go to LA for the thrill of night adventures and crazy parties, not for a nice, big house where you raise your five year old and paint your picket fence white.
