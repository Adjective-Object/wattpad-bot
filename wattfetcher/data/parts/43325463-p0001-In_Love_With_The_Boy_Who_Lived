I'm Piper Lockwood. My parents are talking with some wizards they met. My parents are muggles and were quite surprised when they found out I was a witch.I was quite surprised too, I mean I always thought I was an ordinary girl. My thought were interrupted by my mum.
"According to those very kind Wizards over there," my mom pointed to a family of redheads, "You are supposed to rin through that to get to the other side." She pointed to a brick wall between platforms nine and ten. Oh, so that must be platform nine and three quarters. I guess that makes sense. "Ok." I responded.
"We will be right behind you Piper." My Father said, with a reassuring smile. I smiled back to show I was fine. I took a deep breath then started running towards the platform. I closed my eyes ready for the crash, but it never came. I opened my eyes and gasped. The view was amazing. There was a scarlet red train infront of me. It was breathtaking.
Just then my parents came up behind me, also staring at the train. I was going to Hogwarts.
