QUICK THING: This 'Ask Book' contains a LOT of roleplayling, because that's more fun to me than just answering questions. Obviously if things get too out of hand I will stop the current roleplay and answer normal questions before roleplaying again. Cool?
Okay, let's go.
Sexy/+18 stuff is allowed, but no rape, that's bad.5 Questions per partRole playing is definitely allowed!You can bring your OCs into this as well, if you like.
That's all I can think of...The Characters!
RobynShe's a vampire. She's kinda loud. She's super sarcastic and cocky, and you often get the best reactions out of her. But she's fragile. Mentioning the wrong thing (AKA Her past) will set her off.
UnrealMy evil side. She's not afraid to put a knife to your neck or shoot you. And unlike me, she can handle feelings very well. BUT she can become extremely embarrassed. She's the fianc√© of Danger-Line 's Darkiplier (oh my god that was one hell of a feels ride wasn't it? #Dareal4Lyfe) and will literally stab you if you try to hurt/take/be a jerk to him.
SepticSeptic is my DarkSepticEye. He's a total dick, not to mention a womaniser. He's vain and full of himself, but also has some kind of humour. A sick, fucked-up, twisted kind of humour at that... But, I've gotta admit, he's got a soft spot for Danger-Line 's Crimson.
(Wow, mentioned you twice in one update, how do you feel?)
Now my people, ask away!
