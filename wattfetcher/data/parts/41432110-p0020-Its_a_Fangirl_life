Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were going camping. They pitched that tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: "Watson look up at the sky and tell me what you see." Watson replied. "I see millions and millions of stars." Holmes said, "And what do you deduct from that?" Watson replied, "well if there are millions of stars, and even if a few of those have planets, it's quite likely that there are some planets like Earth out there. Is there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life." And Holmes said, "Watson you idiot it means that somebody stole our tent."
