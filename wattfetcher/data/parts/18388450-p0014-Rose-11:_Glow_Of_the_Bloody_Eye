As much as we do kill vampires, we don't kill them without an extreme reason and being a thirsty vampire is one." He was dead serious right now and I could see it in his eyes.
"These kind of vampires are really dangerous and have no control over themselves, that's why we have to kill them. You never know what's going around inside them, whether they are sad, delighted or desperate to what they are doing."
"What do they do?"
"Eliminate the humankind. That's why we are helping them. You see, if they completely vanish the human race, we won't be able to survive because we only survive by their blood and only their blodd,no substitution. So by the cooperation with them will give us what we want. Their blood."
"That's manipulative." I mumbled.Â It disturbed me how they thought things through, sounded somehow ignorant. But I was convinced.
"Are you ready to start, Rose?" He looked at me with some hope in his eyes. "I...... don't take no as an answer."
He smirked.
Oh shit.
