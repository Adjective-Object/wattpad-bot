I saw their lips moving but no sound was coming out, I was too confused and distracted to listen to them, I mean ... COME ONE ! I've just recieved and expensive car, we became extremely rich and Tom is probably muslim !
"I'm going to call my parents, excuse me" I left the girls and headed to an empty room.
I called mom's phone 20 times then dad's 25 times but nobody answered.
"What's wrong ?" Hannah asked
"A little worried. Oh ! Listen, here's your bag, and thanks for-" , "This is not my bag, this is Molly's" Hannah cut me off, I watched Molly's face getting nervous, "I'm sure it's yours, this notebook has your name on it" I passed the notebook, Hannah chuckled, "I write me name every where, that's Molly's notebook". Molly was looking at me and told me to not to say a word, "You owe me an explanation" I whispered.
I woke up at 5 to pray fajr, I couldn't get back to sleep so I read few pages from the Holy Qur'aan. My phone buzzed when I was about to sleep, "Dont open the window, S.A" What now ? I heard a knock on my window 3 times, "I said don't open the window, S.A" But like they say, curiousity killed the cat, I wrapped my head and body with a blanket, brough a knife then opened the window slowly.
"What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? You might fall" I screamed at him, "Then let me in" He smiled, "You really are crazy, of cource im not letting you in, what do you want ? You are not supposed to be here" I wanted to let him in tho "I was walking around because I couldn't sleep then I saw light coming out of your window, and I was like :Why is the primcess up so early ? so I thought of getting some cake and coffee and have breakfast with you since you are up too" I'd be lying if I said that my heart didn't ache, Is this real ? Do these people actually exist ? What is he ? Why is he too damn sweet ? "Hurry up, the coffee is getting cold", He passed me a piece of strawberry cake and coffee, "But I'm not letting you in" I raised an eyebrow, "Who said anything about getting in ? I'll just hang here on the window with one hand and eat with the other one then fall and break 5 bones" He said sarcastically, "Thank you Simon, for everything, for the party, the dress and this... why are you doing all of this !?", "You know you look like a worm with this blanket on your head, right ?" Simon chuckled, "Shut up and leave before I push you, did you have to ruin the moment ?" I took a bite from the cake, "You're welcome" Then he jumped away like a ninja, I checked him out as he landed on the ground like Edward Collins but then he pulled his pants, "HEY ! Are you checking out my butt ???" He frowned and I bursted out in laughter "Shut up and leave before I call the guards, where are they by the way?" Handsome and sweet and also funny with a sarcastic side ... What would I want more than this ? I've always wanted something romantic like this, a man climbing to my window with flowers and some romantic music in the background ... Cake and coffee are fine too, "They let me in, I had to drag Damon into his outer room beside the pool because he was drunk, I told him not to drink much when I was dancing he took the chance" Then the moment got ruined.
"Go away" I threw the cake and coffee at him, "ITS HOT" I shut the window without checking if he got burnt "What happened?" He asked but I pulled the blanket over me, No one is perfect, I thought he was better and wiser and was about to like him. Who needs a handsome youngman with a hot figure but also drinks and goes to clubs ... He's not muslim anyway so there isnt any chance for us to become something ...
In school, I tried to talk to Tom but he ignored me and kept running away, so did Molly, what's wrong with those too ? "So, now that you got a fancy car you don't need mine ha ?" Damon said, "I never did" I turned my face away, "What's wrong? Why are you so cold ? You usually make fun of me or something", "Don't want to talk to someone that drinks and does clubbing", "What ? What clabbing? We aint allowed to go to clubs here before we get 20 years old", "Dont you lie", "I'm not, I swear", "FINE".
