Chapter 2- Confused
-Sky's POV-
I woke up the next morning, well actually I didn't even go to sleep but anyway, I'm going to start school tomorrow for the first time and I need to go shopping to buy the clothes I need, so I can fit in.
After I got dressed I went downstairs and followed a delicious smell, leading to the kitchen.
"Ah, dear your up, please sit down and have some breakfast, I made pancakes," Mary said gesturing the seat opposite her, so I sat down.
"Thank you for letting me stay here," I said to her.
"Oh, it's my pleasure," she smiled, "ever since my husband died, it's been quite lonely."
I looked around and saw a picture of Mary and another guy who had his arms around her; they look really happy.
"Is that him?" I asked pointing at the picture and she nodded.
"Yes it is, his name was Martin."
I feel kind of sad seeing her so happy even though she lost the love of her life, it must be hard for her.
"So are you going anywhere today?" she asked.
"Yeah, I'm going shopping, to get all the stuff for school tomorrow," I replied.
"Oh I guess you better go, the mall gets very busy in the afternoon."
***********
I followed a map till I was at the central mall and to be honest I've never been shopping in my life so this is kind of strange for me.
As I entered the mall people were rushing pass.
"Oh sorry," I apologized as I bumped into someone.
What shop should I go in first?
I decided to go in a shop and see what I could buy.
After I while of shopping my hands where fall of bags, and I'm tired as shit.
************
When I got home, I laid all my clothes out on the bed and counted up how much a spent.
"Sky, dinners ready," I heard Mary shouting from downstairs.
"Coming!"
After I hung up all m clothes I sprinted downstairs to have dinner.
Hopefully tomorrow goes as I planned.
***********
I woke up the next morning, pretty early actually.
After I had a shower, I sat in front of my closet.
What should I wear?
I need to wear something that's hot and it will get me into the popular group.
About 20 minutes later I finally made up my mind, and decided to wear, a white sleeveless crop top, black skater skirt, black wedges, and my black leather jacket. My make up was simple because that's all I could do, and my hair was in light curls, which took me like an hour to do and I burnt my self a lot of times.
I looked in the mirror and my eyes catched my little birth mark on my shoulder. It's not that big but it kinda looks like a rose.  I've had it since I was a baby, I don't know what it is or what it means.
After I put my jacket on and  grabbing my bag I jogged downstairs to say goodbye to Mary.
"Oh wait, Sky!" Mary called so I turned round, "here," she said handing me a key.
