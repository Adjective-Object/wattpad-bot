'Been coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down, because I want it so bad
Started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss'
The song progresses and I begin to dance around now, strumming the chords.
'But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open my eager eyes
Because I'm Mr Brightside'
I begin dancing around in the guitar solo, but my laces begin to unravel and trip over my own feet, ejecting myself straight off the stage. The crowd begins to laugh and I land on top of someone, letting out a groan.
The man gets up and helps me up. He has a blonde hair falling out of a New York Yankees snapback, red sunglasses, a black t-shirt and skinny jeans. Bloody hell, how did I manage to land on top of the lead singer of Fall Out Boy?
'Did you enjoy your trip?' He grins, helping me up. I can feel my cheeks go bright red. Unfortuantly my bandmates are in fits of laughter rather than helping me back up on the stage.
'God this is awkward' I murmur. The crowd is shrieking, obviously wandering what the hell is going on.
'Want help getting back up there?'  Patrick laughs.
'Uh, yes please' I laugh awkwardly. The neck of my guitar has fallen right off in the process as well. Eugh.
Being only 5'2, he easily picks me up and places me back on the stage.
'Thanks' I laugh. A stage manager comes out and hands me another guitar, while Patrick places the remaining pieces of my old one on the stage.
'Okay, guys. I sort of uh...Fell. Let's start with another song. How about Decode?'
Ray starts the intro, me following whilst in the process making a mental note to avoid Patrick at all costs for the rest of this tour, especially if I want to forget what just happened.
