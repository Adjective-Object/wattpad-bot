Harry's POV (omg whuuut?!)
"I am done playing your games dad! That was before and I told you not to do that to her! She was a crush of mine not a girl you could take into your business!" I growled.
My pathetic stepfather chuckled, an evil chuckle like one of pure insanity. He doesn't even deserve the title of 'stepfather'. I used to actually like him, until he became obsessed with her. He knows she's mine.
"Oh Harry, but you just don't understand, do you? She was one of my best. I got more money off of her than any of my others," he sneered.
I wish she wouldn't have had to go through that. All I wanted was to call her mine, I didn't even care back then what happened to her. I just needed her, but now, I care for her safety. I care for Lennon..
"Do you really think I care how much money you made off of her? She's a woman not a toy. Stop treating her like one," I almost shouted.
Soon as the boys fetched Lennon from the streets for me, I treated her like shit. I was horrible to her because I didn't know how to act once I got her into my life. Now, after about two weeks of her living at the apartment, I actually know how to treat her.
My stepfather, Brock, has been helping me get her for three years. He thought it was a good idea to make her a "hooker" and he was her boss. And I was so selfish that I agreed with him, anything to have her. She got tired of it after a few months, so she quit. It made him furious. Ever since he's been trying to get her to work for him again. Now, I realize how greedy he actually is and I need to protect Lennon from him.
"I will hurt her if need be.. although, if you just give her to me, there will be no problem," he smirked. That was enough. Enough for me to go insane.
I slammed him against the brick wall in the alleyway and shouted, "Don't you dare lay one finger on her, ever! Or I will kill you!"
Like the cold-hearted person he is, he laughed, "I knew you loved her, but not that much. You are such a fool."
"A fool?" I spat, "I know more about love than you do, Brock. You're nothing but a heartless bitch."
"You're right, I am. I really don't give a damn how you feel or her. All I need is the money," the man smiled like a creep.
Before I knew what I was doing, I pushed Brock to the ground and punched him several times. I hissed, "You better forget about Lennon because she's mine! If I ever see you near her again, I won't hesitate to come after you. She's an innocent girl and you need to stay away from her."
He didn't reply like I expected. So I walked back to the apartment to find the only thing that matters to me. Lennon..

Lennon's POV
Harry hasn't come back yet and I'm beginning to worry. I know he's with his stepfather, but I never met him. I wonder what he's like?
It's currently 5'o clock and the guys left to go see a movie a few minutes ago. They invited me, but I put down their offer. I needed time to myself to think about my current problems.
Brock's threats, Fawn's betrayal, Zayn's outburst, and Harry's constant mood swings cloud my thoughts. Why can't I just be happy for once?
Brock. First of all, he's an asshole. He doesn't care about me, he cares about his money. The only reason he possibly wants me to work for him again is because of the green paper I earn. I absolutely hated working on the streets, more than I hated living on them. He made me sell my body to complete strangers. I had to loose my virginity to a unknown person, something I wanted to remember and cherish. It didn't happen.
