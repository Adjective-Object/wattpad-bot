Anorexia-is NOT just skipping a few meals
Anxiety-is NOT worrying about just a few things
Insomnia-is NOT just trouble falling asleep
Bulimia-is NOT just throwing up a few moves
Depression-is NOT just being sad for a few days
Self-harm-is NOT just a few injuries here and there
These are DISEASES. You don't CHOOSE.
These people are VICTIMS.
They are NOT attention-seekers.
