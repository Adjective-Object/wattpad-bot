Me: YUP

Foxy: ALONE?

Me: YUP. I already went over this with Freddy and Goldie, MY MOM IS NOT ALIVE.

Chica: Oh, Proxis, I'm SO sorry!

Me: No biggie, she's been dead for two years...

Bonnie: I SO WANT TO GIVE YOU A FREAKIN HUG!!

Foxy: Back off!

Me: Ummmmmmmmmm...

Bonnie: We'll be there in a minute!

I put down my phone and sighed, great.... I went down the hall to my room and pulled those little things you put on the door handle out. I labeled them, one for each of my friends... Wow...Feels weird to think that I have friends...
I went down the hall, picking out rooms as I went. Once I had them all labeled, I went downstairs to wait.
Bonnie arrived first, at least, I assumed it was his because his truck was purple. Yup. Bonnie stepped out of his truck and walked up the driveway.
When he reached the door I opened it and let him in, he looked around like it was the first time he'd ever seen a house.
"This...Is where you live?!" he asked, shocked. I nodded and grabbed his arm, he let me pull him up the stairs to the hallway his room was in. "How do you know your way around?" he asked, I shrugged and mouthed,
"Good memory."
He nodded and I opened his room's door. It was a large, lavender room with a view of my back garden. Bonnie looked around for a moment, then set his stuff on the bed. He walked to the window and looked out at the garden.
"It's really pretty," he commented, breaking the silence. I smiled, he's really nice...
My thoughts were broken by the doorbell. I rushed out of the room to open the door, and Bonnie tried to beat me to it. I won, and he collapsed a shivering heap on the floor as I opened the door to Foxy.
"What happened to him?" he asked, glancing at Bonnie. I shrugged, and Bonnie protested,
"That girl is a demon! My legs are, like, twice the size of hers and she beat me in a race!" I smiled and showed Foxy to his room, he set his stuff down and we headed back downstairs the Bonnie, who was flipping through channels on my living room TV.
The bell rung again and I opened it to Freddy, Goldie and Chica, who were all holding brown, yellow and gold backpacks.
"Thank you for inviting us, Proxis!" Freddy, Goldie and Chica said simultaneously. They walked in and poked around, I gestured for them to follow me and they did.
I led each of them to their rooms, and they dropped off their bags. The others went downstairs, but I stayed and went to my room. I poked around a bit and found what I'd been looking for. I grinned.
I ran downstairs, find in hand and greeted my friends.
"Whaaaaattt's that?" Bonnie asked nervously. I rolled my eyes and uncapped the dry-erase marker, then began to write on the board it went with.
