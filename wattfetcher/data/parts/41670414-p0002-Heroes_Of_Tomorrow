" See the thing is, I think most of us are tired of being here. "

I didn't listen and pushed out of the way, they pulled out their rifles with their sleeping darts. Most started running to the exit, but some actually stayed. I was getting shot but healing at the same time, but it was slowing me down. Taylor was dashing out with electricity flowing through him. I was running out and saw Gwen get shot.
" Ahhh shit, lets go. " I said as I picked her up.
I kept getting shot through so it was getting hard, Megan grew wings and swooped in and picked me and Tiffany up. Later we all met up in a nearby ally, we looked out and saw the big televisions showing out escape and a search for us. We were in Seattle, all these years we were living under Seattle.
