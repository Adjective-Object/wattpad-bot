I hate this place. I mean, it could be worse, I guess. I could still be living with those crazy lumps of flesh that call themselves my parents, so, yeah, things could suck more than they do right now.
I always lived in America, my whole life. Up until my parents decided to ship me off to London where I couldn't bother them anymore.
Life is horrid here at the London Institute for Gifted and Talented, whatever that means. I hate being the odd one out because I actually got in on talent.
My parents could have sent me somewhere else, but I wanted to go here, so I auditioned, and I got in.Singing, dancing, writing, drawing, and acting. These few talents are how I got here. Sadly, they'll let anyone with money in these days, so all the other students are rich, talentless kids, whereas I'm the "poor girl", the loser, the freak, if you will.______________After my daily shower, I make my way back to my shared room. My roommate, Celia, got sick today, though, so she's in the infirmary, and it's just me tonight. Or so I'd thought.
I catch a glimpse of the moving figure in the corner of my eye, heading back to my shockingly open window. I run and slam its doors, trapping the thing inside.
It races across the floor to my closet, where it disappears. I open it, only to find a boy, who couldn't possibly be more than two years older than I am.
He gets up and looks at me funny, then walks back to the window, where he exits calmly. I sit on my bed, thinking it was all a dream, and lay down to go to sleep.
