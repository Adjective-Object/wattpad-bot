Ruby POV
She's not dead but she's on life support...it hurts me to see her like this.....and its all because of me. I've even gone back to smoking cigarettes. It's been a month and she's still not up. They never found Phobe and me and my mom? We no longer talk. My dad said he's gonna divorce her but I doubt that'll happen. I sat next to her grabbing her hand. She looks dead already. Frail....I kissed her hand " hey babe? You know the doctor told me something about you...But it's impossible. What he told me couldn't ever happen right? " I sighed and kissed her lips "I love you and I'll be back in a hour "
( what do y'all think the doctor told Ruby about tash?)
