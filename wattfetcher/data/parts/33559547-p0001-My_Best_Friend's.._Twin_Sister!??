Third Person POV
The guys all sat around the living room watching a horror movie. But what they didn't expect was for a girl who had similar features to the boy yelling at the screen, to appear out of the blue.
Josh and his best mates, Nick, Joe and Kevin were scattered all around the living room. Nick and Joe took up the long couch, while Josh took up a recliner and Kevin sat on the floor.
They all had bowls of popcorn and soda cans laying around. They didn't mind the mess much. As long as they cleaned before Josh's mom arrived, they were all good.
It was a dark cloudy day. It had been raining earlier so they all decided to just stay indoors. Josh's parents were working as always and wouldn't get home before dinner.
Josh's older brothers were out with friends, and like his parents, wouldn't get home till dinner. As the boys were all into the movie, they all yelled and jumped in their seats when the doorbell rang.
They all sent each other a glance before laughing and shaking their heads. Josh got up and made his way towards the door to check on who had rang. But when he opened the door he was faced with the empty silent night.
Frowning he looked around before shaking his head and going back inside. Before walking back into the living room he made sure to lock the doors securely.
When he entered the room he was met with scared and confused looking mates. "What's wrong guys?" he questioned confused taking a seat back into the recliner.
"Josh, umm, w-who e-else is home?" Joe asked scared. His eyes were wide as he held onto a cushion. Nick and Kevin rolled their eyes and tried to mask their true emotions as well.
"No one, why?" Josh asked confused. "Joe said he saw someone with the same exact hair color as you, probably lighter, walk into the kitchen. We said it was probably your mom, but we then realized she's working." Nick stated.
Josh confused leaned forward in his chair. "Wait. Exact same hair color as me?" he questioned. Joe nodded fiercely. Josh frowned before his eyes widened. "No." he whispered.
But before anyone could ask him what was up, the same exact person Joe saw earlier, walked into the living room with a beer in hand. "What's up guys? What's going on?" they questioned confused.
All the guys yelled and threw themselves backwards. Josh looked at the person wide eyed. "YOMI!?"
A Month Ago:
Josh was sitting in his room with Kevin and Joe when he heard the doorbell ring. Getting up he made his way quickly down the stairs and towards the door. Opening the door he was met with grey blue eyes and a head with light brown locks.
"Nick! Finally, we've been waiting." Nick gave Josh a sheepish smile while he entered. "Sorry, got caught up with things." he stated smirking. Josh laughed and shook his head.
"Let's go. The guys are waiting up stairs." Locking the door, both of them made their way up the stairs. Nick suddenly stopped and stared at a door at the end of the hallway.
"Hey, Josh. . . Who's room is that? I've been knowing you since the seventh grade and I've noticed no one goes in there." Nick stated confused. Josh tensed up but smirked. "You'll find out soon. Just stay away from there." Josh replied walking into his room.
Nick shrugged and followed his best mate.
