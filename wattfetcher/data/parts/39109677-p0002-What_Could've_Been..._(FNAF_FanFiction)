Mrs. Herna walked to the front of the room, and began the morning announcements. In a small town like ours people didn't bother installing a loudspeaker to do them. Not enough people lived here.
"So, class," Mrs. Herna started, "Today I have an announcement specific to our class." we all sat forward in our seats, save for me. "Today we have a new student joining us, he moved here a week ago and just started settling in. His town was undergoing serious renovation, and moving orders were issued. Due to this fact, he moved here with four other families, but those kids aren't in this class, just him. But I'm sure you all will meet the others as well, their schedules are pretty diverse." she paused for a minute, reading the folder the teachers were given to read from. "He'll be here any minute, he's been given a grace period to settle in and learn where things are, he's probably going to be late for the next few days." The entire class collapsed their held breaths, they'd be getting impatient soon, this was the first possible hit of something new since my mother's death.Well, that sucks. I mentally reprimanded, you'll have to wait a couple more minutes.
