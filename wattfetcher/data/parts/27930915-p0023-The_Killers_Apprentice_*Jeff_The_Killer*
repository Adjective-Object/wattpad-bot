"Oh, I'm sorry." Wyatt wraps his arms around me. I slowly return the hug and pat his back. I don't quite get why I'm enjoying this, but I am. I've never been a very huggy person but right now this is kind of needed. "I'll just watch TV and leave you alone."
"Good deal." I smile and lay back on the couch.
5 minutes pass and I hear a distant scream from the back of the hallway.
"Mom?" I hear Wyatt yell down the hall way, worried.
Jeff isn't seriously doing this right now, is he?
"Stay here, okay?" I ask him and run down the hallway into Jeff's room. I enter the back room where the screaming is coming from to find Jeff with a big ass smile on his face as he cuts into Wyatt's mother. The situation doesn't really bother me, it's more the overwhelming iron smell from all her blood. "Jeff, will you please do this later?"
"But I already started!" He whines.
"Okay, can you shut her up then? Wyatt can hear her." I tell him.
He rolls his eyes. "Fine. But doing it when she can't feel it is no fun." Jeff takes the handle of his knife and knocks her out with it. "And do you mind making me some food or something?" He asks.
I shake my head. "I don't mind. What would you like?" I ask him.
"Doesn't matter." He shrugs, wiping the blood off his hands. "And sorry about waking you up early, I just.. don't do well with kids."
"It's fine, I understand." I smile and kiss his cheek.
Jeff's white cheeks fill with red. He's taken aback by my actions. "What was that for?"
"I.. I don't know." I shrug.
"Oh. Okay." He nods slowly and goes back to work.
