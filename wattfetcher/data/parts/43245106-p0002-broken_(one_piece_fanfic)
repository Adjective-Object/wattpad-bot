i groaned and took out a sword nami sanji and robin were busy and usobb and chopper are idiots so i guess i have to take care of the damn thing i saw red on the wolf back and squinted and i saw luffy waving his arms at me and i got his message
its ok it isn't dangerous i told my panicking ship mates putting my sword away the wolf leaped an landed square on the boat blood dripping from its abdomen
it started to glow and was then a human with a stab wound
luffy turned tome this is um well i guess she doesn't have a name but she has the shifting devil fruit power she can be any thing its so cool
um hate to screw you over but what is she doing the girl was climbing over the rails of the boat then jumped off

luffy:
idiot i yelled and streched my arms out i caught her and pulled her back onto the boat
what are you doing you can't swim
i was for filling masters final request
you know you dont have to any more hes dead
i was born to serve him
i felt my eyes widen he wasn't kidding when he said he broke your spirit she didn't answer
she just carried on talking about her 'master'
with out him there is no place for me
join my pirate crew and if you don't want to at least stay alive
okÂ she stated simply
well that was easier than i thought go talk to chopper hell fix the stab wound
ok she said then left
zoro:
ok what is with that girl she looks dead
i know she doesn't even have a name kreig got her when she was six but what i dont get is why she cant remember her own name
yeah shes kind of freaky and whats with the hood she hasn't taken it down its hard to see her face oh well she really needs a name though
luffy looked thoughtful how about mei since we got her to join in may different spelling same pronunciation
that i the smartest thing you have ever said in you life
WHAT THE FUCK me luffy and probably the rest of the island heard chopper yell and we went running to his room / infermary
