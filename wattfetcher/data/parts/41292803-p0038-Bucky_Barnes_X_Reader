I woke up with a fever. I sat up in bed, momentarily forgetting my bandaged ribs. I inhaled sharply. I squeezed my eyes shut to try and block out the dream. The dead man. His face would always haunt me. I got out of bed only to sink to the floor moments later. Sobs wracked my body and choked me.

But I wasn't alone. His arms were around me in an instant. He comforted me without words. He wasn't there to tell me all the things I wanted to hear. He was there to hold my heart together. Slowly, my sobs quieted.
I turned and looked at him. Gently ever so gently, he brushed my hair away from my face. He lips gently touched mine. Suddenly he was kissing me. And I was kissing back. His hands were in my hair and mine were in his. His kiss seemed to help the hurt that had so deeply affected me. Maybe the cure for pain, is love. I had never felt anything like it, but as we pulled away, I saw my own love in his eyes. He gently ran my fingers through my hair.

I love you. He whispered, just as the door burst open.
