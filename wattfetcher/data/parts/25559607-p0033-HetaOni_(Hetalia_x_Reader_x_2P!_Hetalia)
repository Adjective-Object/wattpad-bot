---CHAPTER IV: Gunshots (Part 3)---
~Reader-chan's PoV~
I turned around to see who called me.
No one.
This feels oddly familiar...
I tried to think of what happening was similar to this, but I simply can't remember.
I then shake my head. "It must be just my imagination.. I mean all the battles and stuff.. Maybe... Yeah.. That's it."
I took a deep breath before opening the door to where Italy and Germany were.
I only saw Italy, but I knew Germany was probably inside the iron closet place er, whatever.
"Italy, Japan told me to tell you that there's going to be an emergency meeting." I said.
Italy perked up. "What? So everyone is here! Let's go back to the fireplace room, then!"
"Yeah... They said that some are missing, though. But we'll talk about it later." I told him.
I then turn to the closet door. "Uhm..? Germany? We need to go now, if you don't mind.."
"Understood." He replies from the other side.
Germany went out of the closet.
The burly man scratches the back of his hand. "Sorry for making you wait."
"Ve~ Are you okay now? Do you want to go in there again?" Italy asks his friend.
Germany shook his head. "No, it's okay. And I probably won't come back here. Or rather, I hope I won't."
I smiled and spoke, "Really? That's good to hear. Now, let's hurry up. Japan told me that we can't take our time here and we need to talk to them as soon as possible."
"You haven't found my brother, have you...?" Germany asks me.
I shook my head. "N-No... but I... Actually, I have an explanation for that.."
Germany raises an eyebrow. "What?"
"I'll save that story for when we're all together." I tell him.
"I-It'll be okay!! Cheer up, Germany!" Italy says comfortingly.
I nodded. "Come on, they're waiting for us."

==Fireplace room==
I opened the door to the fireplace room slowly and spoke, "We're back..."
"Ja. Sorry we took a while." Germany apologises.
Russia suddenly points to me. "Not to be rude, but...who's the girl and what's she doing here?"
Canada nods. "I've been wondering that, too."
They all turned to me and...well, of course..
I gave them an awkward wave.
"Oh..that's right. She's in the same situation as us." Japan said as he sat down.
I decided that I should introduce myself this time. "H-Hello.. My name is _____ _____, You can just call me (first name)."
Canada smiles. "Hello, _____. I'm Canada."
I fangirled inside.
"Nice to meet you." I told him. (>///<)/
