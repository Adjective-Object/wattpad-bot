I'm wrong, I'm doing haram things by staying here with them, the Satan has washed my mind and told me that it was Okay. I failed the Test my parents has put me through. They trusted me, they told me not to be way too close to the other gender. But, here I am, failing my parents and breaking some rules in my religion.
"Leena" I woke up when someone called my name.
"Astaghfero Allah. That's wrong, I'm wrong, I'm doing mistakes" My eyes widened.
"What's wrong ?" Diana asked.
"Everything I'm doing. Thank you Peter for waking me up, you're right, it is the same thing, I made many sins today and failed my parents, I hope Allah forgives me" My eyes got teary.
"I-I want t-to go home" I said.
"I-I'm sorry if I upset you I really didn't mean to, I won't force you to go on a date with me" Peter said.
"No, it's me, you didn't do anything" I struggled to stop my eyes from raining. I pulled my bag and opened the door.
"Wait, it's late, I'll take you home" Jake said.
"Did you not hear me ?" I got out.
"Take the car" Elina threw the keys of Damon's car at me. I took them and jumped in it.
I started the car and drove. I broke down in tears while I tightened my grip on the steering wheel.
"What have I done" I whispered in regret, I should've left when I saw them enter the house.
I sped up and reached the house in 10 minutes, the door was locked, I used the hidden key under the mailbox, it's 10:30 pm and Mrs.Carter hasn't returned yet.
Wait a second, 10:30 !!!! I didn't pray Maghrib or even Asr prayer, Astaghferollah, the Satan has really got me.
"Astaghferollah wa atoobo elayh" I washed my face and changed my clothes after I made sure I locked the door twice. I did wadu' and prayed the prayers I missed.
My parents were right, I'm not old enough to face this life alone.
I slid in bed and turned myself off after I did a 100 istighfar.
....................................
Few days passed, nobody spoke about that night, Elina apologized to me, and I haven't spoken to Damon or any other boys since then.
"Leena wake up it's 3 pm, you have to go to work" Elina shook me.
"What day is it" I opened my left eye.
"Sunday, looks like you slept late last night because of your assignments" she giggled.
"WHAT ? 3 PM !!!" I've just realized what she said two minutes ago, Elina laughed loudly.
I got myself ready fast and ran downstairs.
"Need a ride ?" Damon asked but I ignored him and got in my shoese.
"Why have you been ignoring me since the day we went to Simon's house" He asked.
"I'm just making up for my mistakes" I ran to my work, I don't want to upset my pinky grumpy boss. She keeps wearing pink ... ALWAYS.
.....
"Perfectly in time" My boss said and I nodded.
I headed to my place behind the counter and started counting.
"105 dollars please" I said to the client.
