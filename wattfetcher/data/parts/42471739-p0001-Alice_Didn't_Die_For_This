(The Hatter's P.O.V)
It's quite fun. Killing another living thing, you see.Â  Whether it be a silent death as such of that of an unlucky rose that had once flourished in the gracious sunlight, or a rather deafening and horrific one such as that of a grown man being shredded to bits by a single, keen-edged blade. Hell, I would know such pleasure first-hand, for I have been the one to slay those who are ungrateful of remaining entirely sane.
The occupation of a hatter isn't necessarily difficult, as one might imagine. I, myself would consider it as nothing more than a joyous game. Utter child's play, a leisurely stroll on a glorious May morning, or perhaps a dream that one such as myself may never want to wake up from. Those are only a few of several terms I'd use to describe the feeling that erupts from within the very depths of my soul as I take part in my hatting of sorts.
The story has been told, passed down, carried on, twisted, mangled, and mutilated far too many times, for the tales of Wonderland have long since been shriveled down to pure nothingness. Mine, Alice's, and far too many other's wellbeing has been completely, utterly, entirely, and wholly dismembered just like that of a gruesomely slaughtered body that's only destiny is to rot and rot until nothing but dust remains. Our lives have been seized from us, as well as our sanity.
She has been seized from me. That little girl that just so happened to dream a bit too vividly while in slumber in a meadow.
My Alice.
