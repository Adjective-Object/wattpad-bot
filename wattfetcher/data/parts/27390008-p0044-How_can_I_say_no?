Today was the world premiere of stand by me. I stood next to johnny, both of us in jeans and t-shirts. Cameras flashed in front of us and I fought the urge to squint each time I saw the flash. Johnny's arm was around my waist protectively and I had my arm behind his back. Although no one could see, I'm pretty sure Johnny knew I had his shirt in a death grip. Everything about tonight was strange and nerve wracking. We moved further down the red carpet and more pictures were taken. I don't think Johnny was ready to show the world just how much he loved me. Every time someone yelled for him to kiss me, it was be a quick kiss. I understood why he was doing it; it could be twisted by the media. And Johnny wanted to keep me safe. We finally reached the end of the red carpet and went inside the theater. I looked around and spotted two of my favorite actors talking to one of my favorite youtubers. My eyes went wide. Johnny noticed.

"You wanna go meet them?" He asked. I looked up at him.

"Seriously?" I asked. Johnny nodded.

"Yeah. Come on." He said and dragged me over to them. "Hey guys." I hid behind Johnny as he talked with them. He looked back at me and saw me looking at them in awe. "Uh there's someone who wants to meet you but she's kinda nervous." Johnny moved so I couldn't hide behind him anymore. Standing before me was Tom hiddleston, Lee pace, and Dan Howell. I forgot how to breath for a second.

"Hi." I whispered. Dan smiled at me.

"Hello. I'm Dan." He said, holding out his hand. I shook his hand and nodded.

"I know. Danisnotonfire. I love your videos. I'm Samantha." I said. Dan smiled.

"Thank you." He said. I knew from watching his videos that he understood what I was going through at that moment. My eyes flicked to hiddleston.

"Hello love. You sure are lucky to get to date Johnny." He said. I nodded.

"I guess. But I wouldn't be here if it was for him." I replied. Tom nodded. Then I broke. "Oh my God I'm talking to loki." I blurted. I blushed and looked up at Tom. "I'm sorry. I just love you as loki."

"It's alright." Tom said and put his hand on my shoulder. I felt Johnny's grip tighten on my hand but I ignored it. Lee pace laughed and my attention was turned to him.

"Nice going Tom. She looks about ready to faint." He said.

"You're not helping much king thranduil." I countered. I watched as he stopped laughing and Dan started.

"A fangirl! Yes!" Dan exclaimed. I laughed nervously and noticed that Johnny let go of my hand and now he had his arm around my shoulders. I looked up to see him with a scowl on his face. We talked for a bit more before someone else joined us. At that point I almost did faint.

"Hi guys. Oh who's this?" He said. I held onto Johnny and stared at him wide eyed.

"Oh my God. It's Tyler Oakley." I said. He smiled and held out his hand.
