I was packing my stuff now.. We was leaving in 8 hours and I just started.. "Clothes, computer, money, phone, charger.. GOD" I said stressed running all over the house. I know what I'm going to bring, but where the hell is it? I got a text and saw "AshhhðŸ˜‹ðŸ™ˆ" I never change the names.. Something I should. "Looking forward to see you again xx" Inhaf to text him back, but yea.. "Wish I could say the same about you" I didn't get an answer now, yaay. I continued to pack and soon Niall was in the door laughing at me. "Stressed?" He laughed and gave me a hug. "You don't say.. Can you help me?" "of course" After two hours we was ready. Finally! I got the bag downstairs and found the clothes I was going to wear. Now we was going to sit on a plane for 10 hours... I decided to go for the pink today. Alot of pink! I got dressed and sat down on the couch with Niall. The dogs was playing again and now in the rain. I made two cups with Cocoa and gave one to Niall and there we sat together.. It couldn't be better than this right now. I hope that Ina is okay.. She haven't said anything to me for days! I'll give her time.. -7 hours later-Niall and I was packing in the car. We was going to drive together. Niall put in the bags and I got the dogs. I was so excited now. Finally a new tour with the boys. After ten minutes Niall was done and sat in the car. "Ready girl?" He asked and started the car. "I am" Then he drove away. -at airport-We met the boys outside and Harry looked a little nervous. "What's wrong?" I asked him. "I don't think you'll get so happy" he said and turned around. Yep.. There they was.. Luke, Calum, Michael and the jerk.. I can't sit on the same plane as them.. I don't want to!
