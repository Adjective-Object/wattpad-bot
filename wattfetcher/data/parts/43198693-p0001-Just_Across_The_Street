*possible trigger warning
It was the worst day of my life. I was leaving my friends, who were easily a better family than my parents and big sister. Damaged. That was probably the only word to describe me and my disfunctional family...
My parents were planning to divorce after several years of marriage yet abuse, both physical and verbal. Then I had my big sister who was suffering of an eating disorder. Then I had me - but we'll get to that later.
"Lilly, come on we're getting ready to leave" I heard mum call up to me. It was decided for me that I should live with her."Coming" I responded in an aggravated tone.That was it, my life was decided for me.
