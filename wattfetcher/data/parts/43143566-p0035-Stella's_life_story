i was about to go to sleep but it got interupted YET AGAIN.i saw it was mom and inwardly groaned.
'did dad force her to come up or something.'she lied down on the bed beside me and smiled a wierd smile making me frown.i dont want to trust people or get too close,even if it is my family.
she started kissing me on the cheek.,"Stop!"i snapped.,"why are you bitting my head off?"she asked.i shrugged
,"your just doing it on purpose."did she just forget what happened today?tch,how typical.slow as usual and doesnt get what i feel.how i want to go mute and just stop talking all together and starve myself to death but I'm forcing myself because i knew that wouldn't be fair to the little people that would miss me.
,"mm"i hummed in responce.,"wow.your mean."she said getting off me.'i know.i dont want to be..but i just am..im sorry..'she walked out of the room only to walk back in with cloths that she washed.
,"do you have homework."she said plainly like she was mad at me.,"no--wait yah english."she didnt show any emotion,"i thought you finished that."i rolled my eyes 'she thinks i didnt do it like she asked last night.'
,"its a packet."i said.she let out a single 'oh' then walked out the room. ,"love you"i tryed saying but she closed the door on me...'oh...'i thought.a few minuets later she came back and said it to me only to immeadiatly go back downstairs.
now im going to try and sleep but if the world keeps not letting me ill just stop trying..
NOPE THE WORLD WONT HAVE IT YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK YOU.mom came back up.but I'm not going to get into that,let me just say i dissapoint everyone..thats why you shouldnt stick around me for very long..as i sighed an annoyed and dissapointed sigh in myself i continued to listen to songs that sang how i felt.
