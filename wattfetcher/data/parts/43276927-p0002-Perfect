"there was a girl when i was fourteen.
she had brown hair, and brown eyes. i could've sworn she was my soulmate, you know? she was so amazing. i thought she had the perfect life, but i was wrong. she wasn't the perfect girl i thought she was but man, i still thought her laugh was the most beautiful sound in the world. i still thought that she was fucking beautiful.
she made me happy, man. that's all that mattered. i wanted to make her happy, but i couldn't and man, i stayed up crying because i couldn't make her fucking happy. i couldn't make her smile. i couldn't make her fucking happy.
that's all i thought about. not being able to make the girl i loved happy. it sucks. it made me want to fucking rip my fucking body open and let myself fucking die. of course, i still feel like that.
she got worse, and fuck, did i hate myself for not being able to help her. i felt useless, but i didn't wanna talk about my problems because she had it worse than me.
i remember, wondering how a girl with such a beautiful smile could be hurting so much.
i also remember sitting up at like, three in the morning wanting to die because if i can't make the girl i love happy, what's the use in living?"
"who was this girl?"
"i don't tell people her name. feel free to refer to her as mystery woman, but i won't tell you her name."
