When I was a little girl, I would always wonder what my life would be like when I would get older. I always wanted to stand out. Have a fun, full childhood. Accomplish great things. But honestly, looking back, I would describe my first 18 years as simple, or normal. Nothing very exciting or out of the ordinary ever happened. But the moment I laid eyes on him, I knew that was going to change.
A/N Hope u guys enjoy my story!!! I will be updating at least once a week:)
