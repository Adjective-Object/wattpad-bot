ROSS' POV
When we got here I just planned on avoiding Ariana but then again, that's really childish so after a while I decided to go look for her. I walked upstairs to our current room but when I got in there I didn't see Riley or Ariana, I noticed that all of the suitcases were unpacked but I still dont know where Ari and Riley are. I took my phone from out of my pocket and called her but she didn't answer. I started to search the whole house for them but I had no luck, I don't know where the others are but when I was in the kitchen aunt Joan walked in
Joan - Hey Ross
Ross - Hi aunt Joan, do you know where Ariana and Riley are?
Joan - Oh Ariana, yeah, she packed her bags and left with the baby
Ross - WHAT?!-why would she-where is she-what is she--
Joan - I dont know, but before she left she told me to tell you that she just doesn't love you anymore
Ross - But-your lying. Ariana would never do that
Joan - You're calling me a liar?
Ross - No-i- she wouldn't do that
Joan - Did she tell you that Riley-you know what?. I should stop talking
Ross - What?, no, what were you going to say?
Joan - Well, I overheard her talking on the phone to someone, I think his name is...Sean. Riley is not your baby, she's his and Ariana has been tricking you
ARIANA'S POV
It is now exactly  11: 35 pm and we just got back from the mall. Riley is sleeping and I have a lot of shopping bags, When we got to the mall it was about 9 o clock and while I was there, I had to deal with a lot paparazzi and fans. Man I hate them, not my fans of course, I hate the paparazzi cause all they do is try to ruin everyone's lives. We may be celebrities but we're normal people just like everyone else.I took Riley's sleeping figure out of her hello kitty car seat and the body guards took the shopping bags upstairs to Ross and i's room. I stopped in the kitchen to grab an apple and then I made my way upstairs to the room with Riley. She is always sleeping, that's all she does. Eat, cry and sleep
