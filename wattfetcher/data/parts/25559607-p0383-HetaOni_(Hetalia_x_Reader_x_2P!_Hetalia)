Back in the past, the piano room of the second timeloop, Past England and Past America stood side by side. They made no plan of leaving the room, even though they knew that it was going to detonate any second.



"Idiot." Past England spat out, facing the American beside him.


Past America creased his forehead. "What?"


"You're a failure. Do you really think you were a hero?" Past England asked, raising an eyebrow.


Tilting his head in confusion, Past America spoke, "England?"


"Listen, I'm a gentleman. Do you know what a gentleman is?"


"What?... Well..."


"A gentleman is always ahead of the hero, you know. That's why it came to my mind. About now you'll be surprised...and then..." Past England's breath suddenly became laboured as his knees gave away.


Past America quickly acted upon this and caught the Brit. With worried eyes, he spoke softly. "England..."


"... Listen, America."


"Yeah? What is it?"


"Not being alone in your final moments... isn't that bad, surpisingly." Past England smiled and slowly...closed his eyes.


Feeling a pang in his chest, he took a shaky breath and smiled back. "You're right. I'm not that bad, either..."

America, I paid you back. Please, take my power to the future. If you're a hero, you can do it, can't you?
