"Hurry I have to look at my hair before the bell rings!" I said dragging Alana behind me. I slammed myself into the bathroom doors rushing to the mirrors. I glanced at myself up and down, as my long brown hair falls to my side."C'mon we have 2 minutes."Alana complained starring me down."Okay okay!"I stumbled behind Alana to the office to get our schedules. We made our way through the crowd to an table."Alana Hastings, and Mia Ford." The woman shuffled through a stack of papers. She handed us our schedules with a grin on her face."And hell begins!"I whispered to Alana.--------------------------"Shut the doors because class has begun!" A man said. Me and Alana had 1st-5th periods together.I looked back at Alana and mouthed "he got booty" as I winked. She smiled as she examined him up and down. Alana nodded her head winking back.*Lunch* "What the fuck! Damn I hate school lunchs tomorrow we're going to get salads!" I commanded grabing a bag of chips. "Alana! Did u hear me?" She nodded her head looking at the auditorium. --------------------"Hola kids welcome to ur 7th period Spanish class. My name is Mrs.Castio."The rest was a blur as I pulled out my phone to text Alana. "You!"A loud voice says taping on my desk.I look up to a Mexican lady In front of me."What?" "What's ur name?"She questioned "It's Mia." I glared down at my phone as she said something. "Hello? Mia?""Yea?" I said raising my voice. "What's ur favorite part of school?" The lady asked with her hand on her hip."Leaving!" I grinned.Everyone let out a laugh. "Okay that's the bell. I look forward to seeing y'all tomorrow." I joined the big crowd that filled the hallway."Hey nice joke you made in Spanish."A muscular voice said in my ear. I turned around to see a tall boy with these big brown eyes and eyebrows that could kill. "Sure?" I said proud. I could see Alana walking up behind him. "Wow okay. I'm Jack.""And I'm leaving!" I mumbled rolling my eyes trying to make my way around him. "Mia right?" He asked walking by my side.I ignored him as I reached Alana."Bye!" He said as I we walked out the school doors."Who's was that?" Alana asked bumping my arm."Just this dude named Jack. And don't say it!""He's hot!" She said looking back."And there it is."I groaned getting into my car.The whole ride home we argued about witch song we should lesson to. "Friday after school I have a surprise for your birthday!" "Please not the male strip club again!""Trust me it's gonna be fun. Oh and wear something sexy." she yelled slamming my car door.Alana only lived 7 houses down from mine. *Friday*The warm sun hit my face. I sat up while my eyes adjusted to the light. I strolled over to my closet and pulled out the black skin tight dress and laid it across my bed for latter.I put on ripped skinny jeans and A shirt that say Queen B. I curled my Hair And did my makeup.I pulled my phone off the charger and texted Alana.To: My Sister from another misterüôÖüèø'I'm on my way'I grabbed my bag and drove to Alana's house. She ran to my car screaming happy birthday. "Happy birthday!" She screamed hugging my neck."Mhmm thanks!" I smirked as we both let out a laugh.We got to the school 30 minutes early. So We stood in the cafeteria talking to a couple other girls."Umm Cutie alert!!" Alana whispers as Jack makes his way over to us. "Hello Mia!"His deep voice whispered in my ear as he passed by. Alana just about fell to the ground when he said that."Calm down he's not even that cute!" I said rolling my eyes.The whole day was as boring as the rest. 1st period was math then language arts,3rd was science then Tx. History, 6th was choir and 7th was Spanish. Finally the bell rang to leave I gathered my things and headed out the door."Mia wait!" Jack yelled catching up.I kept walking down the wall way to meet Alana. As soon as I found Alan I turned around to see if he was still following me but he was just at another girls locker rubbing against her."Let's go!" ---------------- I got in the shower to get ready for latter. I did my hair and makeup and put on the black skin tight dress. I looked at the bottom of my closet and pulled out black pumps.I glanced over at my phone witch read My sister from another misterüôÖüèø'I'm on my way'"Mom Alana is here!" I yelled walking out the door. My mom is a single parent,when I was 6 my dad commuted suicide, I guess it's taken a real bad role on my mom. I jumped into Alana's car. "Soooo where are we going!" I asked tuning the radio up."This new bar/club that just opened trust me it's gonna be fun!" Alana squealed.We walked up to two big doors with music blasting through them. "Ready!"Alana asked putting more lipstick on."Hell yeah!" We walked into guys grinding on girls the smell of drunk people everywhere. I noticed someone off the corner of my eye as we made our way to the bar. "Mia?" A familiar voice said.I looked to my side to see jack and a group of his friends."Ugh what a great way to spend my birthday!" I complained raising my hand towards the bartender.----------------------------------------------Little cliffhanger for the first chapter. I hope talk like this FanFiction.
