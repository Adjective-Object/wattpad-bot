She looked up at him again, tears in her eyes. "No one wants me."
"What about Mom and Dad? They love you very much, Sakura. They'd be devastated if you're gone."
She groaned. "Mom and Dad," she whispered. "I love them so very much too." Then she looked up at him. "What about you? Do you love me?"
Sebastian swallowed. He hesitated. His hands fisted tight. His heart trembled.
"I see. You don't even like me? Just a little? As your sister?"
Sebastian slowly shook his head. No, he couldn't lie to her, not even in her state of sickness. "Sakura, I'm sorry."
Her heart retched with pain. "I see," she whispered, disappointed. She cast her eyes downward, hiding her tears.
Sebastian touched her chin and nudged her face so she could look at him. Very slowly he brought his face down to hers, and gently he kissed her on her lips.
Her lips were soft, and Sebastian loved the feel of her against him. His kiss was gentle and soft and very, very loving.
Tears burned in Sakura's eyes. So he loves me after all, she thought. She was so very happy. She relaxed against him and allowed him to kiss her deeper.
Sebastian had never kissed any girl before, and Sakura was his very first. Though he was inexperienced, his innate nature knew what it was doing. He opened his lips, plunged his tongue into her small mouth, and kissed her deeply-pouring out all of his love for her that he'd kept hidden within him for so long. His fingers dug deep into her thick hair, his thumb caressing her feverish skin.
When he moved his head back, breathless and his heart glowing with love, she smiled up at him. "Thank you," she said and then slowly closed her eyes again.
Sebastian knew she wouldn't remember their kiss when she woke again. He smiled sadly and thought at least for now he had her all to himself. He tightened his arms around her and kissed her forehead. "I love you," he whispered.
