Wine
Why: Wine is one of those drinks that can ignite passion, sensuality . . . but too much of it can bring other results. Scorpio is strong, passionate, and sensual but they also have another more serious side of themselves that can creep up seemingly out of nowhere. Wine also makes you a tad mellow, and Scorpio are known for their mellow, observant side.
