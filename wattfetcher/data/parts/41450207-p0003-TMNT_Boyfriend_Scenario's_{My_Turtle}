"Nope, i'm not scared of you, you're Adorkable!" You stated

Donnie chuckled at your statement

"I like you, Oh I should meet back up with my brothers before they have a cow" Donnie said

"Wait! what's you're-" You started but stopped

Cause you noticed he was gone.

Michelangelo

You were in an alley cause you really didn't have a home so you sat by the dumpster then you heard a loud crash next to you, something fell into the dumpster, you got up and looked in the dumpster and saw a turtle not just any turtle, a mutated one with a orange mask and adorable baby blue eyes and nun-chucks on his belt, you looked at him and he stared back.

"um, Hi?" you spoke

"Hi!" He spoke with a cherry tone and had an adorable smile

"i'm Y/n" You introduced

"Michelangelo but that's a mouth full so just call me Mikey" Mikey introduced

"Ok Mikey why are you in the dumpster?" You asked

"Oh! I was fighting the foot with my bro's but got kicked off the edge, speaking of bro's I should get back to them, I'll catch you later" Mikey said

"Wait, can I have you're num-" You started but stopped yourself

Only cause you realized he was long gone.
