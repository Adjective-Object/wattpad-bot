Evelyn's POV
UGG! Just another boring day at school. The good news is that Me, Simone, and Aubrey are having a sleepover this afternoon! We are also going to the beach. I can't wait!
After school
"I'm so happy we get to go to the beach!" Says Simone
"Me too!" I say
"Me three!" Says Aubrey
We walk down the hall and out the door.  Simone's mom is waiting for us.
"Did you guys have a good day at school?" She asks
"Yes!" We all say
We pile in her car and start driving
"So girls we are gonna stay at a hotel, near the beach." Says Simone's mom
"Ok cool" says Aubrey
We drive for a while and FINALY get to the hotel. We take the elevator to the top to get to our room. Me, Simone, And Aubrey get to sleep in the kids place. And her mom sleeps in the parents place. We get on our bathing suits. And head back down to the lobby.
"Do you kids want to get something from the gift shop?" Asks her mom
"YES!"
We walk to the gift shop and me and Simone see these rings called moon rings. (Media)
"Hey this is from mako mermaids!" Says Simone
"Yea it is" I answer
"Lets get them!"
"Alright"
We each get one moon ring
"MABYE it will turn us into mermaids" says Simone rolling her eyes
"Yea right" says Aubrey
We walk to the beach and run into the water, we walk into the deeper  end.
"Hey guys" says Aubrey
"My legs feel all tingly" says Simone
We all fall backwards
We all scream.
"TAILS?!" Screams Simone
I look at my legs, wait, it's a tail. A mermaid tail. And im wearing a bikini top.
"Let's try them out!" I say
"Wait, can we breath underwater?" Asks Simone
"I volunteer to try!" Says Aubrey
She dunks  her head in the water and comes back up
"YUP!!!"
"Guys lets swim over to the there where no one is, so we can figure this out" I say
We all dive underwater and swim over without comeing up for air
"Do you think we can do what the mermaids in the show do?" I ask
We all put our hands up to the tails and the tails start to dry up
"It's working!" Says Simone
We FINALY are back to normal
"What do we do?! If we get wet, we turn!" I say
"We just need to be careful" says Aubrey
"Really careful" says Simone
We run back to her mom, we don't tell her anything
