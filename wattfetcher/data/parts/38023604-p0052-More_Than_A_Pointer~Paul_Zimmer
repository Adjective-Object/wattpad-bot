Melanie's POV:
Paul had a lot of money. And I mean a lot.
Dear Jesus it was a lot.
If he spent one penny of it on me I would smack him.
I know that most girls liked when their boyfriend (or fiancé in my case) bought them shit, but it made me feel bad. I have the money to buy my own stuff, I don't need him to waste it on me.
I mean, if it's a birthday present then I won't stop him obviously. Because duh, birthday presents are awesome.
But if he throws me another one of those giant birthday parties like he did that one time a  few years ago I will smack him.
I will literally smack him.
"I don't want to sleep with my shirt off." I whined to him.
"Too bad. You made a deal."
"What if I get cold?"
"Ever heard of cuddling?"
"But then I'll get all sweaty and gross."
"Okay, you can use the comforter to keep you warm, and not get sweaty and gross."
"It'll hurt my boobs."
"How?"
"Chafing."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Materiel rubbing against my boobs will cause chafing."
"And a T-shirt will make a difference?"
"Yes."
"That doesn't make any sense, you know that right? Because if you have a shirt on, your boobs will rub against that."
"Why do you want me to sleep shirtless anyway?"
"Why do always want me to?" He countered.
I poked his stomach. "I like your abs."
He pulled me flush against him. "I like your chest."
"Perv."
"Only for you."
"That makes no fucking sense you weirdo."
"When do I ever make sense?"
"You usually do..."
"Really? Huh. I hadn't known that."
"That's because you know nothing."
"Wow, you're mean."
"Yup. Get used to it."
Paul laughed and kissed my forehead. "I already have."
"See, now if that was supposed to be sweet, it wasn't."
"How so?"
"Because you basically agreed with me being an ass."
"But-I- what?"
I snorted. "Ha! I got you!"
"You're right. You are an ass."
"Ah finally! I get you to admit it! For the past three years I've been trying to get you to say I was an ass but you never did!"
"You're such a strange person..."
"I know." I smiled cheekily and untangled myself from him.
