I stand in the bathroom, my hands shaky. The pounding music from outside the door is muffled. I pace the room, filling in the empty spaces between four walls and between each tile. My head is spinning and it's all too much. I felt traces of you in the air. I know it's been so long but God so help me, I'll never be over you. Your fingerprints on me are those of a ghost; they're always lingering whether or not you recognize their presence all the time. I can't deal with this. I wish your smile would leave my head, I wish your cold words wouldn't make me feel worse and worse everyday. You were like a drug to me, and I loved to be an addict but apparently, I wasn't the only one addicted to you. Your lies made me want to leave but then again, I knew I couldn't stay away. I want to curl up in the bathtub and sleep forever. I feel physical pain everywhere. When does it all end?
