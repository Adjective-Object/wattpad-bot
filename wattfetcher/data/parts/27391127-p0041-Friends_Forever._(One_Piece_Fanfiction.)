Back to the present...

"What are you stupid or something!" Aya shouted, already having punched Sakura to a pulp.

"No, sorry ma'am." Sakura apologized. The rest of the royal guest looked at the scene in disbelief and Doflamingo was not too far from cracking a laugh.

Sakura looked up and saw the Princess.

"Hi Millie-chan!"
"Hi."
"Notice these things sooner!"  Aya shouted punching her again.
"The pinkette has bipolar issues."
"Yeah."

"By the way," Sakura started, whispering to Aya," Millie-chan isn't safe here. We need to get her out the Catherdal."
"Agreed."

"Minna. You need to evacuate! It's dangerous in here!" Aya shouted so that she could be heard above the sound of the roaring Sky barrier.

As the barrier slowly started to fade, the royal families made their ways out of there.

"Is everything alright?" Twilight asked.
"Don't worry, Millie-chan." Aya comforted
"We'll meet you outside." Sakura continued.

Twilight nodded to show that she understood and went outside wit her siblings.

After all were gone, Haruka walked up with the sniper bound in ropes. He dropped the sniper on the ground gave Sakura a Haki imbued punch.

"Baka. Can't you do shit right!"
"Shut up! Don't you what it feels like to be blown by a grenade? It fucking hurts you know."

"The two of you.." Aya started, her eyebrows twitching, " SHUT UP FOR 5 MINUTES!"

"Who sent you?" Haruka asked.
"Nobody."
"Liar."

"Um, sniper-san.."
"DON'T CALL IT WITH SAN!"

"Why were you sent to kill the princess?" Sakura asked continuing from where she left off.
"Doflamingo asked me to."

"EH? Why?"
"Because he wants to get even with Aya." the sniper reported. Aya stood there in complete shock.

"Anything we don't know?"
"It's nothing so big."
"But for the mad flamingo to get even with you, you must have done something."
