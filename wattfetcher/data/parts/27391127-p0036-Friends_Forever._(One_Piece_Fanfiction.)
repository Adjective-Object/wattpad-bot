Back to the present...

"Wow Millie-chan, that's terrible." Aya said hugging her now crying friend. Millie just pushed her back. She remembered her friend's words.

"Tiger-san said its not nice for little girls to cry."

"Yeah, it is terrible but you know, where there's darkness, there'll always be light. And that light became my hope." Twilight explained looking up at the ceiling.

"Hope?" Aya asked confused. No normal person would see hope in being a slave, especially one for the World Nobles.

During that time, ....

It was unaware to Princess Twilight and Aya that Sakura was eavesdropping. She listened to the whole conversation.

"There was one girl, her name was Asuka."Millie started.

"That name..." Sakura thought. She's heard that name before but she stayed to hear more.

Sakura had suspicions ever since she saw the princess. Maybe this conversation will confirm them.

"Whilst I was a slave, I had friends although we weren't allowed to meet most times. Only in the night when the Nobles were sleeping."

Sakura tensed up. It was her. Her best friend.

"Also I had the privilege of getting to know Fisher Tiger-san."

"Eh? Isn't Fisher Tiger, the mad man who went and freed all the slaves at Mariejios?"

"I see. So that's how the world views him." Twilight said in a sympathetic tone.

Sakura tensed up further. She was already on the verge of tears.

"But I remember my friend Asuka. She and I sang a little song that gave us hope."

"Really, I'd like to hear it."


Then Twilight started to sing,

I'll remember the pain kept buried deep inside.
