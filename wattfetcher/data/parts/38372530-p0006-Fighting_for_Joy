I moved from on top of her and she covered her chest with the sheets
"Mommy, Daddy. Mels-Mels and I want ice cream." Cara said smiling.
"Um no. It's breakfast time." Lauren said getting into mommy mode.
"Mama please." Cara pleaded.
"Maybe after lunch but not now. No." Lauren said and shook her head.
Cara sighed. "I guess that's okay."
"Good, now you two go and brush teeth. I'll be inside your rooms to bathe you in a few minutes okay?" Lauren said
"Yes ma'am." Cara said and ran off to her room.
I sighed and put my hands behind my head.
"We got two kids. Why don't we lock the door?" I asked her and she shrugged.
"We've got to get in the habit of doing that because number 3 is on its way." She sighed casually.
"Speaking of number three, let me work on putting that inside you."'I said kissing her neck she giggled as I got out of bed and locked the door.
"Baby." She called as I locked the door.
"Hmm?" I asked.
"We don't have to work on that." She said.
I thought about it, we don't have to work on that? What she mean. I turned around and she stood with a sticker on her stomach that reads "Baby Thomas on board here" and a pregnancy test in her hand.
"Surprise." She said smiling and I couldn't help but laugh as I hugged her tightly.
"We really having a baby?" I asked her hugging her and she nodded.
"Yes sir." She laughed. "I have fifteen tests to prove it."
I looked down at the tests and sure enough, we are pregnant.
"Wow." I said
"You happy?" She asked me
"Yes."I smiled. "I'm very happy. Thank you." I kissed her lips and she kissed mine back.
Now, I'm sitting here, just siting here without my wife and without my child. Although out her pregnancy she was beautiful. So flawless the way she would sit in the house with her shirt up showing off her belly and rubbing it. This pregnancy wasn't what I wanted for her. I wanted her to be happy. I wanted us all to be happy.
"D-daddy." Cara said yanking on my jacket.
I sighed and covered my face. She is not to see my cry. "Yes baby?" I asked her.
"I-is mommy okay?" She said lowly.
I shook my head, fishing to find what to say. "I don't know baby."
"Grandma is here. S-she sad. I said too daddy." Cara said with one little tear coming down her cheek.
I hugged her tightly to me. "Baby girl, I promise to you that things will get better." I said and kissed her hair.
Things will get better. They have to get better. I just hope it's soon. I rocked Cara in the chair until she fell asleep.
My brother came and touched my arm. "I'm sorry man." He said grabbing my arm.
I nodded my head. Not saying anything. My mind at the moment running a mile a minute. It's been about four hours and no information on neither my wife or my child.
