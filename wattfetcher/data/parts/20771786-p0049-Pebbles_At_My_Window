"No,no," she came to me and pulled me back to sit down. "He told me I was stupid to like him, that he would never be with me, and that... That he doesn't want to be in my stupid movie life."
Every word she spoke her voice got raspier and the more tears that fell. I felt sorry for her. Sure there were other guys that made her cry but not this much. I hug her shaking body trying to comfort her. I awkwardly sat there looking around the room.
She pulled away and the tears were now inexistent. Olivia took a deep breath.
"Damnit."
"What?" I questioned.
"I'm not supposed to be crying." She pathetically laughed at herself. "At this point I should go back to normal."
I chuckled at her. The only thing that I thought about was when she was younger and she ran into the screen door. She cried for 2 seconds then hopped up and continued to go out the door and play like nothing happened.
"Maybe you're still crying because you still care."
My sister looked at me like I was a unicorn with 2 heads. The moment I looked back at her, she just shook her head.
She got up, pulled me up from her bed, and gave me a real hug. I hugged her back. I don't remember the last time we had a a good sibling hug.
"How come my little brother is smarter than me about life?"
"Because I'm just simply better"
She laughed inside my ear loudly which made me wince back which only made her laugh more and she wouldn't let go. I just hope she gets the movie life she always wanted, even if it's totally ridiculous.
