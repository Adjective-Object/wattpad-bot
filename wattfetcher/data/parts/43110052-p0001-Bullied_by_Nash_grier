Alexis POV:
ALEXIS! ALEXIS!" My dad yelled from down stairs as I was currently up in my room trying to pick up the pieces of glass from the vase I just accidentally knocked over. I was trying to pick them up as fast as I could before my dad noticed when he gets up here. Ugh I always have to screw up at the worst times ugh I'm so clumsy.Suddenly the door burst open and my dad standing there with a beer bottle in his hand looking pissed as ever "you worthless bitch you just always have to be braking stuff don't you!" he yelled As I was shaking getting ready to get a slap or kick. My dad was always like this when I gothome he was either drunk, passsed out, or out getting a drink. Ever since my mother passed away due to cancer when I was only 12. He use to be a loving father, a caring husband, a different man than he is now, since the accident he's not the same man he was back then. Everyday I fear of him kicking, slapping, even punching me and getting called worthless, bitch, slut you name it. he always has to be blaming me for my mothers death and saying I should have been the one. I miss her she was always so nice and caring we were so close and after that day she passed I was not the same girl I once was. Now I'm a depressed, worthless girl with a abusive dad saying I was a mistake.I was cut out of my thoughts when I felt a sting to my cheek and then getting kicked in the side twice last thing I saw was my dad walking out slamming the door then I blacked out.
Next morning I woke up on the ground with a minor headache so I got up and went to shower. As I got in I was thinking why me. Why does he have to let all his anger out on me. It's not fair then I thought life isn't fair. My mom passed, I get bullied, I have no one, my dad treats me like shit, I don't even have a reason to be here all I'm here for is to be someone's punching bag and let me tell you something that's one of the few things I'm good at. I got out the shower and got dressed in a over sized long sleeved shirt that I tucked in and pulled out some of my  high waisted shorts with my white converse. And for my makeup and hair some mascara and eyeliner with foundation and a little bit of blush then I left my brown wavy hair down with a maroon beanie and called it good. I started walking down stairs. I was just hoping my dad was still sleeping or still passed out cause I was not looking forward to be greeted by him this morning. I called it clear when I didn't notice his presence so I hurried and grabbed a apple and left out the door to get to school "notice the sarcasm" Once I pulled in I got out and started heading towards the entrances. I walked in then stared heading towards my locker to get my books for my first class then I heard a way to familiar voice yell "hey bitch" my way and when I turned around I saw Nash Grier with two of his friends that always follow him come my way.
