"She will not." Law objected, putting Aya behind her.
"Just go down the slide already lovebirds!" Sakura said playfully, pushing Aya and Luffy onto the slide. Upon impact, Luffy wrapped his arms around Aya's waist and Aya was just too embarrassed to even look up.
"Why you.." Law started.
"Were you saying something Trafalgar?" Sakura teased taking his hat and putting it on her head.
"How old are you?"
"I can't tell you that. You ready, Ace?" Sakura asked, giving the hat back to Law. Law just pushed them onto the slide as that apparently seems to be the way of the day. Law just sighed before activating his 'Room'.
To Each of the lovely couples~
"Get the hell away from me bitch!"
"You took the words right out of my mouth."
"Then unwrap your legs!"
"As if I could do that!"
Elsewhere...
"Aya, why is your face red? Do you have a fever?"
"No, I don't. I just want to get off this damn ride!"
"Shambles."
"Huh? Oi!" Luffy shouted as he saw Aya cuddled in Law's chest.
"Um.." Aya started but couldn't finish. Her now pink face had now turned a very deep scarlet.
"Oi! Traffy! I was with Aya first!"
"She's my girlfriend, Mugiwara-ya."
"G-girlfr-friend?"
"No way, She was mine first!"
"Do you even know what that word means?"
"Yes! She a girl that's my friend." Luffy shouted before tackling both Law and Aya. Aya was trapped under the two males as her head that hit the water slide. Law, however, was slowly turning red from the closeness of Aya to him. Luffy on the other hand was laughing like an idiot.
Law had then wrapped himself and Aya behind Luffy but that did not prevent Luffy from wrapping himself around Aya from behind.
"Let go of her, Mugiwara-ya!"
"Never."
"I..." Aya started. Law and Luffy stopped arguing to look at the pinkette.
".....feel sick." Aya replied lifting her head up.
"Motion Sickness!"
And meanwhile....
"This is really fun!" Sakura said excitedly looking up at Ace.
"Y-Yeah, it is," Ace answered looking away.
"Why is your face red?" Sakura asked poking it.
"N-no reason."
"Liar."
"I'm not lying!"
"Then say so silly." Sakura answered him, flashing him a genuine smile. This only made him redder.
Now to the best part.
"Why the hell are you still stuck to me!"
"I could ask the same thing." Haruka answered calmly. He looked up and saw a sign saying, 'Lover's Tunnel.'
"Da hell?"
