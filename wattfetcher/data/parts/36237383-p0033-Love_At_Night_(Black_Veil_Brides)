"The only thing that I kept from you is my past. The reason that I didn't say anything is because I don't want to remember and that I'm horribly ashamed of what I did..." He looks down and his hair covers his face. He grabs a guards gun and sets it to his temple"
"If I am of no longer needed here then I shall face my punishment in Hell..." A guard places a collar around his neck that stops him from changing or hurting himself. Andy laughs madly and menacingly and looks at the guard who placed the collar on his neck and both eyes are black and both have red irises. He grabs the collar and rips it off even though it burns his hand. Andy slamned it into the ground and gets on all fours and yells which change into a deafening howl. He punches the ground and changes completely. His roar shatters all the windows and the guards start shooting at him but the bullets bounce off. Gerard grabs me and drags me away. Andy appears in front of us. I push Gerard behind me as Andy looks down at me. I see a small sliver of sanity in his eyes.
"Kill me then" I say. He raises his hand and swings at me but stops an 1/8 away from me. I feel the wind from his swing and it blows my hair back. He lowered his hand and began to change back.
"Best of luck with the child Kat. I would of stayed with you but it seems that I'm not wanted by you. In my true form I'm able to see people's energy networks. I saw a small energy network growing inside your womb." He turns away and head towards the window again.
"How do think I was able to wipe out that branch of vampires on my own? I was in my true form and what you just saw was my true from." He says
"You nearly hurt me." I say calmly.
"The only reason I stopped is because of our child growing inside you." He jumps to a window edge and stops. Gerard gets up and the music starts blasting again. He takes me to a elevator.Andy appears in front of me.
"Kat..."
"Andy.."I say as the elevator doors close.
