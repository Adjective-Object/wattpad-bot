Flash Back
Its Been A Couple Of Years Since Everything Happened. I Remember It Like It Was Yesterday. I Closed My Eyes As Everything Came Rushing Back.
I Was Standing Over Jasmine Shaking My Head. I Squat Down Over Her, She Had 4 Bullets In Her. She Was Coughing Up Blood
"Jas You Should Have Let It Go. You Try To Use Me Now Kill Me. Im Not That Fragile Girl Trust & Believe Sweetie"
I Stood Up & Shot Her In The Head. I Couldn't Risk Her Just Bleeding Out Or Some How Living. We Found Krista Shaking In A Conner Behind A Chair. Marcus My Dads Best Shooter Picked Her Up. We Walked Out Of There Like Nothing Happened. My Father Had The Warehouse Set On Fire.
I Wasn't Surprise When He Showed Up With His Boys & Chris. Lexus Was In A Truck With Nick. We All Got In Our Cars & Back To The Airport We Went.
Flash Back Ends
I Opened My Eyes To Chris Standing Over Me. I Raised An Eyebrow & Titled My Head At Him. He Just Smiled Of Course Showing His Dimples. I Sat Up On The Couch Giving Him My Full Attention.
"Yes Giant How May I Help You?"
"By Getting Up & Finish Packing You Know How Ya Dad Is"
"I Finish When I Want To & You Two Will Still Being Alive"
"Hurry Up Smart Ass Before I Beat Your Ass"
"You Pussy So Shut Up Giant"
I Got Up Running Out The Room Laughing. He Was Always Talking Shit Like He Was Going To Do Something. I Started Packing My Second Suit Case. We Were Leaving College To Visit Our Dads.
With All Our High GPA's We Got Into UCLA. Chris Is The Star Quarter Back & Marcus Is Star Running Back His Right Hand. While Me & Lexus Are Cheerleaders & We Play Volley Ball. I Only Did It For Her & To Be As Normal As Can Be. I Walked Out The Room With My Suit Cases Smiling At Chris. He Shook His Head & Took Them.
We Picked Up Lexus & Marcus & Went To The Airport. We Were Back Home In No Time. This Time We Were Going To New York My Dad Said He Had A Surprise For Me. I Couldn't Wait I Loved Gifts From My Dad They Were Always The Best.
We Just Landed In New York & I Was So Sleepy. I Sat In The Car Laying On Chris Shoulder Holding His Hand. I Fell Asleep In No Time. I Was Dreaming About Me & Chris. I Was Trying To Figure Out When We Would Have Sex For The First Time. He Was Waiting For Me To Be Ready But I Always Freeze & Got Scared.
I Woke Up An Hour Later In A Bed. I Sat Up Looking Around The Room Was Really Nice. I Heard A Knock On The Door Then Lexus Ran In & Jumped On Me.
"Hey Babes You Finally Awake"
"Haha Yea & Im Hungry So Lets Go Out"
"Okay Lets Dress Like Twins, I Miss Our Dads Getting Confused"
"Lol Okay Where Chris & Marcus?"
"In The Game Room With Our Dad's"
I Got Up & Showered & Got Dressed. Lexus Did My Hair & Make Up. I Was Dressed To Kill. We Were Going To Sneak Out But I Wanted To See My Daddy. I Texted Him To Come Here. Once He Enter I Jumped On Him. I'll Always Be His Baby Girl. He Spun Me Around In A Circle Kissing My Forehead.
"Hows The Princess"
"Awesome Me & Lexus Going To Get A Few Things You Can't Tell The Boys."
