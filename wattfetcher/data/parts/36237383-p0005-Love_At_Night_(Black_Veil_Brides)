"Im sorry." I said dropping my head.
"I don't blame you for fearing a monster..." He said looking down as his hair covered his face. I walked over towards him.
"Im a monster too." I said and lightly touched his hand. It felt tense and I looked into his blue eyes only to see sadness. I removed his hair from his eyes.
"He was going to kill you last night." I say mentioning Ashley. His eyes adverted from mine.
"I was unprepared and I was distracted last time." He said as my eyes turn a dark green color. He moved away with the great sword clenched tightly in his hand. He manoeuvred the sword with speed and ease.
"What were you distracted by?" I asked. He slid the sword along the ground towards me.
"By your beauty miss. I have enough strength to take care of myself and you" He answered. I scoffed.
"I can take care of myself." I say. He nodded slowly thinking.
"But you dont have the stomach to kill someone. Pick it up and hit me as hard as you can." Andy said. I eyed off the sword on the ground. He raised his eyebrows at me. The thought of me hitting him or even hurting him made me upset. I turned my back and faced the window.
"See miss Kat... you dont have the stomach."
