“He said he took no pictures of us. I’m gonna’ take his word for it.” He smiled.
“Am I hearing things correctly? He is lying!”
“If what you’re saying is true, then what’s wrong with it?”
“Are you serious? Do you hear what you’re saying Ice? Of course there’s gonna’ be a lot of problems once that picture gets out!” I can’t believe Ice. He clearly likes what’s happening right now.
“Yes. I told you I’m serious. If you’re that concerned about the picture, then you should’ve tried to stop me earlier. Heh. Why didn’t you anyway?”
“…” Told you, Chase! He is getting the wrong idea. You should’ve stopped everything when he tried a move on you. You’re such a dumbass, stupid!
“I’ll be taking my leave now Chase. Class is about to start. See you later… love.” He winked as he mentioned the word, ‘love’.

I was left in a state of shock.
==========================================================
I rushed outside the classroom as soon as the clock ticked Four-Thirty. I need to confirm things with Art. I need to know if he took any pictures and if he did, I need to make him delete it. I can’t imagine what happens when it gets out. First, people will be like, ‘What the hell?’ and after some time we will be considered a ‘thing’. “What the fuck am I thinking? Me and Ice, a thing? That can’t happen! There’s no freaking way!”
I walked as fast as I can towards the Newspaper Club Room. Luckily, they were still in a meeting so I still have a chance but, what if… what if he already showed it to everyone in the club?
“Pearl! I have a huge scoop. This is finally the break we deserve. Second Year’s Top One and Two are having a forbidden romance!”
“Whaaaaaaat? How did you know? Do you have any evidence of this? Pictures first.”
“Of course I have. Here you go.” Art hands out his camera to Pearl. Pearl’s eyes widens at the image she sees.
“OMG! It’s real! This is intense. OMG! OMG! Imagine the school’s misery once they learn that their idols are gay!” Pearl squeals out with joy as she boasts to all the members what Art has showed her. “Here you go guys, take a look.”
The Newspaper Club room was filled with uproar! Everyone has comments about me and Ice almost kissing. There was one girl who nearly fainted at the sight of the image (as she was shipping ‘us’ ever since our Freshmen days). There’s also this scumbag guy who expressed his disgust over it. Over-all, the reactions were pretty much overwhelming!
“No…No… No! I hope not!” I tried to erase everything that I’ve recently thought of. My imagination can be cruel at times. I really hope Art is considerate enough to not show the picture to Pearl. Once he does, it will surely spread like wildfire (knowing how Pearl’s mind works)!
The meeting has finally ended and it seemed like nothing’s been disclosed about the picture. I gave out a sigh of relief as the members walk out of the room one by one without giving me a weird look. Art stepped out of the room with his camera still in hand. I approached him and asked him directly about the picture.
“Hey Art! Can you show me the picture you took earlier at the library?” Of course, I assumed he took the picture already. Baiting mechanics, that is.
