For socially awkward Anastasia-Belle Monroe life was as easy as pie: go to school, get good grades, don't attract attention, then find a job that pays well and then live life as you please. But this year fate had other ideas in store.
Sir Alexander Fitzgerald Academy is a prestigious boarding school for the overly intelligent - that is where her parents were sending Anastasia for her final year of school. She quickly becomes branded as the "new girl" and realises that maybe life might not be as simple as it seems...
Especially when she's catching the eyes of people that she would much rather avoid and capturing the hearts of those that she would much rather forget and attracting attention like bees to honey.
Let's just say, she's in for a rollercoaster ride as past collides with present.
