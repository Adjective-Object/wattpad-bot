At that moment, something clicked inside of their heads
"NANI!" Brook shouted.
"DON'T PUT US IN YOUR SHIT!" Usopp screamed
'WE DIDN'T STEAL THE FOOD. YOU DID!" Chopper screamed.
"WE ONLY ATE WHAT WAS LEFT!!!" Sakura shouted.
"Bakas, they shouldn't have admitted anything." Haruka muttered sweatdropping.
"They're doing a SUPER suckish job at lying."Franky said doing his pose.
"Stop that."
"Sanji, don't listen to them. The tanuki did it! he stole the food!" Luffy said pointing to Chopper.
"I'M A REINDEER and plus Usopp did it!'
"No, no,no. Brook did it." Usopp defended pointing to Brook.
"But i didn't do it Sanji-san."
"SAKI-CHAN/SAKURA WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THIS." They all shouted pointing to Sakura.
"Well, I did tell them to take a little but I wouldn't think they'll take that much." Sakura stated with tears in her eyes.
"Its okay, Sakura-chwan! I'll forgive you."
"DON'T JUST FORGIVE HER!" Everyone shouted.
as everyone was fighting (referring to Sanji, Luffy, Chopper, Usopp,Brook) Robin, Nami and Aya noticed a huge dinosaur behind them.
"KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Nami shouted and that's when...
"Oh, meat!" Ace noted.
"You better taste good you damn dinosaur."
"I'll slice his ass!"
"Don't let him get away. He better be worth cooking!"
Then the dinosaur started to slowly back away...
