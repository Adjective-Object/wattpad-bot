I put my phone down and went downstairs. No one home, as usual. I got out snacks and put them on the counter. I also got red solo cups and lots of beer and wine bottles that my dad keeps in his cooler and I keep in my safe. I set them on the counter also and called Corey and Will. After, I found my packs of my cigarettes and set them on the coffee table.
Mallory:I looked through my closet and drawers to find something to wear. After about ten minutes, I decided on a blue sweater, black skinny jeans, and white wedges. I put it on and went to the bathroom to put on my makeup. I put on natural makeup and light pink lipgloss. I never like eye popping makeup.
I put on my wedges and a couple of silver bracelets. It was 4:57. I went downstairs and saw Corey. "Are you ready yet, slut?" He asked. I nodded and we walked next door to River's house. Corey rang the doorbell and I saw River open the door. He let us in and I looked in the kitchen. I then saw Corey pull River aside and talk to him.
River:"Okay Phoenix. This time, since it's a party, you can do whatever you want with Mallory." Corey whispered. I looked over his shoulder to see Mallory just standing there. I looked back at Corey and nodded. The doorbell rang again and I saw Wil and some other people. I let them in and Mallory saw Wil and pushed away a little bit. It was cute. Wait what? What am I saying?
