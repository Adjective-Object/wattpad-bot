Well Hey! You made it as far as to open this so I'm going to try not to keep on talking and let you get to the actually book.
So this is my newest book on wattpad and I'm really just trying to get a feel for creative writing.
Wow it's so surreal for me.
Anyway, I just want to dedicate this to my "Awesome Aussie" Kat {@Kat3546}. She's so sweet, encouraging, and a REALLY good writer! You guys should go check out her book "Thrown Together, Literally," you won't regret!
Just some warnings:
-There will be some "profanity" or swear words occasionally.
-There a bit of self harm type of stuff at the beginning mostly
-I edit the chapters but nobody's perfect so please feel free to point out any mistakes I may have made (as long as those aren't like the ONLY things you comment)

I will not have a cast section because no single person in whole can fit the image I have in my mind of the characters. Instead, I'll just have pictures depicting them

Thanks!
