When she mouthed, "What's wrong," I mouthed back to her, "Nothing."
She didn't seemed convinced.
I was tired and just wanted to cry and go home. Plus the meeting was pointless.
I got up and walked to the closet beside the door and took out my coat.
I opened the door and walked out, I turned around to close it and briefly thought about whether or not I should say goodbye, but it's not like they would notice, I thought with a grim look on my face.
I closed the door and walked to my jeep. I got in and put the key in the ignition. My jeep turned on and I drove and left the Hale household to go home.
When I got home, I saw that my dad wasn't home, which probably meant that he was called to go to work.
I parked my car in the driveway, and got out the jeep. I locked my jeep, and walked up to my front door. I took out the house key and opened up the door.
I stepped in and closed the door. I walked into the kitchen and saw a note from dad saying,
"Hey buddy, I hope the meeting was good. Sorry I know I promised no work, but apparently it was an emergency. I'll be home in the morning for breakfast. Love you, Dad."
I rolled my eyes. Yeah emergency my ass.
I sluggishly walked up the stairs to my bedroom. I quickly changed into my pyjamas and got into my bed.
I thought about today's events and wondered why Derek would do that to me.
I was so caught up in my thoughts that I didn't notice that I had tears running down my face. I wiped then away and sighed and tried to go to sleep.
I finally managed to fall asleep that I didn't notice the glowing red eyes saying me with concern.
