I had the girls in 5th period, and I told them about Stone and Sabian. "I bet they're both gonna start liking you," Shelby winked. I shook my head. "Nooo." I said. "You never know," Hannah said and Claudia nodded. "What if you start liking one of them?" Hannah said, gasping. "What about Gavin?" Shelby asked. I shrugged. "I doubt that'll happen," I said, laughing. "I've seen Sabian before, he's really cute." Claudia said. "I've seen Stone before." Shelby said. "I haven't seen neither of them." Hannah said.
Soon, it was the end of 8th period and I had Stone and Sabian again. "Oh, here's my number, and here's Stone's number," I took the piece of paper and typed in their numbers into my phone. "Just in case you ever need anything... Or if you just wanna hang out with us." Sabian said, smiling. "Okay," I laughed. The bell rang to release us and I saw Shelby and caught up with her. "Hey!" I said. "Heyyy!" She hugged me. We walked back to our dorm and changed into our comfy clothes and went through our social medias. I found Stone and Sabian on Instagram and Twitter and followed them. I put my phone down and decided take a nap.
Today has been a good first day.
