"What...do you exactly mean by that, frau?" Prussia asked.
"Let's sign this paper as the humans that I am and you guys  are now. In other words, you guys could come up with human names for yourselves and sign with them..." I explained.
Canada smiled and nodded. "I see! If anyone else sees it, they won't understand it, because it's not signed with nation names!"
"But what about you, love?" England asked me as I met his gaze.
I paused for a moment and looked up in thought. "I guess I'll sign it with my nickname, that way, it'll be different?"
"A human name, not Romano...Hmm, sounds good. What do you think, Veneziano?" Romano inquired, turning to his younger brother.
Italy nodded excitedly. "Yeah, I approve! If we do that,we can all form an alliance!" he turned to face me and continued, "Even with the bella here!"
"Th-Thanks." I said, happy that they like the idea. It's just as it was in the game...but now that I'm actually a part of it...it feels a whole lot better.
America took a pen and thought for a moment. "I'll be... let's see... Al... er...Alfred F. Jones, I guess!" he said as he wrote on the paper. He then passed it to his brother, who was beside him.
"Matthew Williams." Canada said softly as he wrote.
After Canada signed, China took the paper and exclaimed as he wrote. "Wang Yao!"
"Gilbert Beilschmidt! How's that? Pretty awesome, huh?!" Prussia said in a proud voice as he signed.
France flipped his hair and signed on the paper. "Then I'll be Francis Bonnefoy."
"I think I'll be Ivan Braginsky." Russia said after thinking for a moment.
Spain reached for the paper and began signing whilst announcing his name. "I'll be Antonio Fernandez Carriedo. Oh, there isn't enough space..." he said, noticing that his name was too long.
"All right, I've got it! I'm Arthur Kirkland!" England exclaimed as he reached for the paper.
When it was Germany's turn, he still couldn't think of a name. "Th-then I'll be... Ludwig. This is kind of awkward." he said in embarrassed tone.
"Can I be... Lovino Vargas?" Romano asked as he stared at the paper in front of him.
Italy nodded happily. Yup! Then I'll be...Feliciano! Feliciano Vargas!"
"Then I am... Honda Kiku." Japan said as he wrote his name. He then handed it over to me.
I gave a small smile as I received the paper. I started to grow nervous.. this is really happening. I took a deep breath and signed the paper.
"...And I'm (Nickname) (Last Name)".
I handed the paper over to America after signing. He inspected the paper and looked around him. "All right, everyone signed! That makes this vow absolute!Right, Kiku?" he said, turning to Japan.
"What? Oh--are you talking to me? Er... Indeed!We must all abide by it, Arthur!" Japan said.
America shook his head. "... No, my name is Alfred...Arthur is England..."
"O-Oh! I-I'm sorry! My memory these days..." Japan apologised, clutching his head.
