My whole life has been revolved around quotes. Intellectual quotes, thoughtful quotes, silly quotes. I loved spending hours reading books about quotes, spending hours on the internet researching new quotes, spending hours pondering about what those quotes meant. They made me feel like I understood everything about life when I finally realized what one meant. It was like the quotes were a part of me. It was like they understood me.
My favorite quote of all time is an anonymous quote. "Every cloud has a silver lining." I had that quote everywhere. It was plastered on my walls, on my locker, it was the lock screen on my phone. That quote stuck out to me more than anything. It showed me that even when I knew things wouldn't go right, something good will come out of it. Boy, was I ever wrong.
