The guard led me down the hall to the interrogation room I knew all to well.
I cringed when I heard the shrieks from other victims.
Why does it have to be like this. I thought. The guard stopped at room 33. I swallowed hard, then stepped in. My mind was racing. What would they have planned for me today.
In the room was a black leather chair and table beside it with different tools to make you cooporate. It had door, with metal walls like my cell. But one had a window with bars to keep people in, and to also keep people out. I stared at it for a long while until I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. I closed my eyes.
He was here.
I turned to see Agent Ward. His tight shield uniform showing of his toned muscles.
"Sit." He commanded, pointing towards the leather chair.
"Thanks for asking nicely." I said flatly. I could see the rage starting to bubble up behind his eyes so I shut up. Sarcasm would mean a more painful interrogation. I walked over to the middle of the room there the chair was, and sat down.
Then, Ward tied my wrists and ankles to the chair. I just sat there, feeling wide awake now.
"Now," he said, taking the first instrument in his hand,"where is he?" I bit my lip, trying to keep from saying a snarky remark. "Tell me." he insisted. I stared at the long metal piece in his hands. It was almost like a mini chainsaw. I hated this one. And he knew it. He flicked the switch to turn it on and it fired to life. I took in a deep breath. He grabbed my throat and held the mini-saw up my neck. "Tell me now!" He yelled so loud my ears started to throb.
"We've been doing this everyday for the last 2 months, and the only thing you've gotten out of me is sarcasm." I said smirking. He dug the mini saw into my neck. The pain was unbearable. Tiny little knives biting into the sensitive flesh. I closed my eyes and imagined I was on a beach somewhere tropical like Hawaii. I always did this when the pain was getting to be to much. He started off with the hard one. I thought. He's impatient today.
I gasped as he took the weapon away from my neck. "In a hurry are we?" I said gulping down fresh air. I didn't even realize I had been holding it in. I felt blood started to trickle down my neck onto the floor. Something flickered in his eyes. Guilt? I though. No way. There's no way he would feel guilty for this, it's his job.
"We're done here. Your free to go back to your cell." He said storming out and slamming the door. I sat there stunned. Mostly because he left me tied up and there wasn't much I could do to move, and second, he felt something. Maybe he's not the emotionless robot I thought he was.
No. You can't start thinking this way, he's the enemy. He doesn't care about you. He's playing with your mind.
But in a strange way, I think I felt something for him too.
