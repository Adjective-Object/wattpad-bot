Authors Warning:
This is an authors note but not really, as it says: Authors Warning.This story is a world created in my head; it's made up, if not, an enhancement of something that is not-so made up. So, if anything is incorrect, it's just my point of view on the subject and I'm not saying it a proven fact.
P.SMy imagination is full of abundant none-sense-ness.
