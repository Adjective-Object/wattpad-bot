"Oh god, did I have sex with you and forget? No, please, no, you're so hot though. I hate Jo. She did this. Alcoholic bitch," Dean said.
"Uh. No, you didn't have sex with me. And, uh, you're not so bad yourself, in the... hotness department. And, in case you were wondering, I found you collapsed in my front yard," Cas said, not mentioning what he sang, and setting a plate of eggs and bacon (and water and two aspirin) in front of Dean and sitting next to him, with his own plate.
"Well, that's a shame." Dean examined the plate in front of him. "So, let me get something straight."
"Yes, Dean?"
"I went out for drinks with Jo, because she was mad about Dr. Whats-His-Face getting engaged. Her gynecologist." Dean shook his head, but continued. "I know I had some weird dreams, but I think I remember running into your birdbath?" he admitted sheepishly.
Cas laughed. "It's fine, I hated that thing. Gift from my sister, Naomi." He signaled for Dean to go on.
"I distinctly remember bright blue," he said, looking into Cas' eyes.
"Blue?" Cas breathed out, noting the distance between them. Nearly nothing, by the way.
At that moment, Dean's phone rang.
Dean groaned at the loudness of the ringtone. He grabbed the phone from his pocket. Major Cockblock Calling. Well, that's not what it said, but it should've. Dean made a mental note to change Jo to Major Cockblock in his contacts later.
"What?" he answered, annoyed. "Okay. Mhmm." He began to write something on a piece of paper while Jo was talking. "Got it. Be there soon. Wait, where's my car?" Pause. "It's where?" Pause. "Okay, Jo. Yes. I understand. Five minutes."
"Sorry, Cas," Dean began. "Guess you'll have to get the goods some other time." He kissed Cas on the cheek and handed him the piece of paper. "Call me," he whispered in his ear before walking out the door.
Yep, that ass decided it.
Cas would be calling Dean. Soon.
