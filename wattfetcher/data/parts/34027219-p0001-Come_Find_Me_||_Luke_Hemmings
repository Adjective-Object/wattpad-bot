*LUKE'S POV*
I come to the bar and the bartender immediately smiles at me and asks me what I want.Â "Ten shots of vodka. Please bring it to our table" I say and slightly smile at the bartender and he nods. Me and my band just came back home from the world tour and we decided to go out with our friends. Well it's mostly girlfriend thing, but apparently, I'm the only one who is single. I know I could have any girl I would just point at, but the problem is, I still didn't find the one I could be interested in. Then I hear a growl from behind me. I turn around and see the girl with long brown hair who waste her time by trying to catch the attention of the bartender. I can't help myself but smile.
*MADISON'S POV*
I am standing next to the bar like 20 minutes and wasting my time by trying to catch the attention of the bartender. It kinda seems like he's ignoring me or what. Why did I even agree with an idea to go clubbing? Yeah, right it's my brother's birthday. Yeah, my big brother just turns 21 tonight. Oh, wait, hold on. Let me introduce myself. I am Madison Morgan, just an ordinary 17 years old girl from Sydney. I am not even special. My friends are telling me that I could be a model, but I really don't like to be a center of the attention. I hate these embarassing situations like when you're in store and you accidently throw down something and everyone is staring at you. Well, like I said before, I have a big brother who just turns 21. His name is Nathan and we're getting on really well. I could say that I can tell him anything. I heard from lots of people they're fighting with their sibling, but it's not our situation. We love each other. Suddenly I finally see the bartender coming my way and I breathe in just like you breath in when you're gonna say something, but he actually stops in front of the guy who definitely just get there. I look at him from his head to toes and realize it's that guy from that band. What's their name? Well, I can't remember, but whatever. I think he just told to the bartender his order, because he nods. I growl at how unfair this world is and then the boy turns to me with his face. Well, I'm not facing him, but I see he's looking at me now by the corner of my eye. I wave at the bartender one more time, already ready to give up. I slide down from the stool ready to leave, when I suddenly feel someone stops me.
*LUKE'S POV*
She slide down from the stool ready to leave, but then I wrap my hand around her elbow. I don't even know why I did it, don't even ask me. I just did. She looks up at me and I just turn my head when the bartender comes to us. "Any problem here Mr Hemmings?" he asks. "No. Just take an order from this lady" I say and when I look back at her, her eyes just widened. "What would lady wish?" the bartender asks her. "One Margarita" she says. "Put it on my bill" I tell him and he nods again, then leaves. "Thanks" she mutters at me and I don't get what I did wrong. I smile at her and she just shakes her head. "What's your name?" I ask her, believe in the fact we can have some conversation. When the bartender brings her the drink, she takes it, rolls her eyes and just leaves me standing there.
*MADISON'S POV*
Oh God. Why me? Well, he just bought me a drink, I could be a little nicer to him. But I just wasn't feeling confident around him, and I just felt all of these people staring at us. Yeah, I mean, he's in a band. He gets all the attention. Honestly, I don't know what he was thinking, but anyway. Just him buying me a drink can spread the stupid rumours. I just hope that tomorrow there won't be anything like stuff that we're dating or what. I'm really not into the guys like him. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he just gets attention. I hate attention.
*LUKE'S POV*
"Who's that girl?" Calum immediately asks me when I get back to the table. "I don't know" I tell him and shrug. "Madison" our friend Dylan suddenly says. I look at him and raise my eyebrow. "Her name is Madison" Dylan explains. "Do you know her?" I ask him. I want to know more about her. I have a feeling deep inside of me, that she's different, that she has something special in herself. "No, but I know her brother" he says and motions his head to one of the tables. I look there and she's standing next to the boy, who I assume to be her brother. Well, I hope it's him. Then some other guy comes to her and she goes with him to the dancefloor.
