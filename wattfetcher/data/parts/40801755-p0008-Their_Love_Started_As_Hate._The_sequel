"I swear you better not drink," I told rose, she huffed and nodded I could hear the music already and we weren't even in the place,
It was dark except from the strobe lights at the dance floor, luke walked up and looked me up and down smirking at me, "hi I'm Luke," I smiled and he took me to the booth.
"What drinks?" Luke asked, "oh, it's okay I'll get them," like shook his head "no," o rolled my eyes and walked to the bar with Luke behind, I was quite curious on what he was looking at, "what do you want?" Like asked as we reached the bar.
"She'll have a diet coke," I heard a sexy voice say, wait what? "What are you doing here?" He paused, "just saying hi I guess," he smiled rubbing the back of his neck, "what are you doing here?" My time to pause, "I'm on a..date with Luke," I pierced my lips and rocked back and forth on my feet,
"Emily you coming," luke called "yeah," "Luke, Mark, mark, Luke," "yeah I know," I started to walk away with a slight wave of the hand towards Mark, but not long till I was being pulled back I knocked against his lower area with my bum, being in his arms again feels so go- the feeling of his lips brushing and touching my ear with his lips, butterfly's flew around my stomach with every movement.
"If you need just call me," he whisper I nodded and he let go of my I walked away and sat at the booth, "what was that," I don't know the many times I seen you jumps and blush whenever you'd touched," Rose said nodding towards Mark,
I rolled my eyes and listened into the conversation That was going on without me.

"Let's go dance," I slurred giggling at the girls, the looked at me nervously then looked at each other, I tutted "you are so boring coming Luke," I got up and the girls followed I swayed my hips over to the dance floor.
Luke came over and I got a bit carried away I grinned on him, he turned me around and put his big ugly lips on me, "ew,"
I turned around and slapped him, I heard a punches "the fuck you can touch her," "go rape someone else," Mark looked up at me and grabbed me, "you're leaving now," I wanted to cry I opened my mouth to protest, "don't Emily, you shouldn't have even talked to him, let alone dress like that,"
ouch, I liked my dress, we walked out of the club and to his car, "did he spike you're drink," I giggled, "no," i slurred, "coke and vodka," He hit the car wheel "oh someone mad," she giggled
and pouted, "you're dads gonna kill you," "you can't go home like this," "nope where we gonna go, a different club?" He looked at me narrowing his eyes a little, I giggled "I'm only kicking baby," I poured and ruffled his hair,

The car came to a stop, my head hurt like hell, is the drink feeling going away?
I was lifted bridal style by Mark, "I can walk you know," he sighed and put me down, I looked around the world was spinning, okay maybe not, I looked around it looked familiar, wait this was our house.
Mark clearer his throat as he seen the realisation in my face on where I was, "I couldn't take you home your dad-" I put my hand up cutting him off, "this once was my home I know I'll be safe it's all good," I wobbled on my feet a little and grabbed marks arm for support,
It was quite when we got in Mark gave me an aspirin and at shirt to wear to bed, I got into the bed the room was a mess, I didn't see the feast of the house because I didn't want to, finish and clothes everywhere, typical boy, the door opened and traveled a shirt less Mark, oh god, I turned around and the smell of marks aftershave flew into my nostrils.
