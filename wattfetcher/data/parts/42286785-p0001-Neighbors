Hey! I'm writing a new story! It is a fanfic, even though I promised myself that I would never again write a fanfic since the last one failed epically but I don't know. I've been planning this one for awhile so I think it will actually work!
It's still going to be a couple of months before I get it down pat, but it's summer now, hopefully I'll have a lot more time to write!
I'm super excited to share this with you and I hope once the first chapter is up that you guys will be excited too!
*Hopefully will be posted by August 2nd!
