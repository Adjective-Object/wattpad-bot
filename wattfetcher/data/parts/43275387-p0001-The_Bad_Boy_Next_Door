I was walking to and from the car taking us stuff inside, when my sister actually started to talk to me. "Imogen will you take this inside for me. One: it's too heavy and Two: I have a call I need to take." Audrey said with a look of disapproval. I really didn't want to but knowing how she would react I just did it. Once everything was inside we started to unpack. I claimed the large-ish bedroom upstairs and put everything away. "Dad, I am going for a walk to look, around. Is that okay?" I shouted out. Again no answer so I just left. I went and the basic groceries for the house, so we could at least have dinner. We had spaghetti and meatballs for dinner and as always no one sat together. "Audrey, Imogen could come here please we need to talk." My Dad called out. "Just a sec!" Audrey yelled out. I trudged down the stairs. "Girls, I have a date tonight so I need you to be on your best behaviour. No boys over and no parties okay? Call me if you need anything." Dad said with what sounded like a tone of disapproval. "Sure Dad. Bye!" Audrey said happily. With Dad now gone Audrey turned to me and said, "Hey, I am going to that party tonight so you need to pretend that I never went when Dad gets home." She said. "Audrey, I am not covering for you again." I said. "This would be about the 100th time I've covered for you." She gave me a withering look. "Just do this for me will you? Thanks!" She cried.Once she left I sat down in my room and read my book.
