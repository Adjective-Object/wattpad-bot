Day after another Karam and Simon got really close,  almost like brothers. The feeling inside my chest started growing while my clothes were shrinking.
"I called the school and they said it is fine if you  stay here for 2 month but not more and you'll have to go to school on Fridays and Saturdays to catch up" Simon said, "What about you?" I asked him as he and Karam were playing on the Playstation 4, "Moy said I'm really sick and will be absent for another week, is it fine if I stay for another week?", "Yeah sure man, the house is yours", "What if i dont want him to stay?"I raised an eyebrow, "Too bad, because Karam does" I chuckled, another week, "Get up" I turned the Ps4 off, "NOOO" Karam and Simon shouted, "My friends are coming, get out" I said, "I was about so score" Simon said angrily, "Are they hot?" He grinned,  "Yes, now get out", "No, you might need help, right Karam?", "Totally right, Simon" We started fighting then the bell rang, "You better not ruin everything, I opened the door and all my old friend came in, we hugged each others, teared a little bit, "Hi" Simon said, My friends smiled at him and some of them winked, "Hey! Stop it" I said, "I'm Simon" then the girls started introducing themselves to him, "I'm Leena's friend" I wanted to slap him more than I wanted to slap my friends who almost drooled, "I'll explain later" I said, Karam said "Hi" then me and my friends walked to the 2nd floor, it had a huge living room with purple sofas. We laughed a lot and refreshed our memories and went back to the time we used to fight over a pencil, "YOU KNOW, I LOVE ARAB GIRLS, I WILL PROBABLY TAKE ONE" Simon said loud on purpose, the girls chuckled, "AND I LOVE AMERICAN GIRLS, I'LL PROBABLY KEEP YOU" I was sure that Simon and Karam heard me because I heard their laugh from down stairs.
"The girls were crazy about you" I chuckled, "I know " Karam said, "Not you, Simon" I exploaded in laughter, so did Simon, "What's the new news? Girls are always crazy about me" Simon said and Karam punched his shoulder "I was about to do this" I giggled,
10 pm ,I called Simon and he immediately picked up, "To our secret place" We said in sync and chuckled, I sneaked out my room and we left. "There's something I've kept hidden for so long and I can't take it anymore " I said, "What? Spit it out" Simon looked concerned, "You always chose something that's disgusting, I'm gonna chose what we're going to drink today" I said and he exploaded in laughter, "Fine fine, just turn the car on" He kept laughing.
We were talking and drinking milkshakes, I was staring at his perfect face, "Sory" He said as he dropped the cup and I became covered in milkshake, "Oh you did NOT" I opened my cup and threw it at him, we started a milkshake fight.
"Are you happy now? They kicked us out" Simon frowned, I laughed as we were walking in the streets of Amman, "It's all because of you tho".
"Then what?" I asked as me and Simon were lying under the tree in my garden, "I threw up on her dress" He said and I laughed loudly, "And that's why, I'm not allowed to eat Bananas till now" A tear rolled down my cheek because I was laughing too hard. We just lied down the tree, on the grass, watching the stars, alone, at night, I knew it was wrong, but I was happy, I knew that it won't go smoothly if Karam caught us, I knew it was wrong but it felt so right.
"I want to be a Pilot" Simon said, "To see the world?" I asked, "No, for the hot girls around the world" I chuckled, "Shut up" I turned my head toward him, "You know what?", "What?" He raised an eyebrow, "Don't raise your eyebrow, that's my move" We both chuckled, "Seriously, what?" He asked, "I think I'm in love" I sighed and he turned his face toward me and giggled, "Oh really?" He asked in disbelief, "Yes, with you" I looked back at the stars, his smile faded, "You're kidding, aren't you?" He asked worriedly, "No, I fell in love with you, I never wanted to", "No NO, you are not, you're just having mixed emotions because you lost you parents and you're facing a new life" He stood up,  "Don't you love me back?" I asked, "I adore you more than you think, but it's just wrong, you're weak now and trying to heal your wounds. I won't take advantage of you" He said worriedly, I stood up "I'm not a kid anymore, I know my feelings well" I sighed, "I don't want you to do something you'll regret in the future" He said, "I want to break free, live in the moment and dont think about tomorrow. You sneaked into my life and wrapped your hands around my heart" I grabbed his shirt, stood on my tiptoes, I had No control, I had a new feeling, I looked at him deep in the eyes, "Please think of what you're about to do" His breath hit my nose because of the short distance that was between us, "I don't want to think, I want to try and live" I closed my eyes, leaned closer and touched his lips with mine. Is that what love tastes like? Or is it what's left of the milkshake on his lips?
