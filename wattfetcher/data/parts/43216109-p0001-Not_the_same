I walk into my bathroom and stripped down my outfit to see scars filling the whole outer space of my body.How could I let this happen to me? Was I really that dumb enough to let him fool me into thinking he was some nice educational guy who cared about the law? The worst this is....his father's a cop,he'll never tell the truth and change the whole situation to something opposite. He's to scared his daddy will turn him in and get disappointed...but what about me? You feel guilty , your dad will feel disappointed, but what would I feel? Sure you all have your feeling right now and it's ok but time will pass on and you'll forget this ever happened...but how do I forget? How do I forget his cold strong hands rubbing against my body, him almost beating me to death. He told me that everything will be fine and that he'll take it easy on me when really he's using that as a cover up to get in my panties. I told him to stop...but you know...I wouldn't be here telling you my story if he stopped.
