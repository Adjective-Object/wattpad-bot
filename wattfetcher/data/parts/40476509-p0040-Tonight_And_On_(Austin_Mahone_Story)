He took my shirt off and didn't see any bruises or cuts from the accident but he did see bruises that were from recently. I was hoping that he wouldn't realize it.
Austin: Ok I see bruises but they aren't from the accident. They're fresh. Is there something that you didn't tell me?
I spoke too soon.
Me: Um........... No
Austin: You're hiding something from me, what is it? Tell me!
Me: No!
Austin: See I knew you were hiding something. So what is it?
Me: I'm not telling you!
Austin: Come on Baby, tell me! (All your secrets tonight) {Sorry I had too lol}
He started shouting at me begging for me to tell him and it was driving me insane. I couldn't take it anymore.
Me: I WAS RAPED!!!! THERE I SAID IT, HAPPY?!
He paused and looked at me as I started to cry.
