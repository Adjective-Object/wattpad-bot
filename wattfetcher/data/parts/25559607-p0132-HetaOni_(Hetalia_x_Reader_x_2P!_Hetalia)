The blonde German looked away, but spoke, "Ah, yes. Well

... it's probably for the same reason you didn't tell us that everyone else is dead."

I was taken aback by his words. "You knew??!"

Prussia gave a light chuckle upon listening to us. "Hahah!

... Well... now, West, why don't we take a little rest? I'm really tired."

Germany turned to his older brother and nodded. "You're right, Prussia. You can go ahead; I'll catch up with you."

"Why?! No! I can't do this any more! I'm staying with you!!" I exclaimed.

Germany finally looked at me straight in the eyes and spoke weakly, "Anyone who... disobeys... will run... ten laps"

Prussia slowly slumped his arms to his sides."...... Look... if you don't... hurry up...he'll keep adding even more."

I started shaking, not wanting to accept what was happening before my very eyes.
"Fine! I'll run!! I'll run ten laps! I'll run as many laps as you want! But I'll run away!

And then Germany...

... will have to run

... to catch me..."

Suddenly, I noticed Prussia limply hung his head down.

"Prussi---"

Before I could even try to call out to Prussia...I also saw Germany close his eyes slowly and give...his final breath.

"Ger...ma...ny..."

***LOST PRUSSIA AND GERMANY***

Even when I followed different paths, no matter what I did, they still left me.


If only I hadn't heard those rumours...


If only I hadn't told America.
