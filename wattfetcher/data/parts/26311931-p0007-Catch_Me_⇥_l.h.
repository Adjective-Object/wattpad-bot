"I thought you guys were solid," she mumbled, confused at why she would do that. Smith and Dawn had been together for four years, before Chloe had arrived in LA. They were inseparable, holding hands non-stop and constant make-out sessions, even when the blonde was in the room. "You upset?"
"I was practically bawling," he laughed, shaking his head at the ground. The two had stopped in front of her bedroom, Chloe worried about her other best friend for the past two years. She placed her small hand on his shoulder, the other wiping his face. "Until she told me why."
The girl looked at Smith like he had two heads. Her night had already been eventful enough, now Smith and Dawn had broken up, and he was okay with that. "What'd she say?"
"She told me she was into girls," was all he said, walking into her room, a small smile on his face. She jumped onto her bed, sending her flying to the floor. A loud groan came from the corner of her room, where she fell. Smith couldn't help, but laugh at the stupidity of his best friend. "You're an idiot."
"I love you, too," Chloe fake smiled, grabbing the cookie dough ice cream and sticking her tongue out. Yes, Chloe did keep plastic spoons in her room for some odd reason, so she grabbed one and began spooning the little bits of heaven into her mouth. Her peanut butter jar laying on the floor, along with the now dirty, silver spoon.
"Aren't you lactose intolerant?" The boy asked, chuckling at the blonde. She sat crossed legged on top of her comforter, shoveling ice cream to her face. There was already chocolate on her face, but Smith just let her be. Chloe responded with a nod, cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk. "So he dumped you, tonight."
"Yes, he did," she whispered, staring at the wall. The blonde was never good with expressing how she felt, nor did she ever like to. That's why she always ended up single, she never let anyone in since Luke. They always cheated on her. "Found him in a bathroom with a bottle blonde."
"You're a bottle blonde," Smith laughed, taking a seat next to her. Chloe laid her head on his shoulder, not crying. She was used to the heartache and the cheating and the lies. It was nothing new, which made her even sadder.
"I hate you."
"How'd the paps find out so fast?" He asked. It didn't make sense for them to know already, or at all. Nothing really made sense because Jake was incredibly into Chloe. Before they were even a thing, he was so in love with her already, but she couldn't tell. Smith had to manually put the two together.
"I have no clue, love," Chloe sighed, pointing at the opened door, silently asking for the boy to close it.
"So we both left loved and came back alone," he breathed, obeying Chloe's orders. The door shut quietly as he turned off the light. The only thing on was the TV, Big Bang Theory playing in the background.
"I guess so," she said, handing Smith a spoon. The two just sat there in the dark, filling their faces to block out the pain, and watched Sheldon repeatedly knock on Penny's door.
"You're my best friend," he smiled, opening up the strawberry tub. "You know that, right?"
"God, you're cheesy," she laughed, nudging his shoulder. Chloe liked being alone with Smith. She didn't have to wear this giant mask or change her obnoxious laugh. She got to be herself around him, no matter how clich√© that sounded.
"Fuck you."
