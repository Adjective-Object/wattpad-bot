"You can come if you want" I said to Seth.
'Uhm I'll stay here" He said back. I closed the door and walked over to my dads plaque. I sat down and looked at his name engraved in the plaque. I took a deep breath holding in the tears.
"Hey dad." I began. "Miss you being around the house. I know I havent been here in a while. I didn't forget about you don't worry." I could feel the tears building up again. "Mom has a boyfriend. It didn't take her long to move on. I'm so pissed off at her. How could she do this to you? To me?" A tear fell from my eye. "I really miss you dad. I know your still around watching over me. I'm trying really hard to make you and mom proud of me." Another tear escaped and I let it fall down my cheek. "Don't worry dad I still don't have a boyfriend. I know how much that agrivated you. Your excuse was I was to young and didn't know anything. You where right, and I would tell you that after ever brake up I had. You would never tell me that though. I knew how much you wanted to" I said with a smile another tear falling from my eye. "My grades are alright. B's. I could do better, but since you left I haven't really been myself. You where my bestfriend dad. Sometimes I don't know what to do. The pain gets so bad sometimes. I don't know how to deal with it." I let out a sob. "I'm trying dad. I really am" I held my head in my hands sobbing brutally. I must look like an idiot. I really don't care right now though. "I love you dad. I always will. I'll see you soon" I blew a kiss at the plaque and then got up. I whiped away my tears and started walking back to the car. I bumped into a hard chest and gasped. I looked up seeing Seth. His eyes where teary like he wanted to cry.
"How much did you hear?" I asked him.
"All of it" He choked out.
"Well if your standing there to give me pitty don't. You will never see something like that again. Never speek of this with anyone! Lets go" I said harshly, I pushed past him and to my car. I got in and waited for him to get in.
"Pity can be good sometimes" He suddenly said, braking the silence.
"Well I don't want it. I don't need people feeling bad for me because my father died. I have heard it all before. 'oh Shea I am so sorry about your dad he was a great man' 'oh shea I am so sorry are you okay' 'Hes in a better place sweetheart. so sorry for your loss' Please tell me something I don't know. Reminding me won't make it better. I can deal with it myself" I spat at him.
"Well thats not what you said"
"SHUT UP! You weren't supposed to hear that! Why the frik did you follow me anyways? You said you where going to stay in the car" I said back.
"I realized my Grandmother was a little up ways and I was going to visit her. I heared you talking and decided to listen. Happy I did"
"Why? Cause you saw me cry?"
"I don't know why you think I'm such a bad guy Shea" He said shaking his head.
"You call a player, a bully, an egotistic jurk a good guy?" I asked stunned
"Okay maybe i'm not the nicest guy but I never did anything to you!"
"But you did! Just shut up! I don't want to talk to anyone. I should have came alone!" I said angry.
"Whatever bitch" He spat
"See there is the asshole everyone knows! The nice guy didn't last very long! It was probably just an act. Sorry buddy it didn't work!" I said louder that I wanted ot to sound.
"Oh just shut up cry baby" He spat
