I didn't think I was a mermaid, but that was until I met Angela Naomh. Angela had told me all about me being a mermaid, because she was my birth mom. She and my father had given me up to keep my safe. Why couldn't they keep me safe themselves?
One time in Walmart, I had a little girl come up to me and say "Are you a mermaid?" And I looked at that little girl and I said "No, I don't think so." in the most polite voice I could, only to find out 3 months later that I actually am one. That little girl knew, just by looking at me, what I actually was and I didn't know after 15 years of being me.
