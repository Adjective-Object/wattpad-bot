I smiled, "Sweety, I am telling you the truth."
She cried out, "Look at your arms! You can't tell me that you like doing this to yourself!!"
Chuckling I say, "My sweet little dove. It doesn't hurt, I promise. But I'm not gonna let a broken heart kill me. This here razor's gonna be my end."
She sobbed, "But why? I mean I hurt too, but why are you doing this?"
I grabbed my ex girlfriend's hand and kissed each finger tip. When I finished, I just simply said, "Oh honey."
A/N- Amd this is how I ended my last relationship....
