America stepped forward and gave me a thumbs up. "That's right, dudette! The HERO is here for you!" he said, then gestured at the other countries and continued, "...the hero and all of my support! HAHAHA!"
"Thanks. I'm happy you guys are here." I said, smiling.
Russia stared blankly and spoke, "Ah...before I forget...I have to ask something," the tall Russian man turned to a certain Northern Italian. "...Italy...have you met up with these...'Second Players' before, like in a timeloop or something...?"
"Ve...I'm sorry...but no matter how hard I try...I just can't seem to recall anything about meeting them in this mansion... All I remember would be the timeloops...with the ten of us...along with our current timeloop which has...thirteen..." Italy answered.
Germany tilted his head. "Hmm. Maybe you really haven't encountered them in the mansion before...or maybe you must have forgotten about it? It's alright, we don't expect you to piece every memory together just like that. Take your time."
"Forgotten...maybe? Mhhmm... I'll do my best in recalling. Thanks, Germany." the Northern Italian said, giving a small smile.
Japan turned to the two and spoke, "Well, it's very comforting to see that we are all patching things up. I feel like we've all formed a very special bond of some sort."
"...'We'...? You mean...uhm...I'm...I'm included...?" I asked shyly.
England turned to me and smiled. "Of course, love. We've been through a lot, and ever since we met you...you've played an important part alongside us. You belong, you're included...don't make anything else make you think otherwise." he told me. The rest of the countries gave approving nods and smiled, as well.
"...Thanks.....I....I love you guys...hahaha..." I said softly, my lips trembling a bit. Even after everything, I still belong...with them... I feel my whole being fill with warmth. It's surreal, feeling belongingness with...Hetalia characters. I sigh happily.
Italy ran his fingers through his hair. "Ve~ An atmosphere like this feels so nice. I wish times like these would last forever.... I wonder if I'll forget again? I don't want that... I don't want to forget our newly found bond."
"Italy..." Germany gave a concerned look.
Spain nodded. "Yeah. Isn't there anything we can do here?"
After a long pause, America snapped his fingers and stood up. "......Oh! I know!"
"Wh-what? What are you talking about?" Canada asked, confused.
America grinned and spoke excitedly, "Let's form an alliance! A testimony of our new bond, without any relation to the Allies or the Axis or even the neutral nations, but to all of us who are here!"
"Ooh, sounds interesting. I approve." Prussia said, nodding.
Japan looks over to the others. "I am of the same opinion as America. Let's do it. Did we form an alliance before?"
Romano shook his head. "No, not as far as I know... I approve, too."
"....Uhm, wait..." I said, raising my hand.
America turned to me. "Hmm? What is it, dudette? You don't want to?"
"Well, it's not that I don't want to...It's just that...I'm not a country, remember?" I frowned, crossing my arms.
China raised his overly long sleeves. "Aiyah. We almost forgot about that fact, aru..."
