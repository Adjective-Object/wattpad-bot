As Cam and I headed downstairs all the boys were there so was Sammy Cameron held my hand and lead me to the couch he made me sit in his lap and it wasnt comfortable.
We were watching Cams movie Expelled he was a good actor it was pretty funny when it came to him and lia's kissing part everyone said "oooo" i giggled at all of them.
I got off Cameron lap and went to get water and some food Sammy was in the kitchen we made some eye contact but nothing else. I went back and sat next to Cam this time i fed him some of my chips.
Everyone kept staring at us i felt ackward i told Cam that i was going to the room.He said it was ok.When i went to the room i started crying i missed my family.Then i heard "Hey Isabelle are you ok?Are u crying?Its Sammy" he said "No im not crying please just leave before Cam sees ur talking to me."i said in a cracky voice."Ill tell him ok" he said "Ok" i said back.
A few moments later Cam came in the room he looked at me sadly but pissed.
"Whats wrong?Why were u talking to him?" Cam said "First i wasnt talking to him he talked to me and i miss m-my fam-family" i said balling out.He looked at me with pity in his eyes he told me tmmrow well go see them and i hope i do....
