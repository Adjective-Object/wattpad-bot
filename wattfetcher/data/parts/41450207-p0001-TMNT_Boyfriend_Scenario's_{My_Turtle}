(Before I started writing I came up with only a few scenarios 200 to be exact hehe)



Leonardo

You were walking home from school late at night, why? well you had to work on a project and home wasn't a quiet working space, as you were walking home you walked by and alley way and you were pulled into the alley and pinned to the wall by a purple dragon.

"Give me your Money" He commanded

"Don't got any" you sneered

"then your body will do just fine~" He said seductively

You struggled against his grip.

"No! Let me go! You-" You yelled but was interrupted

"Halt Villain! Let the girl go!" A voice yelled

'Halt villain?' You thought

Then the guy who was pinning you to the wall was pulled off of you and thrown to the wall knocking him unconscious, good job wall!, You looked around for your savior but nothing.

"Hello?" you called out

"yes?" The same voice that spoke before replied

"can I see you?" You asked

"no you'll get scared and run" He stated

"why would I run when you just saved me?" You questioned

"good point" he replied

He then came out of the shadows and you saw a turtle, yes a TURTLE!, He had a Blue mask on and amazing Blue eyes and twin katanas strapped to his shell, You stared at him in amazement.

"wow" You spoke

"Wow!? really wow!? I don't scare you!?" he spoke shocked

"Nope, you're actually kinda cute" you stated

He blushed slightly

"I'm Leonardo but call me Leo" Leo spoke

"Nice to meet you Leo, I'm Y/n" You replied

"well I should go and find my brothers, see you later Y/n" He spoke

"Wait! can-"

You started but he was already gone
