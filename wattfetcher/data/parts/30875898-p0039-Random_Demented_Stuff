When the yelling gets even louder
And it's drowned out only by the sound of my tears
When I see their mouths grow even wider
And they devour all of my fears
When the unspoken words can't get any softer
And I can't hear it so I'm sure they're not even talking
That's when I hear the yelling again
When I hear the voices begin
