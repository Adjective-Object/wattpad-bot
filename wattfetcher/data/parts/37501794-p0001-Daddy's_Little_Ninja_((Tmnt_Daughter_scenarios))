Leonardo
Leo was out on patrol, when he saw some purple dragons surrounding a woman in an alleyway.
He sprang into action, but they snatched something out of her hands and Fong stabbed her in the stomach, before he could stop him.
"That's for not paying up." Fong said smiling cruelly.
Leo attacked the remaining purple dragons, causing them to flee and he rushed over to the woman's side.
"(Y/n)... please keep my (y/n) safe..." She croaked pointing to a small bundle laying on the ground by a dumpster.
Leo quickly stood and walked over to you, picking you up gently from the pile of trash you were laying on.
"Don't let... Fong take her... please." your mother pleaded in between ragged breaths.
"I promise." Leo said kneeling down beside her once again.
"Thank you..." she smiled weakly up at you and Leo and took her final breath.
Leo closed his eyes and hugged you closer to his shell. "I promise I'll protect you (y/n)."

Raphael
Raph was walking back to the lair from hanging with Casey, when he heard a loud crash and crying.
He went to investigate and came to an old apartment building with a broken window, and a man and a woman screaming at each other inside.
"Shut up or your stupid bastard gets it!!" the man shouted picking you up by your ankle and holding you out the window, while you screamed and cried.
"Go for it!! See if I care if it's gone!! One less little monster around!"
Raph couldn't believe what was happening and to his horror watched the man let go of you.
He dived off you building after you and caught you before you could hit the ground.
"I got you! Don't worry Raph's got you." he cooed trying to get you to stop screaming.
You finally cried yourself to sleep in his arms as he rocked you back and forth gently.
"That's better." he sighed standing up.
He glared up at the broken window and started carrying you back to the lair.
"I think I'll call you (y/n)... yeah that's perfect for a princess like you." He said hugging you tighter to his shell. "Don't tell the guys I said that."

Donatello
Donnie was out with April looking for mutagen when he heard you screaming from the rooftops.
He quickly scaled the wall and found you being carried away by the Kraang. You screamed and thrashed in the Kraang's arms as Donnie and April started fighting them off.
You felt the weight of the cold metal arms leave and you went sailing through the air.
"I got her! I got her!!" Donnie shouted running with his arms stretched out ready to catch you.
He leapt forward and snatched you out of the air, landing on the back of his shell.
"Nice catch Don!!" April cheered kicking the last Kraang off the edge of the building into a dumpster below.
