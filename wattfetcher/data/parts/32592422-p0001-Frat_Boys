Alexa's pov
I took a seat in the back of the class.Its my junior year of college and today is the first day . No I'm not nervouse at all I just want to see if I know  anyone.I like to be early so I was the first one to class and it felt good .I sat in the last row dead center .As people started to arrive I was looking to see if I knew anyone and I saw my roommate Becca .I just met her today but she is so nice and I feel like we will be good friends.
"Hey,what's up "becca said
"Nothing much ,how about you "
"Just freaking out "
"Why "
"Because there are so many hot guys and I just got invited to a party with one of them tomorrow "Becca said in excitement .
"Awsome ,how hot is he on a scale of one to ten"
"LIKE A TEN OH MY GOD HERE GE COMES LOOK"
As she told me to look she pointed her finger to the door and I saw him .I'm not going to lie he's hot .And his name is Ashton .A girl and a boy Walked  in behind him and she had long black hair and she was kissing a guy with brown hair and brown eyes . I guess their a couple .The girl that was making out with her boyfriend sat next to me and introduced her self .Her name is Alexzandria but I can call her Alex . I over heard her and her boyfriend talking about a party .Oh now it makes sense Becca is going to a house party with Ashton and so is Alex and Liam ,but who's party is it .
"Hey ,babe"I looked to my right to see a boy with green eyes and brown curly hair .Babe did he seriously just call me babe I don't even know him ."Babe?,who are you calling babe"
"You of course "the green eyed man said .
"Ok well listen we just met so don't call me your babe "!
"Mmmm feisty "
"Shut up "
"Ok listen I'll make it up to you ,want to come to a party with me tonight ?"
"Never in your wildest dreams."
