Erin's POV
I can't not cry? Jordan clutched my hand as tight as he could without hurting me. "Don't you ever... ever leave my side." He said.
"Please." I said.
"Please what?" He asked.
"Please, please don't." I said as I got teary eyed.
"What?" He asked in a comforting voice.
"I love you." I said before I kissed his cheek.
"I love you." He responded.
Jordan was starting to get teary eyed too.
"Is this seriously going to happen again?" I asked.
"Does it matter?" He asked.
"No, no it doesn't." I responded.
"Before -- umm, before we flood the place..." he started.
"Yeah?" I asked.
"I want you to -- umm..." he started again.
"Just say it already." I said.
"I want you to know that everything you have said to me since we've been together... has made me love you more than I thought it was possible to love someone. I love you... so so much, so much that I... sometimes don't know what to do with myself. I get so mad and happy and super conflicted over it... that... I broke a pencil once." He said.
"You broke a pencil over me?" I asked.
"Yeah." He sighed. I kissed him and hugged him and his conflicted self.
"I do the same thing." I sniffled.
"Did you almost break a lamp though?" He asked.
"A lamp too, Jordan? Control yourself." I said.
"I can't." He said as he started to cry first this time.
"How'd this happen? You're crying first." I asked.
"Baby!?" He said as his eyes filled with tears.
"I love you, Jordan." I said.
"I love you... way too much." He said.
"How much is too much?"
"To the point where you break pencils, Erin." He said after pulling away from the hug.
"Ha, Jordan." I said.
"I also threw a pillow from my couch in the office, I threw that and one of my monitors almost fell. I can lose money and brake things because I love you that much." He said.
"Jesus, Jordan." I said
