I completed my day normally until ...
"Hi" Miley stood in front of me, I was wondering weather I should prepare some harsh words to say to her or slap her before she gets to say another word, but  ... "Forgiveness" ... Islam says :  Forgive others.
"Yes?"I forced a smile to cross my face, "I was wondering if I could have something to read about Islam" Even if she had hidden intentions I couldn't say no, I gave her what she wanted silently, "Can't you see that I'm trying to be nice ? Talk to me !" She was annoyed by my silence, "No, I can't" I walked away from her, "Wait !" She caught my arm, "What?" I raised an eyebrow, "I-I'm sorry, can we start all over again?" She said, "Cut it off because I don't have time for your games" I headed to my locker and she followed me, "No, I'm serious" I slammed my locker forcefully and headed to my English class, "Can I talk to you for a second" My belly ached at his voice, his warm thick voice, his scent, his dimple that I hadn't seen for so long and his charming eyes, "I'm busy now" I put my hand over my hidden baby, his eyes stared at my belly, "Leena please, stop it" He cupped my face with his hands but I slapped both of them off, "Leena, don't do this to me, I can't play this game anymore, you know you can't hate me and you know I still feel something toward you, you can't overlook the fact that there's something that connects us together. Babe, I need you" I stared at him for seconds, "But I DON'T" I almost screamed, "Is there a problem Leena?" My english teacher came amd saved me, "No sir" Simon said as he was glaring at me, "Good. I need to talk to you Leena" I nodded and followed him, "I was wondering if you have some more books, I found the things you gave me the other day pretty interesting. Plus, I heard what you said when you were standing on the table. I'm proud that you defended yourself, not many people are capable of doing that, you are an example of the perfect humam being, you appreciate your mistakes and learn from them" He said, "Thank you mister, of course I do, I'll give them to you after class" I smiled and we headed together to the class.
I was eating with Molly and my other friends then Simon came "Get up, we need to talk" He said and I ignored him, "Go away, what you've done is more than enough" Molly said, "Stay out, now get up Leena we need to talk" He pulled my wrist, Tom was eating with his friends then noticed us and came, "What's going on man" Tom tapped Simon's shoulder, "I still love her" Simon said loud enought for everybody around us to hear and they gasped, "Cool, now everybody knows" I sighed, I heard girls whispering and saying "I told you so" to each others, "Come on!" Simon pulled my wrist again, "Don't touch her" Tom pushed Simon, "Woah ! Now you wrapped your hands around Tom?" Everybody was watching something similar to a movie, the only thing missing was popcorn, "Listen Simon, don't forget that I got a black belt in Karate and I'm doing my best to stop myself from showing you my skills" I warned him.
