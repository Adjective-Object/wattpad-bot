"No date days."
"What?"
"We're going to go on dates during the day like this. I mean it's the only time we're really able to and it's different and cute and I like it."
"Oh that's good."
"Good."
Soon our waitress came and took our drink orders before walking off again.
"You're having fun on tour right?" I asked him.
"Yeah its really great being with all these bands and working for you guys. I get to tour with my boyfriend and it's just fucking amazing."
"Well I'm just glad you're having fun I mean it can get really fucking boring sometimes."
"Yeah but I'm always busying myself."
"Or spending time with you amazing boyfriend who just so happens to be the lead singer of the band that you fangirl over."
"Yeah I guess that's cool too."
"It's your favorite thing to do." I said, "I remember when I first met you. You were so adorable and awkward."
"Don't talk about it." He said blushing.
"Why not? You were so adorable and cute and just this awkward little shit."
"Stop it."
"Nope, it was great. I love it when you're awkward. I loved when I was walking out you were like: Oh my god Vic Fuentes just shook my hand! It was so cute."
"Vic! Stop embarrassing me!"
"I just like seeing you blush like that." I said smiling at his bright red face.
"Its not cool!" He said burying his face in his hands.
"It's absolutely adorable and cute."
"No its not."
"Why not?"
"Because I look like a fucking tomato now."
"And it's so cute!" I cooed.
"No."
"Yes."
"No." He muttered as the waitress came back and gave us our drinks before taking our orders and leaving again.
"You are the cutest thing ever so deal with it because I'm always going to try and make you blush."
"I don't like you." He said glaring at me.
"What happened to you being my biggest fan?"
"Well now I'm Tony's biggest fan."
"Tony doesn't deserve you." I told him, "Now admit it, I'm your favorite."
"Nope its Tony. Ya know I think I'll call him and tell him."
"If you do I'm not taking you to the other two parts of our date."
"Fine, fine but only because I want to see part two."
"That's what I thought."
"Whatever."
"Don't whatever me."
"Too late for that." He mumbled rolling his eyes at me.
"You know what Mr. Bostwick if you don't stop being mean to me I'm not taking you to part two."
"Okay, okay I'll stop being mean."
