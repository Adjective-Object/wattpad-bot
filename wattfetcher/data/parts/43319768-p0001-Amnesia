I slowly open my eyes with my head throbbing. Ok, so my name is..um...um... Nikki Jones and I am..um let me think here...seventeen years old.I look around and realized that this is not my bedroom, plus why are there wires connected to me, it looks creepy.Wait just a minute, I'm in a strange place so that means I must have been kidnapped. I've been KIDNAPPED! What do I do, scream? No because if I do that then the kidnappers will know I'm awake.
Crap crap crap, that is the only thing going through my head when I see that door knob start to turn. The door is now completely opened and the kidnappers walk in. Well that's what I thought anyway.
I yell "Get away kidnappers!"
"What, you're in a hospital, no one kidnapped you Nikki." replied one talk blonde guy.
A girl around my height ran up and hugged me then said "OMG are you hurt, what happened?"
I then quickly screamed "Get away stranger, I have never even seen you before!"
Then all of them asked "You don't remember us?"
I answer "No. Why, should I know you weird people?"
One of them did look familiar but I don't know why. So after staring at her for about ten minutes I motioned her to come closer.
"Do I know you?" I whisper into her ear.
She whispered back "Yes, I'm your older sister Lucy."
She told me that she was two years older, so that means she is nineteen years old.
The stranger who apparently works here asked them nicely to leave.
Hospital worker asks "So do you remember anything other then your name and age?"
I replied "No and I'm not supposed to be talking to strangers."
She told me that I have amnesia. She then just hands my a weird looking piece of paper that is folded before leaving. It had something written in it. It said try and remember who you are. Remember your past and who you are Nikki Jones.
