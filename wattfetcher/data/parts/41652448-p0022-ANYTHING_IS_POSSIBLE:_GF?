Mackenzie: we should get going to bed.
The other nodded in agreement.
Pacifica: yeah. We went to our bed. In a few minutes Pacifica and Mabel were fast asleep, Zoe and I were still up.
Zoe: something wrong Mack?
Mackenzie: what if, we can't get The twins And Pacifica back home?
Zoe: Mack?
I ignored her.
Mackenzie: what if, they never get back home, and they never get to go back to their old life?
Zoe: Mack?!
Zoe said in a whisper yell. This time I looked at her.
Zoe: we will get them back home. I promise. They will get their lives back. I promise.
Zoe repeated. I nodded my head.
Zoe.d now let's gets some sleep.
I nodded my head agin in agreement. My eyes started to close, in my head I'm telling myself "they will get back home"
