*3 months later*Mallory:It's been 3 months and River and I are still going strong. My birthday is in 2 weeks and I'm so excited. River's planning something special and he won't tell me what it's going to be.
I was having a date with River at the rollerskating rink. He tied my skates up and then his. We skated over to the rink and went around and around. I laughed when he was skating backwards and fell.
I helped him up and we went to the cafe to get something to eat. We sat in a booth and took our order: 1 strawberry milkshake, 1 Pepsi-Cola, and 2 hamburgers. We talked and talked about random things that only made sense to us.
When the food came, I got my Pepsi-Cola and burger while River got his order. We ate and talked still until our food was gone in minutes. "So, do you like this?" River asked me.
"What do you mean?" I asked confused.
"I mean, do you like...dating me?"
"Of course I do." I smiled. River smiled back as we paid, walking out. He walked me back to my house and we exchanged our goodbyes. He kissed me and walked back to his house as I walked into mine. "Hey Mallory, how was your date?" Corey asked me.
"It was...amazing." I replied and he laughed quietly. I went up to my room and fell onto my bed, hugging my pillow as I thought about him...River...River Jude Bottom Phoenix.
