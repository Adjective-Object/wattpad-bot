First year in High School and I learn that we have a bullying awareness day, and that day just happens to be called A Day Of Silence, where you take a vow to remain silent for the entire day for those who are silent every day.
I hate this day. Know why? Of course you don't.
It's because this day doesn't do shit. Not for me, and not for any other bully victims. I didn't do it cause I knew it wasn't going to help. Because, *drum-roll*, I get made fun of every day, regardless. And especially yesterday. It was BULLYING AWARENESS DAY for crying out loud, and the torment was pretty bad nonetheless.
Seriously, what the hell? What the hell do you want from me? Leave me the hell alone, for the love of Azphel. Just go away and go lead your happy, bitchy, preppy little lives. Cause I don't want you in mine.
Yesterday was also the day that I learned that someone who I THOUGHT was my friend actually isn't. Which made my day that much worse.
Bullies need to go walk a mile in my shoes. Or just get hung by their toes. I'd actually rather the second version. Makes their demise that much more enjoyable.
Seriously, people. When is it going to stop? The Day Of Silence didn't do shit. If anything, it made everything that much worse.
In fact, I'm thinking of going mute by choice. Just not talking anymore, to anyone. That's how bad it's gotten, and that's how bad I feel.
