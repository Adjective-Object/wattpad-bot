ARIANA'S POV
I opened the door with my free hand and walked inside, I used my foot to close the door and then I walked over to the crib and layed Riley down in it. I took off my pumps and walked back over to the door, I was about to walk out of the room but someone grabbed my arm and pushed me against the door.
Ariana - Ross?
Ross - Where the hell were you?
Ariana - What?
Ross - Where were you?!
Ariana - I was at the mall!
Ross - Doing what?
Ariana - Buying stuff
Ross - What'd you buy?
Ariana - Stuff for Riley
Ross - Even if you did  go to the mall, why is it that you came back so late?
Ariana - I was swarmed by fans and the paparazzi, plus,Riley kept on crying because of the noise
