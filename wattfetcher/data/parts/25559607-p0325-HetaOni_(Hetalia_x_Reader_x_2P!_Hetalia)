After Part 2 (but a quicker version) of my bath, I exited the bathroom. The guys were kind of scattered about now. Adjusting my hoodie, I made my way back to the bed to get my phone. It was probably Luciano who texted me. Hey, he was the one who taking so long to reply.


Picking up my phone, I looked at the screen.

We all agreed that maybe it was possible for us to call a temporary truce with the First Players. We could even...talk, just like how you suggested. Reply back their answer as soon as they've decided among themselves whether to accept our offer or not.

I froze. What's up with them? This is...probably a trap? Or is it? Maybe?



What if they really did want to call a truce. Even if it was temporary, it's still a truce...it could end up into getting along completely, right??



It's a gamble, but I want to do it.

"Uhmm....I...I need to tell you guys something..." I said loud enough for all of them to hear me.
