The week went quicker then normal. I mostly stayed at my new home by myself since they were all at college anyway.
Harry has grown distant again like his usual self. All the disrespectful remarks and glares came back to life. I was just another shitty brick on the wall of people to hate. Sometimes I swear he's bipolar.
The rest of the four boys, though, were being so sweet and gave me comfort. Everyday I grow closer to them. They all invited me to a fraternity party, which I did accept. I've never been to an actual college party, only cheesy high school ones. So I am, sort of, excited.
I met Louis's girlfriend this week. Her name is Eleanor, who is the sweetest thing. We've been talking a lot there couple of days and she agreed to help me get ready for the party tonight. Well, she volunteered herself.
I told Eleanor everything that happened between Harry and I currently. She wasn't at all surprised about his rudeness. Apparently, he's like that to almost everyone. Though, she was confused that he was nice to me at certain times.
Eleanor made everyone leave the apartment and head to the frat house awhile so she can "fix me up".
"You ready to become more gorgeous than you already are?" She smiled at me.
"I think I am," I slightly grinned still not sure about the outcome of operation beautiful.
"I'll take that as a yes," she smirked and pulled me into Louis's bedroom. There was three dresses lying on his bed. Each of them were very revealing, but pretty.
"Choose," she pointed to the three pieces of sewn fabric lying side by side. I picked up a plain, black peplum dress. It was super short, but super cute. I quickly put it on and started walking to the mirror until Eleanor stopped me, blocking my reflection.
"No, not yet," she laughed and dragged me out of the room and into the bathroom. She made sure that my back was toward the mirror.
Eleanor applied, what seemed to be, pounds of makeup. Everything you could imagine, she put on my face. Then, she curled my hair. I almost got a peak until I was back out of the bathroom and into Louis's again. I stepped in some black wedges.
"Oh my god," she cheered, "Now look!"
I squinted my eyes afraid of what I was about to see. What I saw, shocked me. It didn't even look like me. There was actually little makeup then I thought and the dress wasn't that short. She was right, I do look prettier.
"Eleanor.." I trailed off, "Thank you so much. I look amazing."
"No problem," she laughed and we hugged each other before heading to the party.

The aroma of alcohol and smoke filled my lungs. It wasn't a pleasant scent either, but I could deal with it for a few hours. Eleanor and I walked further into the fraternity. We spotted all the guys, except Harry, of course.
"Lennon," Zayn walked up to me with widened eyes, "I haven't seen you like this before."
"Is that a compliment or.." I slightly laughed.
"Well, I mean, you always look beautiful, but tonight you're just plain sexy," his eyes scanned my body.
"Thanks," I blushed. The rest of them filled me up with flattering remarks.
I found myself glancing around, looking for Harry a few times. Something about his crude comments made me want to be around him more, just to hear his voice.
Oh, someone has a crush. My annoying conscience added whom I pushed out of my mind.
