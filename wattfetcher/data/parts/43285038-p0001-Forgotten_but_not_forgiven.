(A/N sorry but before we begin I want to say that I am sharing this account with my younger sister she wants to be called Whisper and she wants me to be called Meow... I know it's weird but I don't mind I just want to write this story and if any of you go and tease her because of her liking my little pony you will be banned. Also there will be NO spoilers so I expect the SAME in the comments! And that's all I want to say :)
The cleaning in between the territorys of BirdClan and Rock clan was once filled with the sound of battling cats, now all was quiet apart from the few victory yowls of a few BirdClan cats that could still stand. Both of the two battling clans  toke a great hit and dead body's of cats lay motionless on the blood stained ground. Including a black she cat with tips on her ears and front paws that where now dirty and red. That cat was the leader of RockClan, her name was Shootingstar.
A dark grey tom cat stood up shakily beside her. He had a torn ear and a deep gash in his front leg. He turned his mad Amber eyes to the fallen leader that his own noble leader had overpowered.
"The sooner her nine lives are over the better!" He spat out. Already  knowing that his leader would not allow him to finish off the rest of her lives, even after all she has done.
"Greystone, you know as well as I do that we do not kill in cold blood, if we where to take her life away over and over again we would be just as cruel as she was" replied a cat whose bright white coat stood out against the darkening world. Greystone nodded and glaced at his fallen clan mates and a flicker of sadness waved in his maded eyes for a mintue before he shook his head.
"We should get back to camp, Brightstar, they might come back still"
Brightstar nodded his white head and called his remaining clan together to drag the fallen back to camp. Even if they did manage to dive off RockClan, Brightstar and Greystone knew they would be back for vengeance over their leaders lost life but it would take them a while to recover and Brightstar worried if his own clan would be ready. In just a day half his clan was gone, include his trusted deputy, how would his clan manage with all the loss's how would HE manage without his friend beside him? StarClan knows...

(A/N chapter one will be much longer than this :) I hope you enjoyed!)
