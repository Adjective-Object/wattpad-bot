They are great at using defense mechanisms, passive aggressiveness, manipulation, and downright vindictive behaviors to get what they want. However, they can be so subtle in these approaches that it can leave a person oblivious to what's being done. It's no secret Scorpio's will always guard themselves first and foremost, so whatever method they see fit to protect themselves will suffice.
