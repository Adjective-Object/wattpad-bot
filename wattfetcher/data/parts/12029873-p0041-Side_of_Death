She was laughing with Skylar at her table and I tapped her shoulder.
"What is it?" she asked.
"I was just curious, why is there a stove in the washroom?"
"Well," Dawn started, "We can't always bathe in cold water, now can we? When it gets colder, we like to warm buckets of water over the stove. Everyone gets to bathe twice a week. Rewards here go like this; if they do something good, I let them have another bath day."
"That's great. I got it now, thanks," I replied, and walked off as she returned to her discussion with Skylar.
I went to join Sterling in the girls' room but someone tapped me from behind. I whirled around.
Jenn. Oh god.
"Do you have a minute?" she asked.
"Um," I stuttered, "Y- yeah. What is it?"
"You see," she started, "Finn's just been out of it lately. I think he's realized that I lied. That day in the building when you saved him, I told him that was me. I hope you don't mind, but as a girlfriend, it's a little embarrassing to say that it was someone else."
I nodded for her to go on.
"Anyways, if he asks you anything about it, will you just confirm it was me?"
I tried to process this. So I had to lie to Finn so that their relationship would be stronger?
"I will, don't worry," I smiled.
