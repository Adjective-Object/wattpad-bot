Hi. My name is Jett. Um, and. Im at home. I'm not sure what I'm doing. Just listing to five nights at freddys song. Well, my mom and dad.. Well, they said that we might move."Honey come on! Time for school!" My mom Diana said."Ugh." I said getting up. I picked up my backpack. I saw my friends at my bus stop. We all got on the bus and left.We got to our first period. Math.. Groan."Okay.. Can anyone tell me what 25,000 divided by 12 plus 23 plus x equals..." My teacher said.I raised my hand."Anyone?" Said the teacher. I waved my hand. "Anyone?" She said. I frowned. Does she see me waving my hand like I need to go the bathroom?"*sighs* Jett Azimuth." She said."X EQUALS 14 AND THE ANSWER IS 2106.33,33,333,333!" I said,"Correct! Impressive!" My teacher said.
