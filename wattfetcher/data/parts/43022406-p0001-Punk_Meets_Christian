Hey I'm Desiree Thomahs *I know I have a wierd last name* and you're in my head. I know that sounds like I'm crazy but, I have a mental diary, and when I go home I write *well type* all of the things that happen during the school year. Today was the first day of junior year, and I turn 18 in a few days, four to be exact. I have a late birthday and had to start school a year later than everyone else. I'm not your typical Christian girl, I'm allowed to do what I want (as long as it's safe) I'm allowed to say what ever I want (as long it wasn't disrespectful to my mom and jamamaw) and I'm allowed to wear what I want (as long as it wasn't too slutty).
