hello my Halo's I am back. I didn't update yesterday 'cause you guys are probably not enjoying the book anymore so I get if you are going to delete it.  but anyways, don't you get that moment when your parents are like; OMG this is my song! and it's a song from the 80's and your like, really, this sing is really weird..... then you think 'wait, is this what my kid(s) will think about my fav song? crap!!! what is your favourite  song? my fav rock song is Car Crash by Three Days Grace, my fav pop song is It Was Always You by Maroon 5, and my fav country song (yes I like country) is Dirt  Florida Georgia Line (LISN2DABEAT remix) dunz blame meh I like bassy songs. I haven't got all the q's required for my Q&A but this is Angel and I will see you halo's later byee:)
