dearest noel,
do you remember that day on the bus? do you remember the ginger haired girl? i do.
i remember clearly that day on the bus. me and you noel. we were just seven and we met this girl.

you: why is she pulling down her sleeves?
me: i don't know. i think she's cold.
you: no wait. i think i saw something really red on her wrist.
me: are you sure?
you: yes. i'm going to say hi.
me: are you serious?
you: yes. come on. she seems friendly and lonely.
me: okay.
you: hello. i'm noel.
girl: hi.
me: what hurt your hand? your wrist?
girl: oh that, it was just my silly cat. i swear it really hates me.
noel: haha me too. my cat tubby never likes playing with me.
it's funny to think that there was no cat . the cat never didn't not like her. because they weren't from the cat.
and the scariest part is...
to think that i am now that girl.
the same girl me and you met when we were just seven.
i'm the girl now who lies and says it's just my cat.
that i'm just cold.
i'm the girl who is perfect at her self destruction.
