You are a getaway car, A rush of blood to the head
But me, I'm just the covers on top of your bed
You steer away in a rear view mirror, you make my head swim
I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done they're all scrambling
And we're friends, yeah we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt
Oh yeah, you caught me. But I caught you one worse
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war."
But who are you fighting for?
The tides out, the ship's run aground
We drown traitors in shallow water
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done they're all scrambling
And we're friends, yeah we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories not the fame
At lease everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame
Such a shame
