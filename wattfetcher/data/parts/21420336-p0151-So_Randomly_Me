So my cousin's family and I were trying to raise money for diabetes right
some people were extremely nice and gave us money
but some person ignored us 3 times
Me: IF YOU CAN AFFORD THOSE BREAST IMPLANTS YOU CAN AFFORD TO HELP SOMEONE BY GIVING A DOLLAR YOU ASS
gosh I wasnt even just saying that
she had breast implants
they were all over the place
And then we saw her twice more
some people cant even give two cents to help someone when they need it
My cousin had diabetes and he was there and I can't imagine how he felt seeing all those people who didn't care
the only ones who did were people who either knew people or had diabetes
After a person left I muttered, "I dont want to live in this world anymore."
BUT BUTWE ALL GOT A TOTAL OF 150 DOLLARS YAYMY GROUP GOT 54 SO I THANK THE GODS THAT NOT EVERYONE IS HEARTLESS
