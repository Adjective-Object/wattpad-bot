Meanwhile; in Olympus
~Third Person~
Aphrodite rushed to the throne room, crying."What's wrong, Aph?" Ares asks, concerned."One of my OTPs, ruined! Ruined!" She screamed.Zeus overheard. "Maybe we should have a meeting about this. Now."
The gods assembled. "Ugh. Is something not perfect again? Did your stupid hairbrush fall into New York?" Athena growled at Aphrodite."Not looks anymore, Athena!" Aphrodite yelled at her. "An OTP is ruined!""Do I look like I care?!""Girls, stop it!" Zeus chimed in. "Let's talk about this so Aphrodite destroy a city just because of her petty lovey things.""Okay, Aphrodite. What exactly is that ruined OTP?" Hephaestus asked.She brought out an orb and it showed two figures sitting side by side at the foot of an Athena statue. "Reynico."
"What the Hades!?" Athena exclaimed. "You mean Death Breath's kid with the Roman?"
"Did someone call?" A deep voice suddenly said. Then a black robed guy appeared before them. Hades.
"Brother. What are you doing here?" Poseidon asked."I hear you talking about my son." Hades replied. "What's wrong with Nico?""His love life has something wrong with it." Aphrodite replied."Wait. Did I hear that he likes a Roman?! That's just plain wrong!""That is not actually the problem. This is."The orb showed them the ceremony. And the scene when Will hugged Nico. How he blushed in his presence. "He's gay."
"NOOOOOO! MY ONLY SON! HE'S NOT GAY! MY ONLY BOY! MY SON CANNOT BE GAY! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Hades threw a big fit.
"IS THAT MY SON!?" Apollo screamed. "NOOOOOOOOO! WILL! YOU ARE A MAN! YOU ARE NOT GAY! STAY AWAY FROM HIM! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
"Wow. Fathers are getting defensive." Poseidon commented.
"NICO, I WOULD RATHER HAVE YOU WITH THE ROMAN GIRL THAN HAVE A GAY AS A CHILD!"
"WILL! YOU ARE A MAN! DON'T YOU HAVE GOOD LOOKS LIKE ME TO CHARM THE LADIES!? YOU ARE NOT GAY!"
"Enough now, big daddy-yos!" Aphrodite yelled. "Back to the meeting!"
"Okay." Hades calmed down. "Anything but see them like that!"
"Well, I have read some of Will's thoughts at that time and I saw that he doesn't like Nico that way." Athena began. "He has a secret goal. To teach Nico about girls and try to get him with Reyna."
"Oh, thank you, Athena." Hades and Apollo sighed in relief.
"But sadly, Reyna disappeared."
"Now what are we going to do?" Apollo grumbled.
"I'm thinking about messing things up to say something is wrong in the universe; then when they get together; POOF! Things go back to normal. Ah, such a tragic story..." Aphrodite suggested.
"Okay. I'm in as long as it isn't Percabeth. Grrr..." Athena shruddered.
"We're in!" yelled the rest of the gods.
Sorry if I judged gays too much. It's just that; that's how a dad would react in this country if they first found out his son is gay. But they learn soon enough how to accept it. Also; our definition of gay is a guy who walks and talks like a girl, often made fun by kids, and many have viral YouTube videos. So yeah.
