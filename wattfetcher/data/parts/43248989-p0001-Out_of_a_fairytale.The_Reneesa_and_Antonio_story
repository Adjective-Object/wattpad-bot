Reneesa's P.O.V
"OMG, Sridevi hurry up we're late for biology!!"
"OK, OK , alright I'm coming I'm coming!!"
Yup hi, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Reneesa Nicholson, I'm 17 years old and screaming at my best friend in the whole wide world, Sridevi Brightwood to hurry up with her books and get to class.I knew going to Starbucks when we were 15 minutes late for school was a bad idea but Sridevi just had to have her cupoccinos. God, she's a crazy one, but I love her anyways.
"OK OK let's make a run for it" Sridevi declared when she was done.
Oh.....great.
"But I really don't want to get all sweaty." I whined but Sridevi didn't take that for an answer.
"Do you really want to get yelled at my Mr.Wellington?"
I shook my head no.
"Good. Now LETS GO!!"Sridevi practically yelled at me.
We ran like there was no tomorrow. We bolted in the classroom just as sir was about to mark me absent.
"Here,I'm here!!" I yelled
"yeah,me too!" Sridevi said as we took our seats.
"You're both late." He said staring at us.
"Sorry,won't happen again." We both chorused. But it was a big lie. Of course it will happen again.
He just rolled his eyes at us, obviously knowing we potentially lied.
"OK class, I have a special announcement to make," Mr.Wellington began, "we will be having a new student joining us today." Some students groaned at this,some seemed amused, I just listened.
"As I was saying" sir continued, "his name is Antonio Mohammed and he will be transferring over from Eastwood Prep to here because he is absolutely amazing at football (soccer, for the American readers). He should be here any minute." Sir finished.Finally.
Then there was a knock at the door and it gently opened.A boy with curly,black hair popped his head in and stared around the class with his chocolate brown eyes. He was kinda cute.
"Is this Mr.Wellington's classroom?" He asked. He had a really deep voice.
"Yes,yes it is. Why don't you come in and introduce yourself, don't be shy." Sir said jokingly.
"OK, Hi everyone my name is Antonio Mohammed and I'm here from Eastwood Prep to be on the football team here and I'm very happy to be at this school and on one of the best football teams in the country."
I somehow managed to listen to every single word he said. What's up with me today?? Am I somehow losing it??.His words were like a song in my mind that wants to be played over and over and over.
"OK Antonio, you can go sit next to...........aha! Reneesa." OMG why did Breana, the girl who sits next to me, have to get sick today??
"Hi, you must be Reneesa, its nice to meet you." He said as soon as he sat down and he put his hand out for me to shake it.
"Hey, its nice to meet you too." I said shaking his hand. It was warm.
"So I hear you play football really well, you must have started practicing really young, right?" I asked coolly nonchalantly.
"Oh,yeah I started practising when I was four years old with my dad." He said and I listened.
