"Mhm." He said and looked out the window.
"You okay?"
"Yeah I'm fine, I'm just still kind of in shock that I'm sitting in the back of a cab talking to my favorite singer about college. I never imagined that something like this would ever happen."
"Yeah, I bet it's surreal."
"Imagine sitting in a cab with the lead singer of like Pantera. That's what this feels like." He said smiling. "It's really, really weird."
"Oh that's weird." I said. God this is so awkward.
"Sorry, you probably don't want to talk about something like that. I promise I'm not just some little fanboy or whatever it's just going to take some getting used to is all."
"You might want to, you're going to be around us for a while."
He laughed, "I know I will. I swear I'm getting more used to it don't worry." He said, "You should have seen me when I met Lynn, I almost had a heart attack. But it's not like that anymore."
"She is pretty cool."
"Yeah she is. Anyways, I promise I'll try not to be too awkward and weird about all of this." He said as the cab stopped in front of the store.
"Tonight you'll get to really know everyone. Everyone will be at the campfire including Of Mice. It'll be fun." I told him getting out of the cab. Kellin followed after me after paying the cab driver.
"Eh I don't know, I'm not really into the campfire party kind of thing." He told me as we walked in, "I'll probably just stay in the bus and work on an assignment I have to send in soon."
"Come on, just stay and hang out for a little while. Alan will be there."
"Yeah and he's probably going to be busy taking pictures the whole time. If you haven't realized he doesn't exactly pay attention to anything when he's in the 'zone."'
"The zone?"
He shrugged, "That's what he calls it. It's when he's too busy taking pictures to notice anything around him because he's concentrated solely on that task." He told me rolling his eyes,
"He takes its seriously I'm guessing."
"You have no idea."
"How long have you two known each other?"
"For like five years now. I think." He said.
"High school friends?"
"Yeah, we actually met when he was a sophomore and I was a senior. I had to tutor him in math."
"That's nice."
He laughed and shook his head, "Not really, he was a bratty little kid, still is sometimes."
"Really?"
"Mhm, it's entertaining sometimes. Especially when he doesn't get his way." He said and I grabbed a grocery basket. "What all do we have to get?"
"Campfire stuff. So s'mores stuff, booze etc."
"Oh, okay I guess we should start with the food huh?" He said and I nodded.
"Yeah that'd be a good start." I told him and we started to the snack aisles, "I still think you should show up to the campfire."
"I don't know."
"Oh come on it'll be fun."
"Maybe, but I'll probably be bored the whole time."
"You'll be surrounded by people, there'll be someone to talk to all the time."
