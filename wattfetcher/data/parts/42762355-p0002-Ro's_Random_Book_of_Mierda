I can't be the only one who wants this to be a ship, right? I'm just following all the political shit, while fangirling... ; 7 ;
Okay, is Greece x Belgium complete crack? They don't have history, but the shit now is just... //struggling with breathing// I've seen some fanart of it and loved it... It isn't even incest qwq
Wait-- Is Rome Greece's father?
It would be adorable. Their personalities kind of match in my point if the view! And Belgium reminds everyone of a cat, while Greece is in love with them.
Boom! Personafication cats. Nekotalia already exists tho... But who cares? ^w^
Let me ship this, please--
