Hey guys, sorry I haven't really been posting cosplay pictures and stuffs lately.But I have some great news.My friend Kai (that cosplays as Blair) is having a birthday party in a cabin for three days.I don't remember where it's at though.All I really know is that, we're going to be making cosplay skits over there.Kai and a few of her other friends asked me to cosplay as Kakashi, they said they already have the cosplay, so I don't have to buy anything. Im going to be borrowing it from my friend Abby. Also I am bringing my itachi cosplay for one of my other friends to wear in the skit.
My other friend Claire is gonna be Sakura,  Abby's Sasuke and Kai is Naruto. Im either going to be itachi or Kakashi, haven't really decided yet. I'm super excited.The party starts on the 25th of this month.So by around that date I would've hopefully posted some pictures by then.I'm super happy because i'm finally gaining some cosplay friends.When I first got into it I didn't know anybody that liked it the way I did.So yeah I'm happy ,now I have some friends to be stupid in wigs with.Oh I just remembered I might post a pic of my newly styled itachi wig.One of my friends is a pro cosplayer when she gets back from the con she's at right now she said she would help me fix my wig.It's really messy. So hopefully I have it fixed before I leave for the party. Well that's all for now. Be on the lookout for more updates.
