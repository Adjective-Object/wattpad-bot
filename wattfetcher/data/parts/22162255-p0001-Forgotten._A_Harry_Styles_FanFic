"Elizabeth! Wake up now or I'll take my belt off and whip you like what happened last night is that what you want!" I heard Chris call from downstairs. I jumped out of my bed scared to death that he would come upstairs and whip me anyways.
"I'm up! I'm up! Please don't come up here!" I pleaded, I wish my mother never married that man. If only she knew. I plugged in my curling iron and waited for the green light to indicate that it's ready. It takes forever for that light so during that time I take out all my bottles of foundation and cover up my scars. I don't even know why I try, no one will notice me, no one will care, all that's gonna happen today is get things thrown at me. If only they knew how much words can hurt a person. I didn't do anything to them. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I just took a knife to my neck and slit my throat. Who am I kidding? No one will even notice that I'm gone.
After I got done getting ready I went downstairs, my step dad was lying on the couch with a bottle of whiskey. "Ha! Your pathetic! No one cares about you Lizzy!" Chris said.
"Don't call me Lizzy." I muttered, not making eye contact. Chris got off the couch and walked over to me. "You can't even look at me in the eyes, look at me when I'm talking to you,do you understand?"  I flinched as he rose his voice. I nodded my head and got past him and ran out the door. I walked to school since I live a block away from school. I need to lose some weight anyways.
Great, it's Harry Styles, he's sitting on a bench right in front of school, there's no way I can ignore him. "Hey look it's the loser. Ha! She's wearing ugly clothes again. Hey Liz where did you get that shirt the dumpster? She's pathetic." Harry said, I just kept walking, all I was wearing is a floral skirt and a white shirt. I didn't think it was that bad but what can I say no one likes what I wear or me to begin with. I walked into chemistry, and sat down taking out my homework. Two minutes later Harry comes in and sits next to me.
"Alright class I have big news!" Mr. Ransom says.
"You got a girlfriend." Harry said sarcastically, everyone snickers and laughs.
"Harry Styles, I should have known a rude comment would come from your mouth. Anyways, back to what I was saying the big news is that there is a new project. It will be due On the 28th of December and it's everything you learned this unit. You will have to work on this project outside of school. Your partner will be the person your sitting next to."
Oh cool, wait what! I'm working with Harry Styles, the guy that would smile from ear to ear if I was hit by a bus. "So your house or mine?" Harry leaned over and said to me. "Um I'll just do it myself and I'll put your name on it." I said I don't want to spend anymore time with him then I have to, or I'll run out of room on my body to cut. "No I want to help, at the end of the day wait by the gate and we will go to my house and work on the project." He said, I gulped and took a breath. "Ok."
