Justin POV
I was sitting on the couch waiting for kylie I was extremely worried   what if something happened to her  then I heard the phone ring and I ran to the phone
Hello  I said quickly  hoping it was kylie instead it was Kylie's mom  and it sounded like she seemed as if she had been crying which made me cry cause I thought of the worst
Justin its kylie she's ...  Her mom cried
She's what .. is my baby ok.  Please tell me she's ok
Justin she was in a accident and she in the hospital and well your car is well totalled
My baby  I cried out  what hospital where ...when I said asking her. Like a thousand questions
The one  by the dollor general justin plz hurry I don't know if  she's gonna be around   much longer
With those words I grabbed my keys and our phones  and  flew out the door  and got in the car tears filling up in my eyes
I rushed to the hospital not stopping for stop signs or red lights not even for cars.
When I reached the hospital I parked the car and ran in the hospital  letting nothing stop me   " justin "  then I heard someone yelled and I jerked my head to see a fragile pale and weak version of kylie's mom along with her father confronting his wife and I walked over to them
"Is she ok" I asked instantly
" shes in surgery they told us we could sit in a waiting room outside  the room their gonna put her in " her mom said sniffling
" let's go then " I said walking with them behind a set of double doors to a waiting room big enough for us and who ever else comes
" I called your mom and  dad and kylie friends  before you got here " Kylie's mom   added
We sat there for what felt like hours before a docter finally  came out and I jumped up
How is she doc  I said  prepared for the worst
She's in a coma  so we put her in a room  but  shes very strong   it could have been worst
Can I go see her
Yeah sure son
Ok I said following the docter to the room
What I saw wasn't kylie it was worst it was a broken kylie she had cast on her leg and she was cover in bruises  and she looked pretty bad  the docter left me alone in the room with her so I pulled up and a chair and put it right beside Kylie's bed and grabbed a hold on her hand
" I love you baby girl your strong I know you will make it out of this alive you have to your my world my everything I  cannt lose you " I cried to her  I would do anything to take your place in this bed to feel the pain your feeling " then I held her hand and then I put my hand down and started singing
"If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would"
