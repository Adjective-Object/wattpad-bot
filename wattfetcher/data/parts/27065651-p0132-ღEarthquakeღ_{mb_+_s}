Hey guys, so tomorrow, I'm going on a class trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and to Hershey Park. It's an overnight thing, so I won't be back until late Friday night. I'll be on my phone, but if we're talking RPing, etc. replies will probably be slow, because Hershey Park, if you didn't know, is filled with rides and roller coasters, and it's a Gettysburg museum we're going to. I think that's it. Oh, wait, tomorrow night is a dinner dance during the trip, so I won't be on then, probably. Honestly, don't expect me back until at least nine thirty on Friday. The buses we're taking might have wifi, but I don't know.
