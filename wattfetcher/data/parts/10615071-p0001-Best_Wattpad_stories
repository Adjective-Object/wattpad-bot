Description:
"And maybe in the end, in spite of all we said, all we did, all we met, we are only thoughts that evaporate into the effervescent whirlwind of time."
Cole Winters is a perfect example of high school done right; star quarterback, good-looking, popular, he has the whole package. Things couldn't possibly go wrong. He lives for the present with no certainty on the future or anything it holds. Grace Loving is terminally ill. She's been cancer-free, but it can't be gone forever. She knows it. Everybody knows it. And it's only a matter of time before she bites it. But to maximize her living expectancy, her parents bring her to a well-known doctor operating a hospital just outside of Heart, North Carolina, where she finds her new home and, ultimately, Cole Winters.
It's not love at first sight. It's not even love at fourth sight. But as they're thrown together in odd and unsavory circumstances, it becomes a battle between love and the desire not to hurt or be hurt, and the realization that in life you cannot have one without the other.
