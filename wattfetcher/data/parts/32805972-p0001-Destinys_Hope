Crickets chirped and a stream ran smoothly as the moonlight shined on a rock.  A teenager was there on the rock sitting with his sword jabbed in the rock while looking up at the moon.  He just stood there, looking up, his shirt was black an blue, black hair, brown eyes and jeans. "JADEN!" A person was running up the hill Jaden was on, "JADEN!" He yelled again. Jaden turned around, "Huh? What is it Simon!" "GO ONE SPIT IT OUT!" He added impatiently. "CHAOTIC'S ARMY! THEY'RE ATTACKING!HALF THE VILLAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN WHIPED OUT WE HAVE TO RUN!NOW!" Simon said trying to catch his breathe. Jade stayed speachless with fear. A gun shot was heard. Jaden and Simon looked back to see the village on fire. Jaden went to run back to the village but was grabbed by Simon, "MAYA!MAYA!!!!!" Jaden screamed for his little sister.

Simon made sure to keep a grip on Jadens arm, "WE HAVE TO GO LEAVE HER I HATE TO SAY IT BUT WE HAVE TO GO WITHOUT HER!" Simon yelled. Jaden flipped his hand around grabbing Simons wrist nit breaking it but tranquilizing it.  Jaden ran off towards the village to his house, "MAYA!MAYA WHERE ARE YOU!MAY- he saw Maya come out holding her teddy bear and blanket crying, "Brother?..." she said weakly whike crying hugging her teddy bear and holding her blanket. Jaden looked at Maya, "MAYA THANKGO-" he stopped and looked at Maya. Maya fell to the floor past out from all the smoke and heat.  Jaden ran over to Maya, "MAYA!" He slid his hand under her head and picked her up and ran as fast as he could back to where him and Simon where.  Jaden saw Simon laying down coverd in blood with a bullet to the heart. Jadens eyes filled with fear and ran off holding carrying Maya.

Jade hid in a cave with Maya laying her down and put her blanket over her and put her teddy bear next to her, "Dont worry Maya....i wong let any harm come to you..i prommise.." he said quietly.
