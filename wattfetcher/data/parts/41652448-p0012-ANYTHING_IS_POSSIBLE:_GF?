Pacifica starts pulling on Dipper's shirt. Lol

Pacifica: WHAT DO WE DO? WHAT DO WE DO?

Dipper: don't worry, it can get worse than this.

just then, of course things get worse. A skeleton appears out of the fire with an axe in his head. The skeleton started to grow skin and when was done they noticed it was the same lumberjack from the picture. Dipper and Pacifica go underneath the table. "I SMELL A NORTHWEST!" The ghost starts dragging his axe around "come out. Come out where every you are.

Pacifica: hurry! Read through your dumb book already!

Dipper: im looking. And its not dumb, ok? This book is gonna save our lives. *turns to page where it says advice* alright here we go, advice. *turns on a light that able to see invisible ink*

under adivice: PRAY FOR MERCY

Dipper: aw seriously?

Then the table moves and the ghost saw them

Ghost: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE!

Pacifica ca and Dipper get up and run

Pacifica: this way hurry!

We follow them into the dark weird room.

Dipper: what is this place?

Pacifica: that's weird. I don't even know where this room is.

Dipper: hopefully the ghost doesn't earthier.

pacifica:  Yeah maybe were safe.

just then something for behind Pacifica under a cover was reaching out for her. Then Dipper realized it.

Dipper: Pacifica watch out!

Pacifica ca looks behind her and realizes it's the ghost.

Pacifica: ah!

Ghost: Ancient sims!
