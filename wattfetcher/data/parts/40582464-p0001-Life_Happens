Hello world to the world of Wattpad, this is my first story and I hope you like it :]Sorry if you see any punctuation mistakes, I've never been good with punctuation.This story is based on two characters who meet, fall in love, etc. But it's based on real life and not the beautiful romances in books, the story will have sad moments, awkward situations etc. And I may post an alternate ending if people don't like the first ending. So I'm going to let you read on now and I'm going to stop rambling so enjoy! :]P.s. I'm not the best author in the world, I can't compare to J.K. Rowling or Rick Riordam sorry *Riordan, Percy Jackson fans will get that reference. Anyway let the reading commence.
