"Yeah, wow." She said.
"Wow." I said.
"I love you." She said.
"I love you."
We lied there, her looking at me, me looking at the floor and our thoughts being said.
"What if we got married?" She asked.
"What if we did?" I asked.
"What if we had a kid?" She asked.
"What if we did, Erin?"
"What if we broke up?"
"We won't." I said.
"I love you." She said.
"I love my baby." I responded.
"Your baby? Am I your baby?" She asked.
"Duh, I love you." I said looking at her lips before kissing her.
"What if you didn't?" She asked.
"I do and will never stop." I said taking her hand with both of mine.
"What if we don't want to live together after we already do?" She asked.
"We wont, now stop with your what if's, your making me nervous." I said. She hugged me and gave me a kiss before "What if"ing again.
"What if we couldn't have a kid?" She asked.
"Well... do you think that would happen? I'm not ready for a kid and I won't be for... a while." I said.
"I know... just -- what if?" She asked.
"Well, at least you have a kid already." I said.
"Yeah, but... what if?" She asked taking my hand.
"Stop "what if"ing, I'm really nervous about it now. What if we don't want to live together? What if we can't have a child? Just, what if? God, now I'm saying it." I said.
"I love you."
"I love you."
We finally got up at around 10:30 and ate something, we were starving.
