I like Tigerstar because I imagine him if he was a loyal warrior. If he never had the mentor, Thistleclaw, then he would probably be one of the greatest warriors and maybe even leader of ThunderClan. I know he always felt like a ShadowClan cat, but he could still be good? I also live his colors. He was actually a softie on the inside. He hated Firestar because Firestar reminded him of his father, Pinestar. He secretly always felt bad for Cinderpelt's injury. His heart broke when he got exiled, he had to part from Goldenflower, Dustpelt, Darkstripe, and Whitestorm (His mate/friends. Whitestorm was his childhood BFF, close like brothers.). He also missed Lionheart a LOT, after he died in the attack. He and Redtail were good friends, but Thistleclaw corrupted him as an apprentice and pretty much told him no mercy and be strong. He killed Redtail with a heavy heart to be honest. Yipper yapper...thats it ya'll x3
