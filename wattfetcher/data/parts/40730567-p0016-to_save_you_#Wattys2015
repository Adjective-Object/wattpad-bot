According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate beings, condemning them to spend the rest of their lives in search of their other halves.

He had no clue why he had sent that message. He just felt like talking, since it had been a day since she messaged. About two minutes later, he got a reply. It was the first time he was nervous to open a message. He had never been nervous, not even when, his ex-girlfriend, had first messaged him. So why was he so nervous now?
What if she thinks I'm some nerd?
What if she has no freaking clue of what I am talking about?
He felt like a preteen girl with a crush. He took a deep breath and opened the message.

Jake had sent that message after a lot of thought. But for the first time in his life, he didn't regret doing something.

In the beginning was Chaos (shapeless nothing) who had two children: Night (darkness) and Erebus (death). All was black, empty, silent, endless. Mysteriously, Love was born of darkness and death.
