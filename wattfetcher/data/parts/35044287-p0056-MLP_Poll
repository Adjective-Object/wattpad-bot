Excuse me real quick. *runs off scream* YES! FINALLY! TAKE THAT CELESTIA!! Sorry it's just I'm not the biggest Celestia fan. However I do hate her less then I did before thanks to that funny scene with her and Luna in the 100th episode! But yeah there are other ponies now that I dislike more than her like Snips, Snails, Sombra, and a few others. So yeah. Anyway if you voted out Celestia then you get to vote again. So Let's Get Started!

And the nominees are:
LUNA: Use to be jealous of her older sister and turned into Nightmare Moon. Was banished to the moon for 1000 years, but then later returned and was changed back to normal by the Elements of Harmony. Is the Princess of the Night!
CADENCE: Is Twilight's old Filly sitter. Eventually married Shinning Armor and became Twilight's Sister-in-Law. Is the ruler of the Crystal Empire. Is the Princes of Love (Or some may say Merchandising)
Good luck to the nominees!
