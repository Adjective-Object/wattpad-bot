"I will call upon your name, keep my eyes above the waves, my soul will rest in your embrace, I am yours and you are mine." I finish, they all clapped and Jake closes his eye again, Riley smiled. "What are you hiding?" I asked, she shook her head smiling.
"Uh okay." I said, I put my guitar down and they put on a movie, I hug Cameron again. "Thanks for being my sister." he mumbled, "Thanks for being my obnoxious, annoying, retarded, stupid, wrong brother but I love you for it." I list they start to laugh, I chuckle, "Me too." he said kissing my cheek, "You have ten seconds to get your wet lips off of me-" I started then he licked my cheek.
"EW CAMERON!" I shout starting to laugh, I wipe it off, and he sits next to Nash, I sit on Hayes, "I love you." he whispered, "aww I hate you." I smile, "What?" He asked smiling, "Im kidding babe, I love you too." I said kissing him, I slid my legs under the covers with his.
I laid on his side and Jake stood up stretching then went up to Cameron biting his ear, "Ow, Keegan what he heck!" He screamed laughing I started to laugh, "Good boy Jake." I smile, he barks and jumps on me, "You are a little happy puppy." I smile he rolls on his stomach and I rub him aggressively but playfully and he starts to play bite my finger.
"Goodnight." I told him, he fell asleep, "Good morning." I said he wagged his tail and licked my hand, "Hayes he wants to be like you." I chuckled, he laughs, and Jake falls asleep.
I kiss Hayes, I sit on him and he moves his hands to my waist, I lay down, falling asleep, "Goodnight." I whisper, "Goodnight." he whispers kissing my head.
