Yes, dad?
You're late. He sighed as I finally caught up to them. The large familiar white wolf looked up at me before looking over at the large pitch black wolf. Without another word, the white wolf took off running in the opposite direction.
Lets move quickly. Our dad instructed as Rye ran behind him quickly. With all my might, I ran as fast as I could to catch up to them. It wasn't much longer until we stood in front of a large river.
They're coming. My dad added, standing up tall at the water's edge along with Rye as I lifted my head and sniffed the air while listening carefully. I didn't know who they were but the intoxicating yet addictive scent slapped me across my face.
"Mate." My wolf whispered, finally speaking as she quickly took over before the sudden rustling of the bushes made us perk up as we watched and waited cautiously.

Hello!
What do you all think of the first chapter?
Yes, I do indeed know that it doesn't make sense. Feel free to critique me, I need it.
More updates tomorrow.
Also this is the sequel to The Alpha's Daughter :)
