3:55I think I messed up big time...that explain why she's avoiding me...
I don't know,maybe I'm reading into it meh..but if I'm not...
I wonder why I'm such a chicken...that even when I AM in a relationship I can't change..and I'm pretty sure it's affecting the relationship too...
Idk maybe I wasn't ready for a relationship if I can't even French kiss...is that bad?
No!ugh it's just when I think about it, it seems so disgusting I mean who wants to have tong slobber all over the inside of their mouth??bleh...so you can't really blame me...
You know it's suppose to be the other way around...the boy is suppose to be the dominant one NOT the shy one about take steps..
I should be the one saying ,"we should French kiss or whatever." Right?shouldn't it be the boy NOT the girl?
idk,maybe I wasn't ready for a relationship if I'm still shy.I'm just not that type of guy who wants to do that kind of stuff..
Maybe I rushed into it too fast...I mean..if I can't even do a simple..tong kiss..
But wtf :/ shouldn't the kiss come at the right moment NOT when a stupid app game of TRUTH OR DARE says to freaking French kiss?!
I'm sure ill make it through though...cuz I got a great girlfriend..
