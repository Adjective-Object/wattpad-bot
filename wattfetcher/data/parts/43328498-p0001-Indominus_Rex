Log entry one: they made a new dinosaur. I don't now what dinosaurs they've used to make it but it's name is the indominus Rex. that makes it pretty obvious that they used T. rex DNA to make it.
Log entry two: I snuck into the lab and overheard someone say, the indominus Rex has cuttel fish dna, snake dna and T. rex dna in it. and that is all I can tell you because After that I ran back to my house and pretended I was asleep.
Log entry three: the indominus Rex is smart, very very smart. It found where the food came out and one man nearly lost a arm and the other one, well... He didn't even see it coming.
