If you're reading this then know a few things: you're special. Of course you are. Why else would you be here?
And beautiful. So beautiful I can't even begin to describe. And not just the way you look but as a person as well.
You are smart, talented, funny, nice and so much more. You can accomplish such great things.
Because, most importantly, you are STRONG. Strong enough to win this fight. Strong enough to live to see another day. Because whatever challenges you are facing, you are stronger than them.
