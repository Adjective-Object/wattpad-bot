I thought we were just going to let her die?  A man's gravely voice said.

Change of plans. She has more potential then we originally thought. Another more mature man's voice said.

Do you have a plan?

I always have a plan.

I lay there. I couldn't open my eyes. All was black. I could hardly make out the words. Then, I stopped hearing entirely.

Sunlight streamed through the window across the room. I looked around. I had switched rooms. This one was still bleach white walls and white ceiling and white tile floor. I saw an IV and machines. I wanted to move. To sit up and look around. But none of my muscles would work. I turned my head and saw for the first time, a leather chair, worn by years of use.
He just sat there. Staring straight ahead. His hands were gripping the edge of the seat, causing his veins to pop out. Bucky. He sat there. My heart nearly broke at the sight of him. He had small cuts and scratches on his visible arm. But that wasn't what caught my eye. It was his face. He looked so sad. His face was pale, and his eyes dark. I saw his jaw clench and unclench.
He sat within arms reach of my bed. I stretched out a hand and saw for the first time how beat up it looked up. I closed my eyes and remembered the blade I had held on to. Scars were already forming on the smaller cuts. The longer deeper ones still had stiches in  them. I hesitated and then gently touched his arm. He jumped a tiny bit.
His eyes widened when he saw me.

Hi. I whispered. My voice sounded strange.

Bucky just looked at me. I got lost in his eyes. The last thing I saw before black again, was the endless sea of blue of his eyes.
