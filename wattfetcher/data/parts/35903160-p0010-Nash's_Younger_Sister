I haven't came out of my room since Kylie died but today was the funeral so I had to.I had to give a speech about her.I could write a book about her.I go get dressed in:•Black lace dress•Black 6' heels•And put on a infinity necklaceI go downstairs."Hey guys lets go,"I tell them."First eat breakfast so you won't be hungry later,"My mom says as I nod."So sis what you going to say about her?"Nash questioned me."Everything I could put in the book that I could write about her life,"I answer."Lets go,"Taylor tells us."Ok,"I answer.-skip car ride-"Ok let's have Kylie's best friend come up her,"the pastor says."Hi I'm Mia Grier.Kylie was my best friend.We did everything together.But I wish she could be here with us she has left us,and we will always love her.I remember when we first met she said'We'll always be friends till death.'But now her death has come.We were basically sisters since how close we were.We have been friends since the age of 3 I love her thanks for coming out.Bye,"I say.I then run to my secret spot in the woods only 1 other person knows about this spot.Kylie and she's dead so no one else.I start sobbing how could she die at the age of 16.She was my sister that's not related by blood."Hey Mia,"a guy says."Who are you?"I ask the voice."Shawn,"Shawn says."I need her here or she needs me there,"I tell him."Mia I've learned a lot about you.You are pretty and you would sacrifice your life for Kylie,"he says."Thanks for coming now 1 other person knows about this.Thats alive.Shawn when I heard you sing I always feel like I can do anything.Thanks Shawn,"I say then kiss his cheek."I'm going back home I already said my speech and tomorrow is Hayes' birthday.So bye Shawn."I go the short way home."Hey guys I'm going to sleep goodnight tell-" I get cut off by the front door opening."Shawn goodnight and love you all,"I say.
