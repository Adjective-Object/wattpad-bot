1. All of the characters either belong to Ever After High (EAH), some of my followers on Instagram or myself. At the end of the chapter (the author note), I will say what characters belong to who.
2. All conflicts, rising actions, climax, falling actions, conclusion, events, beginnings, and everything else (unless I say it doesn't) belong to me
3. I will try and get as much true as possible. If I make a mistake, please correct it (I really don't care. Demi Lovato song pun unattended).
4. If you follow me on Instagram, you will get sneak peaks and much more on the story. My Instagram username is in my bio and I will put it here -> page_chapter
5. Enjoy and I hope you like!
