I can't do this.... not without mum. Terra says to her dad crying, knees bended and the photo of her mum in her hand.Of course you can honey it's just a move-out. Look I know it's hard to leave your mum's place but don't you wanna see our new flat? Her dad says to her feeling pitiful for her.You can take your mum's stuff, anything that reminds you of her but we have to go on now pack your suitcase and go change you have an hour. Her dad instructs her.The door slams shut. First black mark on your paper Terra she keeps telling herself after her mum died a month ago.Her life was never like this until her mum died. She never suffered never sad never lost anything until her mum diedShe collected her things and clothes and took her mother's heels she wore on a picnic day. Her photo of her with her blonde hair falling over her green eyes. Identical to Terra. But Terra had brown hair and blue eyes.Terra cried as she saw the photo now that she has suffered of loss of half of her heart.Terra it's about time. Ready for a change? Her dad asked her holding her shoulder.Ready she announced.The sound of the van of Gummy for furniture transport has filled the breeze. As Terra hopped on her home was crushed.She never knew that moving is one of the highlights of her black board.
