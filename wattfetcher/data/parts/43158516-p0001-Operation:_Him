Life, struggle, pain. These are the things I get for being in this situation. My name is Ashley. I'm 14 years old. Doctors say my life has becoming to an end. But one doctor proves them wrong. He knows that I will get better. He knows I have been enough pain. But my question is...... It's not a what it's a who is he.
Dr. Howard: Good morning Miss Martin... My name is Dr. Howard. I Will be taking care of you. Are you ready for your surgery?
Ashley: Yes but I'm kinda scared.
Dr. Howard: don't worry about a thing my dear. Everything will be okay. I'm going to just take a quick look at you and we will begin shortly.
Ashley: Okay.
Dr. Howard checked my eyes ears nose and mouth. He listens to my heart too. When he was finished, my mom and dad kiss me on the forehead and wish me luck. I saw a nurse in blonde she looks so cute. She goes by the name of Olivia.
She got the needle prepped and I turned my face away. Once when the needle was in, I saw Dr. Howard shows up.
Dr. Howard: Ready?
I nod my head and they wheeled me in the emergency room.
Ashley: Mommy daddy don't let him take me! *in tears.*
Mom: It will be okay Ashley dad and I will be waiting in the waiting room.
