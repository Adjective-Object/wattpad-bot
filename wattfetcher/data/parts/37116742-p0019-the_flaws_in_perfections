"leave them alone they don't want you there"
He, speaking of the only group I ever cared to fit in with. The only place I've ever wanted to be the only person I ever wanted to please.
I'm giving up.
This constant suffering causes me nothing but hate for myself. I'm going to let it end me.
So long, I'm saying goodbye
Maybe I will see clearly in a different life
This life is not where I should be
I won't be long
