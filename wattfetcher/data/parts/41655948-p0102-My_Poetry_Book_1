I want to fade into the shadows like a ghost I want to go places they don't know. I've been listening to All Time Low, I'm on earth, although, I want to explore the galaxy so let's go. I came here in search of piece of mind, I sit in the darkness all the time. But you always remind Me of who I am. - (m.m)
