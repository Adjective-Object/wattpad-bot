Janet
I was looking for somebody to love, not anybody in particular but just somebody. Waves of heat filled the air as I drove through LA with my hair blowing through the wind. I was free-hundereds of miles away from home, but my mom probably didn't give a shit. She was probably getting pity from Mario, her boyfriend.
It didn't bother me though, at least I was left alone and unbothered. Once I reached my motel room I saw a tall honey brown eyed brownskin trying to open his door.
"Um...your suppose to swipe your card from the top, not the bottom." I said as he followed my directions then flashed a million dollar smile.
"Thanks, the names Christopher but you can call me Chris." Chris said as he tried to kiss my hand but I yanked it back before he could.
"Pleasure meeting you and all, bye." I said as I rushed back into my room. I've never interacted with a guy before which really made me nervous. I took a quick shower then hopped into some sweats as I kicked back and watched TV for the night.
I was half asleep until I heard a knock at the door around 10. I looked out the peephole to see him, Chris. I opened the door a bit to see him all dressed up.
"I never caught your name."
"Janet...but is that all your here to ask for?"
"No, I just wanted to take you out to party- get to know you better and all."
"Ok, but it's la-"
"So? No excuses your coming." Chris  said as he made me crack a smile.
"Oooh, fiesty!" I said causing us to both laugh. I don't even know this guy but hey live a little. I threw on a dress I had debated to wear consider the fact it gave off a sexual appeal but it doesn't hurt to show a little skin once and awhile. I did my routine and even add a bit of makeup then off I was.
Once Chris saw my outfit he was speechless himself. "Your lookin really fly tonight." He said as he licked his lips making me blush a bit.
"Your not bad yourself." I said as I examined his outfit. He really did know how to dress for a brother. We headed out to his dope convertible as we went far out to malibu.
