*Jaycie's POV*
I grabbed a glove and put it on. Apparently we were going to start on spring sports. They told me that we were playing softball. I was fine with that as well. I wanted to try and not get kidnapped during the spring and be on the softball team. We were all talking as we went to the field. Then Mr. Smith started separating us into teams. Sadly Danny was in this class, best thing though he was on the other team. I went to left outfield. Chase, Skull, and, one of my other friends, Hunter was on my team. Cool. Chase took 3rd base and Skull took 2nd base. Hunter was a catcher so he was at home plate.
Then that's when I zoned out when Paul linked me. Danny was hitting to.
'Hey, Jaycie?' Paul linked to me
'Yeah, Paul?' I asked hesitantly. Do I really want to get hit or no? Ehh, I'll be fine! I thought mentally waving it off
'Don't worry you aren't in trouble. I was just wondering if you can spend the rest of the day with Tessa. She wants to do a sister bonding thing since she only has a brother.' He said.
'Oh! Thank gosh. Of course I'll do that. Ask Dad if we can let her, Chelsea, and hmm Link?....sleepover. Maybe Thalia, Tania, or or or Lydia.... Actually I know Lydia can't Erick is taking her out as well as Tania. Tania is going out with Skull. Link most likely will say no, so Thalia.' I say as I was thinking thoughtfully.
'Okay Jaycie.' He says while chuckling at me. I rolled my eyes as I raised my arm to stretch. I caught something as I closed my glove. I jumped while holding my glove to myself. I looked at everyone cheer, but Mr. Smith saw that I looked surprised. He looked at me with a slight glare.
'Got to go! Mr. Smith caught me dazing as the ball almost hit my face had I not put my gloved hand up. Bye...' I say in a rush. Oh gosh I'm so in trouble.
'Bye.' He says.
I threw the ball to Chase and he caught it. Mr. Smith yelled towards me.
"Jaycie, stop trying to be a hotshot and pay attention. You should be glad that you had caught that ball. Otherwise you would be going to the nurses office."
"I'm sorry Mr. Smith! I'll pay attention." I say.
Hunter linked to me. He's a werewolf.
'Nice Jaycie! Pay attention though.' He said and sent a thumb's up my way.
'I will.' I said with a smile.
I saw that Danny was pretty angry since it was Danny who hit it. Oh how that makes my day.
*****
After an hour and twenty minutes we had won, much to Danny's disappointment. It was great though. Especially after he had yelled at half of his team, he looked over at me and you know what? I was the one to make the last winning home run. It was 20-17. I had hit it pretty far and got us the last two other people home. We were all so happy. Though the other team lost we told the ones that weren't sore losers great game. We walked inside and changed. I was the first one out of the girls locker rooms. I didn't sweat that much. Most of the hits went to the infield or to right or center fielders. I was really happy that I didn't sweat as much since I have to wear a dress. I didn't smell bad either and I was glad I had deodorant in my book bag. I didn't put the leggings back on and I was mainly wearing extra shoes Mr. Smith gave me. I gave them back and threw the socks away. They were just those fake socks.
