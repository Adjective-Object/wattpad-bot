"Besides that one time yes."
"Who is he?"
"All I know is that he's a murderer, psychopath, and an ignorant man who has no future while my Dad is still alive."
"I bet." He chuckled. "Have you ever gotten any scars from the man and has anyone been kidnaped with you? How many times?"
"Have I ever gotten scars? Mentally and physically. Has people been kidnapped with me? Yes, Ms. Irene, Sam, Mom and I met Talon and a few other people when I was kidnaped at 10. So far the only one to come back alive is the people I met when I first met Talon. I've been kidnaped 5 times in total, but with him it was my last 4 that he had taken me."
"May I see any scars that you have?"
I was surprised at first, but I only lifted an eyebrow. I shrugged and got up. I unzipped my jacket that had a hoody under it. I took the baggy jacket off and put it on the chair. He asked what I was doing, but I ignored him. I took my hood off and turned around. I pulled my shirt up and I heard him gasp and I heard clicks from heels so I just knew Beckett was in here.
"How did you get it?" Beckett asked.
"A whip." I stated and when I was about to put my shirt back on I felt a hand on my back.
"Oh my goodness." He murmured softly and I gulped.
Can't I be in different situations?
