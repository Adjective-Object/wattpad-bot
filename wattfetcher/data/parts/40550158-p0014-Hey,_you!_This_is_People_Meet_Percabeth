"Ya," said Ya.
"Well guess what? We already know," said Percy. His eyes had turned a darker shade of green and he was glaring at Tal. Even though it wasn't directed at me, I still scooted my chair a little way away from him.
"Whatever, lets go girls," Tal grabbed Annabeth's wrist and Ya grabbed Emily's.
"Ow!" said Emily
Annabeth just growled. You could tell she was going to judo-flip him (seriously, she does that to people!) but Percy got there before her, which was weird since she was right next to him and he was on the opposite side of the table. He walked up to them and tore their hands apart. When the Tal tried to punch him, Percy grabbed him hand and twisted it behind his back. He lead him out the door and then pushed him onto the ground. When the guy tried to kick his feet out from under him, he jumped and then stepped on Tal's pinkie. Ouch that must have hurt. While all this was happing, Annabeth sat on the table and watched Percy with an amused face on.
I did something a little less heroic. I took Percabeth's mocha and poorer it all over Ya. The instant later, he let go of Emily's hand and ran out the door yelling,
"YA!!!!!!!!!!"
Emily jumped on my back and kissed my cheek.
"Thank you my prince," she said in a really bad british accent
"Your welcome, my princess," I replied in an equally terrible voice
"With her still on my back, we walked outside to where Percabeth were. They were sitting next to each other on a raised stone walkway. Percy's eyes were still dark, but the color vanished as soon as Annabeth kissed him. They were still making out when Emily and I walked over. Or rather, I walked over with Emily on my back.
" Ec-hem," I fake coughed with grabbed their attention. They pulled away and blushed. When Annabeth saw what Emily was doing, she stood up and jumped on Percy's back. Percy and I groaned while the girls shouted,
"Let the race begin!"
