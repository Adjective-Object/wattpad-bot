"Oh I don't dance, but here I am. Spinning you round and round in circles. It ain't my style, but I don't care. I'd do anything with you anywhere.
I don't dance, but here I am. Spinning you round and round in circles. It ain't my style, but I don't care. I'd do anything with you anywhere. Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl. 'Cause I don't dance."
As the last part of the song finishes Ben and I look at each other and kiss. I feel like sparks flew.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wake up with my head on Ben's lap, and he is playing with my hair. He had picked daisies and put them in my hair. He smiles at me and I smile at him.
"Did you have a nice nap?" He asks me.
"Yes. Yes I did." Then I think back to my dream. Maybe someday that will happen. I sit up. "I love you." I say to him. He just smiles.
"I love you too." Then right as the sun is setting over the lake, we kiss and I can feel that this would be one of those picture worthy moments. It will last in my heart forever. Maybe someday my dream will come true.
