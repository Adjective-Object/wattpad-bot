I got bored..So I made cat ears.. And a tail.Put on my extra wig. I finally discovered what I can use it for.I am volunteering, at a theater camp in New Iberia.The play we are doing is "The Aristocats"They don't have enough people to play all the roles. The teacher says I might have to be Thomas O'Malley in the play if they can't find anyone else.I'm just a volunteer.But If they really need someone, i'll be there.It surprisingly didn't take that long to make.Fabric.. Headband. Hot Glue gun. Stuffing and A coat hanger (it's so it will keep its shape)
