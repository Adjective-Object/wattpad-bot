And so as Elliot met Olly, the first thing he thought to do was to look her up and down and examine her every detail.

Olly was a relatively small and petite girl. She wore a striped crop top and a pair of ragged denim jeans he personally thought were a bit too loose for her, and even her feet seemed a little bigger than their actual size in her particularly clunky pair of Doc Martens. On her back was a yellow Kanken backpack, and an assortment of what seemed to be a handful of colorful badges with different images on them were sewn onto its front. Her short dark hair framed her heart shaped face, and if he looked close enough, he could suddenly see just how winged her eyeliner was.
And all the hypocrite could really think of, was: "Psh, what a hipster."
