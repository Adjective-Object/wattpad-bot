I've heard and have been looking up multiple theories for the 4th game, and some of them seem cool, but some of them are way over the top. I mean, way over the top. One I read said something about trying to stay awake through the night with coffee and stuff so you don't start dreaming and seeing the new nightmare animatronics, and that if you did fall asleep you would start sleep walking around the restaurant...Yeah, sorry to be a Dalione Downer, but I don't think that's gonna happen. But who knows, I'm not Scott, so I can't predict the games accurately. All I can do is state my opinion, and that's what I'm doing. So in the comments please don't be all, "Gosh, who're you to predict the game?!"Â  or, "You're such jerk! I can believe what I want to believe!"
Which you can, and I've seen this happen before to someone just stating their opinions, so I just wanna make sure it doesn't happen to me. So, just to make sure you all get it, THOSEWEREOPINIONS!!
