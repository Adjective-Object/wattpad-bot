Hello. I'm Natalie Roberts. I'm 17 years old and 5' 10" tall. I live in sunny Miami, Florida. I live with my loving mom and loving dad. I have an adorable little brother named Alex. In other words, I'm your typical average teenager.. Ha! If only that were true! You see, I'm nowhere near being normal, even though all my life I had been told that I was normal. I had a normal childhood. I thought I was normal! Not until this year! This is my story of drama, love, heels, dresses, prom, and of how I became the girl, who touched fire.
