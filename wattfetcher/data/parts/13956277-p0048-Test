Hey ! another update like I promised :D
.....
The girls ran out, I opened my arms to hug them but they ignored me, what ?
"Did Damon leave ?" Diana asked sadly, the other girls looked sad too.
"Uh, yeah" I raised an eyebrow at them, they all sighed.
"Do you realize that it's my brother you're talking about ?" Elina raised her eyebrow.
"YOU STOLE MY EYEBROW MOVE TOO ! FAMILY OF THIEFS"
"What ?" Molly, Hannah, Helen and Diana asked in sync.
"nothing" me and Elina answered.
"Well, tell us Leena, why did you come in Damon's car with Elina ?" Diana asked.
"Uh .." Nobody knows that I live with the Carters except them.
"I told her that I'll pick her up" Elina read my face expression and saved me.
"You're lucky, YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SAME CAR AS DAMON" Hannah freaked out.
"Hey, calm down ! it's not a big deal !"
"It IS , He is DAMON CARTER, One of the hottest boys in school, Don't know the hottnessÂ  group?" Diana asked and I burst out laughing.
"W-what?" I continued laughing.
"William, Jake, Damon, Lewis, Tom, Peter and Simon" She explained, Molly coughed.
"What" I asked Molly
"Nothing, shouldn't we get in ?" She asked.
"oh yeah sure" I smiled. We walked into the big house, it was smaller than the Carters' but it was still big and fancy.
"So, what do you wanna do first ?" Molly asked.
"Is there any men here" I asked Molly.
"Just my little brother, he'll go out to his friend's house in minutes" She said.
"Okay" I smiled.
"Watch a movie ?" Elina asked and we all nodded.
The bell rang.
"I'll open" I volunteered.
"It must be one of the younger girls in Elina's class, I invited some of them" Molly said.
"okay" I opened the door.
"Hey"
"WHAT THE- Are you stalking me or something ?" I gave him a burning look.
"Actually no, I came for my friend, he lives here" Jake said. I really hate him.
"there are no boys here" I said.
"Oh hey Jake, My brother is upstairs" Molly said.
"what" I raised an eyebrow.
"Please come in" Molly pushed me away and let Jake walk in.
"Hey girls" Jake waved at them, they started to fangirl over him.
"Hey" I saw a tall boy walk down the stairs. Is that ..
"SIMON" My eyes widened.
"Hey Leena, looking good today" He smiled.
"you told me you only have a little brother" I glared at Molly.
"She's 12 minutes older, we are twins, but we don't look alike" Simon explained.
