"Ace!" Sakura exclaimed wasting no time in hugging her old pal.
"Sa, I see that you're alright." Ace answered ruffling her hair. She snuggled deeper into his warm, bare chest.
"I see that your old man finally complied." Ace noted remembering the last time he saw her when he deliberately crossed the border.
"Yeah, the scales got harder to hide." Sakura admitted showing him the patch of visible white scales on the back of her neck. He looked and merely sighed but in the good way.
"Well, that's good. I was sent to show you to your dorm at Skypiea."
"Where is it? I tried looking but this property is too damn big."
"Well, I invite you to look at the view."
Sakura walked to the edge of the cliff and was amazed. The Academy was huge! The property ran from here to the ocean and that was at least a 6000-mile walk
"C'est belle. This place is as big as a country!" Sakura exclaimed.
"Well, it is a country because a normal lot of land is not enough to hold all these maniacs trust me. We even have our own police force."
"That is so cool."
"Well we better get going." Ace answered with a huge smile while securing his hat. As they walked along, they heard a  loud voice shouting, "AAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEE!"
"Oh shit."
"What?
"Run."
"Huh."
In no, time a boy with raven black hair crashed into Ace and Sakura.
"Yo. Who's that, is she your girlfriend?" Luffy asked Ace being completely oblivious to the fact that they were going to fall over a cliff.
"No, she isn't." Ace answered with an irk mark also being completely oblivious to cliff.
"M-Minna." Sakura stuttered holding onto Luffy's arm for dear life. Ace and Luffy finally looking at the fear-stricken girl, realized what's happening.
"Aaaaaaaaaah!!!!!! We're falling off a cliff!!!!!"
"Baka!"
They were falling rapidly.
"We're going to die!" Sakura yelled holding Luffy's arm tighter.
"Luffy, if she dies I will kill you." Ace threatened stretching Luffy's mouth.
"OK." Luffy answered simply and dived down faster than the others
Luffy:  Gomu Gomu no Fuusen (balloon).
Ace bounced off the inflated Luffy and Sakura landed right on top of him deflating him a bit.
Sakura looked around and started bouncing on him.
"Stop it!" Luffy chuckled. Sakura laughed and kept on bouncing until Luffy finally deflated and Sakura finally landed on his belly.
"Luffy, you're too hard."
