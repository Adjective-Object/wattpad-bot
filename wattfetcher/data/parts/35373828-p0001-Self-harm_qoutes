Hey every one this is a book where there will be self harm, suicide,eating disorder, anxiety, and depression quotes.

I use to self harm, I am trying to stop.

I do not encourage you to harm yourself in any way.

If you have any questions, comments, or anything please feel free to comment through out the book.

I would love to hear/read what you have to say.

If you ever just want to tell me something but you don't want to comment it, message it to me.

Unfortunately I can't message me back.

I can get messages though.

When I can message back I will let you know.

Thanks so much and yeah...
