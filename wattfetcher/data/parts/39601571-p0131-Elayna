Hey guys 👋🏼So my phone is acting really weird these past few days. And all my chargers broke.
So I don't know when I'll be getting a new charger and fixing my phone, until then I'm going to take a small break.
I don't want to waste my phone battery on here just invade I have to talk to someone so yeah.
Once again I'm going through a lot of home stuff to. like with my parents and stuff. So yeah....
I'll talk to you guys soon.
