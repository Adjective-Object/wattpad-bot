" Alex Hale, Layla Redden,  Ally Styx and Lexi Tagget, it is with great adoration to be awarding you all with these PhD's in the studies of biokenetics.  We hope you go out and achieve greatness. " The Dean of the University spoke as she handed us each our own PhD, it was amazing as six years ago I stood outside of the campus knowing full well that I had  a full scholarship that sealed my future  in place and I wondered if I would ever make it here and if I would make a few friends along the way and now here I was standing with my three best friends on stage, being awarded the same title. It was kind of full filling knowing we had gained the title Dr, at the beginning of our names at the meaningless age of just twenty four.I shook the Deans frail hand and smiled at her , as I walked off the stage with the others, towards our parents who had started cheering so loudly it was beginning to become a little deafening.  "Dr. Tagget,  it has a nice ring to it." Mum said as she pulled me in to her motherly embrace and squeezed me tightly in her arms. "It does indeed." I nodded my head in agreement. "Well done girls." Mr and Mrs Redden congratulated us."Thank you." We all beamed at them.The graduation ended and we headed to a gorgeous Italian restaurant in the middle of the city that our parents had booked for this marvellous celebration. We walked into the restaurant and we were directed towards a gorgeous burgundy coloured table that was situated near the handmade fire place.We took our seats and started talking."Okay, so I have a great idea for this Spring Break and we all have to agree we earned it." Alex said as she smirked innocently.  "This, sounds interesting. " Mr Hale directed at his daughter. "Okay, dad just hear me out." She quickly added.  "Okay, I think we are all anxious about this." He jokingly spoke as the table irrupted into laughter."Okay enough with the jokes, I'm being serious.  I think we have earned the vacation to Spain, Ibiza. That is the four of us." Alex spoke being as clear and particular as possible. "Alex who do you think is going to pay for this?" Mr Hale said, looking a little shocked.  "I really thought you could do us all this one favour and pay for us." She said directing her suggestion towards each of our parents. "I think that's a great idea." Mrs Taggert declared as her husband hitched looking distressed beside her."Mum are you sure?" I questioned, trying hard to cover her excitement. "Yes all you girls deserve it." She asserted. "I think so to." Mrs Reddin agreed." I think it's been decided, you are all going to Ibiza." Mr Styx concluded.  The four of us erupted into hysterical emotions as we took in the information that had just been, bestowed upon us.Our food was handed,  to us and the dinner was soon after over.We parted with our family as we headed to our joined apartment.The cessation, allowed us to reflect and plan the trip amongst ourselves. We had decided that Alex,Layla, Ally and I would be leaving in a week from now. The excitation was going to be overwhelming, but it was definitely going to be worth it.  We had planned to go shopping tomorrow, to get all the necessities needed for the vacation, tomorrow. "Aren't you excited? " Layla  questioned me. "I'm ecstatic. " I assured her with a large smile plastered on my face. I thought it would be a great idea to invite the majority of our friends with and they where delighted by the idea."Ibiza, here we come!" Ally hooted and screamed in unison.
