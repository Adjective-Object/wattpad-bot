Through the brick of this dead town, I feel your presence like a ghost. I turn to look behind me, Into the void of darkness, And I don't see anything but your Eyes, each the size of the moon. I reach out to feel you in the summer air. You're real. "Where did you go?" I inquire. "Away" you reply, a smirk on your pale lips. "Why?" You shake your head. But your eyes meet mine, Giving me all the answers. You needed an escape, Somewhere to paint your own sayings on the walls. It's been awhile since you left, And I wonder how long you've come back for. "How long will you be staying?" "I don't know" you whisper. "Why are you here?" I ask. "Because.." you close the space between us, Our lips colliding. All the reasons I waited for your return Come flooding back to me. You'll be gone soon, though. But this is enough; Knowing that while you left society for a bit,You must've thought of me. - (m.m)
