So what's the problem the nurse asked me. My stomach hurt soo bad and I feel so nauseous I tell her. OK let me see if I cud figure out what's the problem. I layed across the bed and lifted my shirt a lul. I'm going to press against your stomach lightly and your going to tell me does it hurt or not. Ok. She began to press my stomach lightly and I began to feel sharp pains. Tell me what do you feel Ayshah the nurse says. I feel sharp pains I tell her. She began pressing again, and I tell her she might wanna stop unless she wants throw up all over her. She stops and hands me a brown paper bag to throw up in. I began throwing up again and I felt like I was getting dizzy. Sweetie you might need to go home the nurse says to me. I called my ma nem and ma said she'll be on her way. You have to go back to class until your mom comes. Alright.
