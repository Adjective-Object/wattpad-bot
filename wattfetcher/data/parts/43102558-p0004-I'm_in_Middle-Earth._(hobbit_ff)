Michelle's POV....
I continued to cry. It hurt for some reason that Thorin called me a thief. I noticed Kili come in the garden followed by Thorin. I remained quiet. Kili left. Thorin looked around for me. He spotted the tree then started to climb. He was close to me. Thorin saw me. He climbed up to my side.
"Listen. I'm sorry for calling you a thief. Fili and Kili told me what actually happened. The book you were wanting to read was my journal. You're pretty good with weapons." Thorin commented.
I remained silent. Thorin staid silent too. The sun was starting to slowly set. I leaned back against something not caring what. The tears stopped falling. I felt something rise and fall. I looked not moving my head to see Thorin. I was leaning against him. I might as well stay still and let this moment last. I sighed. The sun was now gone. The full moon shined now. I leaned forward. The tree wasn't too tall.
I jumped onto another branch. I continued to jump from branch to branch until I reached a branch that was a human's length from the ground. I glanced up to see Thorin watching me in shock and surprise. There was a third expression I didn't recognize. I jumped to the ground and landed on my feet with no harm.
Thorin climbed down. I started to walk to the dining hall guessing that it was about dinnertime. I reached the dining hall quickly. Fili and Kili saved me a seat. A woman dwarf sat across from them. I ran over to the brothers and sat down. I told them about the sunset leaving out the Thorin part.
"Michelle, this is our mother, Dis. Mom this is our friend, Michelle." Fili introduced me to the dwarf woman across from us.
"It's a pleasure to meet you ma'am." I smiled.
"And you dear." Dis replied with a fake smile.
Thorin sat down beside Dis. "Uncle, can Michelle stay in the room across from us?" Kili asked Thorin. I gazed at Thorin. His eyes were filled with mixed emotions. I stood up. Kili gave me a questionable look.
"I need to get some water." I said.
I walked to the kitchen. I grabbed a gauntlet and filled it with water. I drank some of the water and checked my helicopter wound. It looked a little yellow. How is it getting infected? I questioned myself. I sighed then finished the water. I went back to the group. Dis stormed off. I sat down. Thorin had an angry look. He got up and stormed off in another direction.
"What happened?" I asked.
"Uncle told mom that he was going to have Kili and me go on an adventure with him to reclaim Erebor. He mentioned you coming too which made it worse. Mom said that you would cause us to die. Thorin argued with her. Then she stormed off cursing the quest and you." Fili sighed.
"Why does she hate me?"
"You remind her of her older brother who died. She doesn't hate you. She hates uncle. You are like uncle in a way too. He used to act like you until the loss of Erebor, Thror, Thrain, and his brother." Kili added.
"You are leaving tomorrow so let's get you to your room. It is across from ours." Fili smirked.
I followed Fili and Kili to my room for the night. I hugged them both. I went in the room. It was beautiful. I closed the door then went over to the closet. I chose a silk nightgown. I undressed then slipped into the nightgown. I walked over to the bed which was really comfy. I laid down then went to sleep.
