You laugh  while I live, and cry when I die
You remember when I was happy, and laughed when I cried
You frown when I'm dead, yet you laugh at what I said
You always do the opposite of I
I tell the truth, you tell a lie
It's hard for you to smile now a days,
Because I seem to haunt your life always,
I learned a lesson after I died,
Sometimes it's harder to laugh then it is to cry
