This one time-when I was younger- me and my family was at a hotel. We decided to eat  room service and I was in a mood for soup.  There was only one type of soup but in the picture it didn't look good. I told my mom that and she told me "don't judge a book by its cover". I ordered it, it was DISGUSTING!!!!
