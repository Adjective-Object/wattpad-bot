We were so concerned about ourselves that we forgot about the food that I had attempted to cook. I kissed his chin and went to make us plates.
The rest had burnt up because somebody wanted to divert my attention away from the stove... Should be ashamed... trying to ravish me... I thought.
But you responded...My wolf said.
I blushed, remembering. I didn't meet his eyes as I put his plate in front of him.
"Babe?" He asked.
"Hm?"
"Why are you blushing...?"
"Something Lady Wolf said."
He smiled. "About me....?"
"Yes." I stuffed my mouth with food just in case he tried to ask me more questions about it.
I knew he was just as crazy for me as I was for him so I wondered when he was going to mate with me...
He probably will wait until you shift for the first time, otherwise if you mate now I will take over... My wolf said
Take over? I asked.
Yes.
Why?
Because You could shift while you'reÂ  err... you know." Lady Wolf explained.
Oh... I thought.
Yeah. If you shift it you will be better prepared to control me...
I agreed.
I was very curious about his wolf as well.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Later I gathered up the courage to ask him to shift so I could see his wolf. He was very surprised but started stripping off his clothes immediately.
"Anything for you love."
I gasped, blushing and he winked.
When his shirt came off, my mouth went dry.
When those jeans came off, my heart skipped a beat.
When he dropped his briefs to the floor I couldn't help getting excited. He gave me a look that made my insides melt and he kissed me.
"Wrong move..." I whispered against his lips as I rubbed myself again him with a teasing roll. He grabbed my hips, groaning as he hardened.
I pulled away and demanded him to stop trying to jump my bones and shift. He growled at me, causing my panties to grow damp.
"Just remember I get even." He threatened.
I smirked. I wanted him and I was going to get him... now.
I spun on my heel and raced to the bedroom, coming out of my clothes with him right behind me.
When I made it to the top of the steps, I dropped my underwear down there. I was a step away from the bedroom when he caught me... completely naked.
Face to face. Chest to chest. Nose to nose... We were that close and breathing hard.
