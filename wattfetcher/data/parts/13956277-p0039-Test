Suddenly, my nose started to bleed.
"Put her down" Jake said and ran toward me.
"I-I'm sorry I don-don't know what ha" Simon said.
"It's Okay Simon just give me some tissues" I assured him.
"What happened are you Okay" Molly came and the girls followed her.
"You idiot, look what you've done" Damon scolded Simon.
"I- I" Simon stumbled.
"Guys, I'm alright ! Don't worry I'm used to this" I raised my head and pressed on my nose to stop it from bleeding.
"H- here t-take these I'm sorry" He gave me 395 tissues.
"Stop Simon it's Okay I'm used to it. It happens a lot in summer and when I'm angry or stressed, calm down" Simon relaxed a bit but worry was still taking over his face as well as Jake.
"Okay, need some more tissues" He passed me the tissues box and I giggled.
"Back off people I need to get up" I shooed them.
"Come on, I'll drive you home" Simon.
"Someone is caring much" William teased.
"Shut up she almost bledÂ 3 cups because of me" Simon said.
I looked at Damon who mouthed 'Let's go home' and I nodded.
"I'm fine, see you all tomorrow" I smiled then picked up my backpack and walked out the school.
Mission of the month:
Tell father the whole truth.
....

.
I heard a horn behind me.
"Get up" Damon said from the Range Rover.
"No thanks" Aaaaand here we go again, my nose started bleeding again.
"OH SH**" He freaked out.
"Calm down" I laughed while holding my nose.
He jumped out the car "Here you go" He put tissues on my nose.
"Thanks"
"Come on get in, It's too hot here" He opened the door for the seat beside his.
"No" I got in the back seat.
"As you wish" Then he took off.
....
We entered the house.
"It's not stopping" I said.
Mrs.Carter and Elina freaked out.
"What happened" They both asked worriedly.
"It's Okay just because it's hot and I've played basketball"
"She's been bleeding for 20 minutes" Damon said worriedly.
"Just turn the air conditioner on and give me some ice please" Elina ran to the fridge, Mr.Carter turned the air conditioner on and Damon gave me more tissues.
Al hamdulellah, It stopped.
"I'm feeling dizzy" I held my head with my hand.
"Just lay on the couch" Damon said and brought a pillow for me.
"Thank you" I smiled.
"No need, just have some sleep" He said.
