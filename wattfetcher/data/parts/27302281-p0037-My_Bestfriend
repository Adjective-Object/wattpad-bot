I woke expecting to see a sleeping justin beside me so  I looked around and saw  box beside me  so I sat up and opened   the box then removed the white paper and pulled out a card that said
Dear kylie
I have planned a very special evening for us and I would like you to wear this beautiful dress    that I saw you looking at one day and that little shop in town and I thought I would get it for you   hurry I'll be waiting for you  follow the rose pedals at your bedroom floor I will be at the end of  trail can't wait to see you
Love justin
Then pulled out the dress
Its beautiful I though smiling then stripping out my clothes then hopping in the shower then I took a quick shower and hopped out and got ready as fast as I could then looked in the mirror
" you look beautiful honey " my mom said behide me
" thanks mom I gotta go " I said kissing her cheek then following the petals and it led  downstairs   and out the door  I got outside and noticed a sign on the  light pole
Come find me
-justin
I kept following the rose pedals and  stopped at a flower cart  by the park and the guy handed me a piece of paper and a flower but the rose pedals stopped here
Flower for my lady
