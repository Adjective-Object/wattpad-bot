Authors note - Hey I'm Leticia. Also the author. (Duhh) I'm working really hard to fix these first few chapters cuz they are really crappy. But it gets better as chapters go on.
I'm working on miss spelling and random errors. So bare with me if it's really bad. This is my FIRST story. And yeah. I promise the chapters to middle to end, are WAYYY better.
Also I wrote this whole story on my iPhone 4. And it doesn't have bold text, and stuff so I don't have bold text for a/n's.

My name is marissa and I have been getting bullied by my EX bestfriend Hayes Grier.
This started to happen 2 years ago, I never understood why he started bulling me.
I guess the fame got to him
***| Marissa's POV |
I woke up to my clock, I turned it off and put the pillow on my face.
"Ughh another day of that hell hole" I say to myself
I slowly get out of bed and go into the bathroom. i look in the mirror in disgust of myself.
I wash my face and teeth, then go into my room and picked out my clothes. Black sweatpants, a white t-shirt, and white vans.
I went back into the bathroom took a shower and put on my clothes. And blow dried my hair then straightened it.
I went back into my room grabbed my green iPhone 5c, and my lime green backpack and went down stairs.
I have an older sister named Sophie and I live with my dad. My dad is always on business trips and right now he's in London.
My mom had died when I was 5, so my sister is more of a mom to me.
"Hey marissa" Sophie says to me
"Hi soph"
"We need to hurry we only have 30 minutes till school starts"
"Do I have to go to school?" I ask
"Of course you do!"
I sighed and grabbed my backpack and an apple and started my way to the front door.
I have never told my sister or dad that I get bullied I don't want them to worry, they actually think me and hayes are friends still.
We both get into the car. And start driving there.
"Marissa eat your apple." Sophie says
"I'm not hungry" I say I don't eat that much because a lot of girls tell me that I'm fat, and that's why I don't have friends. And I sadly believe them.
~ flashback ~I was in line to get my lunch and these girls start laughing at me, I just ignored them.
I grab my food and start my way to the table, when a girl hits my tray and makes me dump my food all over me."You don't need it anyway, your a fat pig" Olivia says
I was mad/sad but I didnt say anything because she's the most popular girl in school that's dating hayes~ end of flashback ~
We arrived at school and I dont want to get out but I don't want my sister to get suspicious so I just go into the school, and watch my sister leave.
I walk to my locker, and there they were Liv and hayes.
I sighed and the pushed me against the locker, Liv punched me in the face and Hayes kicked me in the stomach about 5 times and than they ran off.
