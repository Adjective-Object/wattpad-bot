My Mum's laughter was a rare.
Almost like a Mammoth, but a little less extinct.
"I miss him so much." She cried.
I just hugged her and we both fell asleep in each other's arms.
I woke the next morning with only 20 minutes until I had to leave.
I rushed up out of the bed and took the quickest shower of my life and then proceeded to brush my wet hair and choose random clothes that were on my floor.
Lucky for me the clothes I chose were not hideous.
Denim jeans and a black shirt with 'Green day' printed along my bust wasn't that bad.
I rushed downstairs and cooked myself a peice of toast.
I ate it as I raced out my front door and ran to the car.
I pulled out of the driveway with 5 minutes until the tardy bell rang.
I parked my car and raced into school.
There was some sort of commotion going on in the main quad, so being the nosy person that I am I decided I would go and have a snoop.
When I got there all I heard was laughter.
I pushed my way through the crowd and was stunned to see one of the smallest most beautiful of girls sitting in the middle of the crowd.
I was also surprised to see Sam and his friend Cyrus pointing at her and making weird fake spasms.
I looked back at the girl and noticed she was crying.
She was doing something odd with her head and her hands.
It looked like she was twitching.
Oh gosh. She has a twitch and my d*ckhead boyfriend is making fun of her!
"What are you doing?" I asked Sam and Cyrus.
"Just making fun of little twitchy over hear" he laughed.
"Well stop! Babe I thought I taught you to always be nice!!" I yelled as I ran over to the tiny girl and picked her up.
I began to walk off with her and the crowd parted like the red sea.
Believe me, I was not nice when I was angry.
