My thoughts are disgusting. Like last nights poison spilling from my stomach, they pollute the area and those surrounding.
I am barely human. More concerned with death than tomorrow's outfit or my career.
I am rotting. Drowning in my own fluids. I cannot breathe a single breath on my own. They were my oxygen.
But hey, everybody knows shit's fucked. And they're waiting for me to die.
