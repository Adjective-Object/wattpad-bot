"No. But only because you are all I see." He said. Samantha blushed. She leaned up and kissed Johnny quickly. She laid her head on his chest and they continued to dance throughout the night. Once the party was over, Johnny was drunk and Samantha had to help him to the elevator.
"Have I told you how much I love you?" Johnny asked as Samantha helped him into the elevator. She laughed.
"That's about the fiftieth time you've said that tonight." She said. Johnny sighed.
"Well then you better fucking believe it babe. Cuz I love you!" Johnny said. Samantha smiled and blushed.
"I love you too Johnny. Now I think it's time for you to go to sleep." She said. They got out on their floor and walked to their room. Samantha went into her suite and left Johnny in the room separating the two suites. She got ready for bed and looked in Johnny 's suite. He was laying on the bed, still in his clothes from the party. "Johnny, change and go to bed. I love you. Sleep well." Samantha said as she gently kissed his cheek. Johnny nodded and sat up.
"Alright alright. Love you too. Night babe." He said as he stood up. Samantha left as he got ready for bed. She got into her own bed and turned off the light. She tried to fall asleep but couldn't. Her mind kept wandering to johnny in the other room. Finally she couldn't take it anymore. She got out of bed and walked over to his room. The light was off and Johnny was in bed. Although it looked like he couldn't sleep either.
"Don't you dare say a word." Samantha said as she got into the bed and curled up next to johnny. He chuckled as he rolled onto his side and placed his arm over her waist.
"Wouldn't dream of it. I love you." Johnny whispered sleepily. Samantha smiled.
"I love you too." She said. Johnny kissed her temple and pulled her back against his front.
"Sweet dreams love." Those were the last words Samantha heard before she fell asleep.
