"Honey, wake up! You don't want to be late for your first day of school." My mom yelled. As soon as I heard her I woke up. I made my way to my bathroom and I hopped in the shower. Afterwards I brushed my teeth. Once I got back to my bedroom I started to get ready. I decided to wear a black skater skirt with a white and black striped crop top, a gold chain necklace, and my black sandals. As soon as I was done getting ready I hurried my way downstairs to go and eat breakfast. After I was done eating my fruit and oatmeal I went to the downstairs bathroom and brushed my teeth again. After I was done with that my mom drove me to school.
