"C'est belle! You're so pretty, Aya!" Sakura and Nami complimented, clasping their hands.
"Its nothing really." Aya answered, rubbing the back of her hair. Aya wore a flowing, knee-length, rose pink with small red roses dotting the edges of the hem. She also wore a backless, halter crop-top that ties into a pink ribbon at the back of her shoulders. She decided to wear her hair in pigtails which were tie in white ribbons and ended at her hip.
"If anything, you look pretty, Nami." Aya complimented giving her a closed eye smile. Nami outfit was a light blue dress that was ruffled with dark blue strings around the dress. Her arm wear is a blue arm glove with pink feathers around it. She has small capris boots with pink and blue feathers. Her hair was done in a ponytail with her bangs facing the left.
"Nonsense, if anything, you look extremely pretty Robin." Nami admitted. Robin wore a (though not meant literally as this was a new style Crimin was trying) purple mermaid skin tank top with a matching translucent miniskirt over black leggings and purple high heeled ankle boots. Robin's hair was let loose.
"Nope, I find that Sakura-kun's outfit is pretty." Robin noted. Sakura's outfit was a magenta sparkling dress with a pink tutu underneath, the skirt has several layers of pink, purple and magenta. Her boots are purple and have blue butterflies on them. That night, with the help of Nami, she pulled her strawberry blonde hair into a French braid which laid on her left shoulder. There a blue butterfly at the end of the braid.
"Would you guys stop it! Let's just go already." Sakura answered with a flushed face.Â  She was not used to wearing dresses far less short ones. This was evident as she tried pulling it down to make it longer.
"No, it will not get longer and besides you loo pretty in it!" Aya chuckled, as she and Sakura walked up the stairs behind Nami and Robin.
"I don't wanna look pretty. I wanna stay inside and read and sleep and do shit like that!" Sakura exclaimed, her face a bit red. Especially after what happened a few hours ago, she was not keen of going anywhere with Hauka's presence.
Soon enough they were on the paved road waiting for a shuttle as the boys came from their room. To be safe, they were all wearing suits with the first two buttons undone but each had different dress shirts.
Ace had a Hawaiian-themed blue dress shirt, Zoro had a white one and Haruka had royal blue dress shirt.
"You ladies look pretty." Ace noted which earned unified 'thank you' from all expect Sakura. She just looked down with her face getting redder. She then ran back to the villa but was stopped halfway by Aya who had grabbed her braid.
"The hell Aya? Let go!" Sakura pouted.
"No. We're enjoying this together." Aya answered sharply. Sakura knew it was pointless to argue and reluctantly stayed.
"You two look pretty." Haruka said to them.
"Shut the fuck up." Sakura answered earning her a slap from Aya. "Since when do you give compliments?"
"Since when are you not excited about anything?"
"I asked you first!"
"I fucking asked you second."
"Geez, these guys never change." Nami sighed along with Aya. Robin just chuckled. The shuttle finally arrived and everyone got in. It was a ten minute ride and they found themselves outside the large dance hall the resort had.
"Ladies first." Zoro gestured, actually sounding polite for once in his life.
"Says the swordsman." Nami responded. Robin just laughed.
