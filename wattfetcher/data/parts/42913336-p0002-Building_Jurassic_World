"Yeah. I'll have to catch the bus to the helipad," Lauren said.
"Why don't you ride with us?" Asked Dale. "We have a 4 door. You can sit in the backseat."
"I have a 4 door. You have a ride... For now." Eddie says to Dale. He Stares at him.
"Really? Thanks so much!" She said. "Now I won't have to take the smelly bus."
"Yeah sure no problem," Eddie says.
"I can't believe we are going to JURASSIC PARK," Dale says, struggling to make conversation. Eddie sighed.
"I know right! It'll be super fun. Real. Live. DINOSAURS." Eddie says.
Eddie had just graduated as a paleontologist 2 months ago. He had been a roommate with Dale, who was studying to be a photographer. After they graduated, the owner of the soon-to-be Jurassic World called Eddie offering him a spot to go with a guest too. Eddie of course chose Dale to go with them. So the 2 stayed roomies for 2 more months until today... Until today when they would go to the park for real.
"Just think... When we come out, we'll be heroes!" Lauren says dramatically. Lauren had been Eddie's bio partner. She had become a paleontologist too.
"IF we come out at all," Dale sighed.
Eddie shrugged. "PLEASE. Almost everybody made it out of the island. John, the kids, Grant, Malcolm... The girl who was dating grant... Ok there were QUITE a few deaths... And of course people were pretty damned up when they got back..."
"Yeah..." Everybody said. Then the waitress came.
"I'll have a biscuit," Dale looked at her. "With 2 honey packets..." He said flirting. The girl looked at him sassily and smirked, flirting with him too.
"Yeah, and I'll have a sausage biscuit..." Eddie glared at Dale.
"Right away, sugar.. What for you, miss? You with this fine gentleman?" She said looking at Dale.
"Um, noo... I'm with this man right here." She put her head on Eddies shoulder. "And I'll have 2 pancakes."
The lady gave Dale a look up and down again and flirty eyes before leaving.
"Jesus man!" Eddie demands. "Do you gotta flirt with every woman we see?" Eddie turned to Lauren. "And when did this happen?" Eddie asked.
"When I felt awkward by being single." Lauren shrugged.
"You don't gotta be single," Dale flirted with her, moving his eyebrows up and down.
"Yeah, let's keep the profile of 'I'm dating him' in this restaurant," Lauren says.
The waitresse came back with Dales biscuit and Dale pulled his chair out. "Thanks," he said, holding the waitresses hips. "I'm Dale... And single." Dale smiles at her. "Can I have your number?"
She smiles hypnotized by his deep flirty voice. She writes down her number on the back of the receipt, before kissing him on the cheek.
"Dear god!" Exclaimed Eddie. "PG!"
Dale bit his lip. "Oh if I wasn't going to Jurassic Park I swear I'd go into the bathroom..."
"Oh yeah?" Asked Lauren.
She slammed Eddie up against the wall and kissed him.
Eddie could feel her saliva as he further enjoyed the moment. She was hot. SMOKING hot... And he would definitely love to do it more with her. But eventually of course it was over and he was disappointed. He yearned for more of her lips.
Dale stared. "What. The. Hell."
