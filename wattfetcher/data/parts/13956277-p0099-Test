We took the sheep out and I washed it, "Can I know why are we about to kill this innocent sheep?" Simon gave the sheep a pathetic look, "Because *pause* because I want to eat some meat, that doesn't involve pork and that's done on the Islamic way" I explained and he nodded like he understood a word although he didn't, "OK, I got this", "No, No, I'll do it, you just hold it for me", "Okay" then he carried it like a baby, "You idiot! Not like this. OK thank you just do nothing and watch" I sighed and he giggled, "First we make sure the knife is sharp enough so it doesn't torture the poor sheep while we swipe it around its nick, is this sharp?" I pointed at his knife, "Yes, I've just bought it from the market, 70 Dollars ! Can you believe it !", "OH please! Like you care about money, I'll pay you back. Now back to our sheep *the sheep makes some noise* yes my little big sheep, we're talking about you, well, we point the head of it towards the Qibla and I say besmillaah Allaho Akbar" Simon nodded, "I'm really getting freaked out because more and more, every day I figure out something more suspicious about you, firstly, you can hold a gun and NOW you're about to eat a sheep, hmm interesting, never seen something like this" We both laughed, "Hold it, 1,2,3 Bismellah Allaho Akbar" and I swiped the knife over the sheep's nick, "I guess I'll be more careful with you from now on" He said and I chuckled, "Shut up, now we wait until most of the blood gets out then we continue cutting and will take the outer skin out, you know how to ?" As I said this word, Simon ran to the bushes and all I could hear was him vomiting, "And I thought you were a tough man ! Shame on you" I gave him a disrespectful look, "Well, excuse me for getting disgusted because I was supposed to be pulling the sheep's hair and getting its laungs and tummy out", "It's a good idea, we should take the heart and some inner things" then he vomited again, "It guess it will be better to take it to someone professional to cut it since you have done what you want, we'll stand and watch as he cleans it and cuts so you make sure it's clean" He suggested, "Fine" Then I turned my face around and saw Damon and his girlfriend beside Mrs.Carter and Elina while the four of them were also vomiting and looking disgusted, I looked at both of my hands which were covered in blood, "I'll wash my hands first then will wrap my sheep and we'll take it to the place we're they cut sheep" I said then walked toward Simon and gave him a romantic before and slowly wiped my hand with his shirt and ran into the house, "LEENA I'M GONNA KILL YOU" I heard him scream but I safely reacher my room and locked the door, "TAKE ONE OF DAMON'S SHIRTS" I shouted back.
"This is actually good" Simon said as I, him, Elina and Mrs.Carter were sitting around the same table and eating the meat had cooked, Damon and Ray weren't here because he had to take her home since she got tired because of my look and fainted, what's wrong with girls nowadays? Too soft, "I'm good at cooking, you don't know me yet" I was smiling then the smile dropped, "What's wrong",  "I forgot something importang" Nina, her sister and the whole orphanage, I was supposed to go there yester day after 5 but then Simon came and I forgot about the whole thing, "What is it?" He asked, "Nothing" He stared at me for seconds before he went back to his plate and ate every bit of it, "Thank you Leena, thanks Mrs.Carter for having us here, now I got to go" Simon left and I was left alone to think of something to do to make it up for Nina's sister. I've cooked a huge meal, it will probably be enough for the whole girls.
I stopped my car in front of the orphanage, waited for 2 hours until the woman left, then I took out the food from the car and knocked, "What are you doing?" I jumped, "You scared me ! What are you doing here" Simon was standing behind me, proud that he scared me, "I knew there was something wrong, so I followed you" He stood tin his place with a stupid smirk on his face, "Leave, I'm fine" I pushed him, "No, I'm not leaving, this place is dangerous", "And how do you know? Just leave I'm Okay" I put the food on the doorstep, "You should leave, every time I come across this place at night I hear screaming and crying, let's go" Simon pulled my hand but I refused to go, "Simon, this is an orphanage, Damon brought me here the first time" I said, "I know it's an orphanage, and that's what scares me, something unusual goes inside" He pulled my hand again, "I'm not leaving, the girls need my help and I promised, I never break a promise, NEVER. Now leave" I knocked on the door, "You're getting us in trouble" He rubbed his face, "What can I say? I'm a trouble maker" I knocked again, "Who is it?" This was Nina's sister's voice, "It's me Leena, open up, I'm sorry I didn't come yesterday" Nina opened the door but shut it slowly when she saw Simon, "Let him go away first" she said, "You heard her" I told Simon, "There's no possible way I'm going to let you in by yourself", "I've been here before, it's not dangerous and nobody is inside, just 15 minutes,  break the door if I'm late, fine ?" I said and he finally agreed.
