I have to admit. I was actually surprise that What My Cutie Mark Is Telling Me made it that. But Sadly Let the Rainbow Remind You won. But actually I like the first place song better anyway. Well I think the next one will be solo songs. So yay more music! Anyway this is it for this chapter. See you in the next one! Keep calm and be a band geek! Flute_player_1 out!
