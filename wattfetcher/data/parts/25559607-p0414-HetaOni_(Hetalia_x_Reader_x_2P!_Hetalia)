The strawberry blonde Brit knelt down and pat the Frenchman's head. He then sat in between Past Allen and Past Matthieu, and wrapped his arms around their shoulders, pulling them into a hug. "I want to stay with these three. Francois might have smoked all the time even if I told him not to, but he was a great friend...and Allen and Matthieu were the two boys that I practically raised.
They weren't perfect, but...they're my boys.
They're my family.
I want to...be with them...until the end."
"Ollie...I am so, so sorry..." Past (Name) cried.
Tears began falling from Past Oliver's baby blue eyes, as well. "There's nothing for you to be sorry about, poppet. You were the sweetest friend I could ever hope for. Sweeter...than my cuppycakes, even. I'm so happy we were able to meet."
And at that, Past Oliver hung his head low, giving his final breath.

Once that memory was over, the scene changed into the piano room. When it became clear where they were, Luciano cringed and squeezed (Name)'s hand. This made the girl look at the Italian. She saw the sullen look on his face, as he was looking at something. (Name) found out what made Luciano act like that.
In the piano room, a blond haired Italian was lying in a pool of blood. It was Past Flavio. Beside him was Past Andres, leaning against the white piano that was now stained crimson red.

"....Oh, hey fratello... This blood red colour brings out my eyes, doesn't it?" the Southern Italian joked, coughing a little.
Past Luciano had done his best to compose himself for the past events, but it seems that he had started to crumble. "N-Not you, too! Damn it all! Why?!" Past Luciano shouted, slamming his fist against the wall.
Not speaking anymore, Past (Name) just quietly sobbed. Past Flavio didn't have the strength to get himself up, but he spoke loud enough for her to hear. "Bella...tears don't suit you...Although...I'm happy those tears are for us..." Chuckling a bit, the blond Italian continued, "You, too...fratello. I may not see it, but I'm also glad you're crying for me."
"Bastard....you weren't...supposed to die...." Past Luciano choked up.
Smiling, Past Flavio replied. "Mi dispiace...Though I wasn't that a great of an older brother to you, I'm glad you still care about me."
"Back then, I thought we weren't capable of having that feeling, but I was able to learn..." Past Luciano said softly.
"You've grown up, fratello. I'm proud." Past Flavio said, closing his eyes.
Seeing this, Past Luciano's heart sank. "Fratello? Fratello?!"
"Luciano...I'm sure that they've all told you this, but I'll say it again. Just go. Leave this place and take the chica with you." Past Andres managed to say. He clutched his bleeding arm, feeling his body grow numb. He, too, met his end.
