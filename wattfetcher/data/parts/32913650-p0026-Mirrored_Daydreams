"What the hell?" Adam asked. "Who?" I asked. "That's the thing... I don't know who." Gavin responded. "How did they almost burn it down?" Shelby asked. "Come on, I'll show you." We all grabbed our milkshakes and got in our cars and drove to the beach house.
We got there and Gavin showed us the little beach, where there was a fire started and it almost lead to the house. "Whoever did this must really hate me..." Gavin murmured to me. I thought of Sabian but I know he wouldn't do anything like this, he knows better than that. We drove back to the dorms and sat at the benches, all of us. "Well, what a day." I said. "Yeah, and I'm extremely tired for some reason." Hannah said. "Do you think Sabian did it?" Shelby asked. "No, he knows better..." I replied. "How do you know?" Gavin replied with a pessimistic tone. "Because I just know." I replied and I wished I hadn't said anything in the first place. "You don't know anything about him!" Gavin yelled. "Gavin, chill." Sam murmured to him. "No!" He yelled back. "Sabian is a harmless being, he would in no way want to hurt you-" "Oh, so now you're sticking up for him and you're on his side?! Why don't you just go DATE him then!?" Then he got up and ran somewhere else. "Gavin!" Sam got up and ran after him. I felt a lump in my throat and got up. "I have homework to do." I walked away from everyone and went to my dorm and laid down. I wanted to punch something and yell at whoever tried burning down Gavin's beach house. I heard a knock on the door and ran to open it.
It was Sabian.
"Hey." He said. "Hey," I responded. "Come in." He came in and sat on my bed. "I just wanna say sorry for the way I acted the other day, I should've respected your relationship with Gavin but I guess I was caught up in the pissiness." I nodded. "You didn't try burning Gavin's beach house down, did you?" I asked out of the blue. "What the hell? Who tried burning down his house?" Sabian asked. "So it wasn't you?" I asked again. "No, I wasn't even near that place." Sabian responded. "Well, he thinks you did it because I rejected you..." I murmured. "Ugh, of course." Sabian whispered. "Well I checked into a hotel room and stayed there and thought about things, I would never do anything like that." He added. "Right? I tried telling him that," I shook my head. "But he didn't believe me." "What's this?" Sabian asked, grabbing the note I had found last night. "I don't know, someone snuck in here while we weren't here and put that on my bed." I responded. "Creepy." Sabian murmured. "I know." "So, is Gavin mad at you for thinking I didn't do it?" Sabian asked. "Yeah, he kinda just said that I should go off and date you." I laughed. "Hah, in my dreams." Sabian murmured. I felt my face get warm remembering that he liked me. "I'm sorry." I whispered. "For what? You didn't do anything." Sabian laughed. "I broke your heart and that's something I'd never thought I'd do," I responded.Â  "It's okay, it's not your fault that I started liking you," Then his eyebrows furrowed. "Wait, yes it is, because you're beautiful and you have a great personality." Sabian said smiling. "Thank you." I smiled back. "Well, I've got studying to do so... I'll catch you later." He started walking out the door when he stopped before he closed the door. "You know there's only one problem with you," He started. "What is it?" I asked. "You're perfect." Then he shut the door. I sat on my bed and laid down, and put on music. I received a text from Sam.
"You okay?"
"Yeah, how's Gavin?" I texted back.
"He'll be okay."
"Okay, I hope so."
Shelby came in our dorm and was telling me what Gavin was saying when her and Sam went to go check up on him.
SHELBY'S P.O.V.
Sam and I walked to Gavin's dorm and he was sitting on his bed. "Hey, what you said to Clarissa was-" Sam started, "Bad, I know," Gavin said, cutting Sam off. "I regret it so much already." He finished. "Well, go apologize dude." Sam replied. "But she's on Sabian's side, and she probably doesn't even want to see my face right now." "You don't even know if Sabian did it for sure." I said to Gavin. "True," Sam replied. "Yeah, you're right, but who else could've done it?" Gavin asked. "Anyone could've done it, don't jump to assumptions." Sam replied. Gavin nodded. "Where's Clarissa?" Gavin asked. "Our dorm." I said. He nodded again, "Well, we're gonna get going, see ya later." Sam said, taking my hand and leaving his dorm. "I guess he's gonna be stubborn about this situation." Sam murmured to me. "I bet Clarissa will too," I said, laughing. "Oh God," Sam replied, laughing too. Sam walked me back to my dorm then I kissed him goodbye. "I love you." I said. "I love you, too." He walked back downstairs to his dorm then I walked into mine and told Clarissa everything about what Gavin said.
