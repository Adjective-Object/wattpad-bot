So today I shall rant about
Attention whores
Yup
We all know a few(All these examples are fake, please do not take offense)
Let's start:
~*~*~*~*
1) they  ignore what you say to talk about themselves
Gosh this one pisses me off the most
Me: so my parents tried to beat me today
Girl: oh my gods my life is horrible my boyfriend said he liked food! AM I  NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM??
Me: ._. Did I just get ignored
Girl: DO YOU FEEL MY PAIN??
Me: *sighs*
2) they are total hypocrites
Person: everyone hates me
Person: other than Bon and Joseph and Bridget and Lexi and
Me: *grabs ear muffs*
3) pretend to be suicidal
Person: I tried to kill myself today
Me: dude, you haven't even gotten out of school
Person: well, like I grabbed a plastic fork and like pressed it against my hand
Me: *facepalm* you poor soul
4) they don't see others problems
Person; oh my gods my life is horrible
Me: did you know every 40 seconds someone dies of suicide?
Person; I bet their lives were great
Me: did you know there are people starving in Africa?
Person: how I wish to be starving
Me; I'm so done
5) THEY ARE SO SENSITIVE
Me: you shouldn't eat that
Person: DONT TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE OMGS IM SO TIRED OF YOU CONTROLLING ME UGH
Me: O.o dude, I'm just saying you shouldn't eat tht metal....
