Teacher:Year Five!Be quiet!Look at Amal(me) reading a book!You all have to get 8A's in your UPKK!You know!

-END-
If I had friends I would be talking to my friends.But the thing is im the only girl in class.Im always lonely.But im one of the smart people in class.There are 9 boys in class.I try to hold my laughter when they make a joke.I hate the fact that I have to study for two exams.UPSR and PSRA.I was so happy that I got 8A's in UPKK last year.But now Im not sure I can get mumtaz(if ya know what that is)in the PSRA.There were two people came to this school.One of them was a bit weird and the other was my classmate in my other school.He got 1st place in class and year.His name is Yusri.He always gets into a fight with Sabrina.They look like siblings because they both were wearing glasses.I'll talk about some stuff that happen at school in other chapters.
