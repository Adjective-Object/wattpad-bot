"You...hear it too, huh?" He asked. I simply nodded.
Japan gave us a puzzled look. "What's the matter?"
"Don't you hear the sound of something...getting... closer?" Prussia asked.
Japan then tried to observe and listen to his surroundings.
"Hey, say...If that thing on your waist isn't just for show, pull it out of its sheath. If you don't want to be eaten, that is. And we've got a frau here to look after." Prussia told Japan.
"Agreed." The Japanese man replied.
The doorknob began clacking. Thank goodness I remembered to lock the door. After a while, there was only silence.
"...Is it gone?" Prussia asked.
"Yes, probably." Japan stated.
"All right. That was a little scary, but now we should join West. Let's find Italy and get out of here as soon as possible!"
"Indeed."
"C'mon, frau. Let's go." Prussia told me.
"Guys... I think you should still prepare yourselves..." I told them.
"What do you mean?" Japan asked.
Before I was able to answer, Prussia already opened the door... to reveal a giant alien-like monster. This seriously scared the shit out of me, even though I expected it.
They then began to fight the monster. I was there behind them.
"Waah!I thought it was gone!!" Prussia shouted.
"Apparently not." Japan said.
"The more I look at it, the scarier it looks!I can't use my awesome techniques like this!Do something!" Prussia said frantically.
Dangit.. Isn't there anything I can do?
I suddenly remember what I did a while back. I waved my hand in front of me and a screen appeared once more. It was the battle scene, only it's in the same graphics as the game. Japan was using his skill, Dismissal. Prussia, on the other hand, was using his Bear the Cross skill. I was also there on the screen, but I had no attack or skills. Though it seems I can use defend and items. While I was checking on the items, the monster hit Japan. I saw that his HP was getting low. Prussia's HP was still okay, but he's already out of MP.
I opened my bag and grabbed an onigiri and beer that was placed there. I then cautiously went beside Japan.
"__-___-chan.. Stand back, you'll get hurt." He instructed me.
"I will, don't worry. But first, you need to eat this." I told him.
"Uh.. Japan, I can't hold up much longer." Prussia said as he was attacking the monster.
"S-Sorry, Prussia. Anyways, _____-chan..I'll eat that later.. As you can see, we're in the middle of something." He told me.
"Nu-uh. You're already feeling weak. Now eat the onigiri already." I told him sternly.
He gave up and ate the rice ball. After that, I checked the menu. His HP recovered by 500.  I smiled to myself.
"Wow. I'm starting to feel strong again. Thank you." Japan said before attacking the monster.
This time, Prussia was blown back by the monster. His HP isn't that low yet, though. I gave him a can of beer.
"Uh. Frau, as much as I love beer, I need to fight that ugly monster. So stay put, okay?" He told me.
