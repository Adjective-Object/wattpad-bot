Okay, what? No, seriously couldn't any book I read end with
"And suddenly she kissed jack, she knew what was right now. She knew that no matter what, no matter the pain, she was going to protect and fix jack. Jack wasn't going to be broken anymore, not on her watch. She now know cam was just a stupid dream, and jack was meant to be."
OMG that is the sappiest thing I have written
Seriously
That's how broken my books have made me.
"Talents"
It's an amazing book
Jacks my bae
But... Like everyone thinks he's evil
Whattttt
Just because he steals cars, is homeless, can be mean, and is part of a gang doesn't mean he is evil
He is misunderstood
MISUNDERSTOOD
I MEAN WHO WOULD NOT DO ALL THAT IF THEIR DAD BEAT THEIR MOM AND THEIR MOM THOUGHT HE WAS A FREAK SO HE HAD TO MOVE TO THE GODAM STREETS
*raises hand*
Pshhhh jack
He's just sad
He kissed the main character
And was rejected
Like
"ALL I NEED IS LOVEEE!"
And
"I came here to have a good time and I'm honestly feeling so attacked right now."
I need jack to say that.
But he's gone now
He escaped
Mother***
Trying to kill jack
Yeah okay sure
You're better off trying to freeze hell
Oh gods
