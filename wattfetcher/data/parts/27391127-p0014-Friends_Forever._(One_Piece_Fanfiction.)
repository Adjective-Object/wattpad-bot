It was a quiet day at Dorm no. 356 at Skypiea. Haruka was reading the newspaper and Aya was trying to make muffins.

"Minna, we got a job request!" Sakura exclaimed sliding into the kitchen.
"What is about?"
"Something happening on Candy Island."

"Oh, you mean Coney Island." Haruka asked looking up from his newspaper. He was wearing his glasses today.
"No Candy Island. They renamed it." Aya mentioned.
"So what's it about?" Sakura asked.
"You're supposed to know!"

"It says help. We need someone to help with coronation of our queen. Is that it?" Aya asked.
"I guess so. That's all it says." Sakura answered.
"Then let's go already. I'm giving you five minutes to pack.

5 Minutes later....

The trio were still waiting patiently at the Train station after buying their tickets to Candy Island.

Sakura was wearing a tight-fitting aquamarine hoodie with a pink flower, long black pants and blue sandals.
Aya was wearing a white vest with a pink leather jack and matching pink skirt with a black belt. She wore pink flats.
Haruka wore a black robe with the left side sleeveless. He also had white pants and black sandals.
"I find this strange."
"Why?"
"They usually assign someone else to work with us. Peferably one of the older students." Aya explained.
"Last time it was Franky. I nearly died." Haruka stated shivering at the very thought.
"But last time it was Hancock."
"That was worse."
Whilst they were remembering their past patners, Sakura noticed the bounties listed along with the names.
"Lightning Demon Haruka: 80 million beli. Glitter Fairy Aya: 50 million beli. Glitter Fairy?"
"The marines made a mistake." Aya answered not being too affected by an incorrect nickname. Sakura looked further and saw her own name with a bounty.
"Sky Maiden Sakura: 60 million beli. What the hell?I haven't even done anything!"

"Oh Sa, I saw your bounty in the newspaper today. It was there because of your previous existence across the border." Haruka stated looking at the shocked girl without any emotion.
"Wait, the World Government controls here too?"
"Yeah, the majority."
"Damn, I can't hide from them."
