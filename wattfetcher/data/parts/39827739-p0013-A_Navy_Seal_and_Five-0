"Hi Steve" he said back.
"I'm not going to be in tomorrow. I'm taking Kylie surfing so she can get her mind off of tonight" I said.
"Is she alright?" Danny asked concern in his voice.
"She's fine but Dona was the man who murdered her dad and I think she just needs to get her mind off of it" I told him.
"If you guys need anything just call. Oh and Grace wants to hang out with Kylie this weekend, without the over protectiveness" Danny said.
"Okay, call me if we get a case" I told Danny and we hung up. Hopefully, Kylie could get her mind off of tonight.
