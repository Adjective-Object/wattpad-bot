I woke up from my nap I was super tired from staying up to do the last of my homework  and looked at the time."Shit"I was invited to Jay Chrislers party he throws the best parties and I was invited to his last day of school party.I ran to my bedroom and took my sweat pants off then my sweater,I walked to my bathroom stripped down and stepped in I washed my body with my pear body wash then my hair with my amazing shampoo, after I got out my hair smelled amazing I wrapped a towel around my body and dried my hair.
I then went and got my dress.It was a beautiful black strapless summer dress that came up to my knees, I know its a little much but I want to impress my crush aka Ryan Dameson the hottest guy in school and the most popular and I want him to notice me.
After I was dressed I walked to my bathroom and got my light gray eye shadow and put a light touch of eyeliner with mascara and dabbed a but of lipgloss on my lips.
I texted my bestie Jasmine to come pick me up,we are going to the party together.....
