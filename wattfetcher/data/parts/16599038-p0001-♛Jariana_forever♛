Justin's POV------
It's been 3 and a 1/2 weeks since Ariana went into coma, and everyone is giving up and making prayers but I'm still going to fight for our love.
I will never give up on Ariana, even if she does hate me and never wants to see me again, but I need to tell her and show her how much I love her.
The doctor took me into another room and he said if Ariana doesn't wake up in 3 days they have to take her off life support!!
I don't know what I would do without Ariana, I love her with all my heart.
I sat next an took her hand and told her "I'm sorry for everything I have done and I'm sorry if I hurt you really bad, I'm going to find who did this to you and hurt them, just please don't leave me yet."
Ariana's POV--------
*dream*
I was in a room recording a song with a guy and when i walked out of the room into another room and saw this guy with Brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, but he was " doing it "
I ran out of the room and I felt like my heart was torn out of me and shredded Into a million pieces.
*end of dream*
I tried as hard as I could to open my eyes and then I woke up next to the same guy I saw in my dream and he was holding my hand asleep on my lap.
I had to figure out who he was and why I am in hospital room??
I just said in a light calm voice" Excuse me"
He opened his eyes and said " ARI, your awake wait here let me call the doctor  but  first," after he said that he leaned In and kissed me and I kissed back surprisingly, because I didn't know who he was, when we kissed I felt fireworks....like we were meant to be.
But I was wondering in my head......who is he??? is he my boyfriend?? And who's Ari???
