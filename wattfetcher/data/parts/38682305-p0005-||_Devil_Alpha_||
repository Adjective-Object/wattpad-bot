I moved out of the water putting my body in a towel I moved towards the door. Bracing my self before I opened the door. "Your mom dropped some things off, there on the bed." His gaze drifted off to my body but quickly made his way back up to my eyes. Then he left. I scoffed closing the door, finishing my Shower.... She left me my phone, shoes, purse, and a note.. Something small just a quick 'I love you, I hope your mate is treating you right!'. If only she knew. . . •••. "Hand me the world on the silver platter, but what would it be without you? "
I walked around the large house just looking around. Not looking for a way out or anything."Who are you?" I turned around to be faced with the girl I first seen here. Her red hair fall over her face and her freckles stood out."Maria." , my words were soft I didn't want her to think I was mean. A smile appeared on her face as she welcomed me in a hug. Awe she's so sweet. She pulled away and gave me a look of confusion. "Why aren't you with the alpha?", she asks. I shrug continuing to walk around, I stopped when I seen a photo. It was of a woman holding a small baby in her hands there was a small boy next to her. A larger older looking man stood protectively next to the family, we'll I'm guessing it was a family. I stepped away looking around I finally noticed I was alone and the door was closed. I looked around, the walls are a peachy color and the large chair was a brown color. An oak wood desk stood in the middle of the room.      "Snooping much, princess?"Well this isn't gonna be good!
