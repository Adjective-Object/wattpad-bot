Now I have a reason
To cut out my heart
To leave not just one, but a thousand ugly scars
Now I have a reason
To no longer care
Now I've lost the meaning of life in this fiery hell
Now I have a reason
To drown myself in tears
I've fall underneath of the brave persons fears
Now I don't have a reason
To die right on this floor
To slam my head right into this door
But fuck reasons
I don't need to have one to fall asleep
To take a bottle of those devil pills and lay down and weep
