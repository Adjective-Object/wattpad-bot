*Zach starring at Amanda constantly**Becky being Zach's cousin**Becky and me getting caught making out*
*End of flashback*
Then it hit me. "I know why!" I shot up and yelled out. "Well why?" Sierra asked. "Well the other day when you guys came over to my house Zach was starring at Amanda constantly, then Becky is Zach's cousin, and me and Becky got caught making out" I said as I was pointing at Marisol and Sydney.
"So what does that have to do with anything?" Quadira asks. "Well maybe Zach was planning for this happen so he could have her all for himself" I said. "That makes sense because, without her this would've never happened because we would've never done it since we have boyfriends that we don't want to loose and Amanda is our best friend" Quadira said.
"Exactly! So one of you needs to go find Becky and talk to her because I kicked her out" I sort of shouted. "Ok so we'll go find Becky and talk to her because then we all will figure out if we're right or wrong" Sydney said. "Ok that's great, go find her now" I said to them. So they all got up to look for Becky. "I'm gonna get my Princess back one way or another" I whispered to myself.
