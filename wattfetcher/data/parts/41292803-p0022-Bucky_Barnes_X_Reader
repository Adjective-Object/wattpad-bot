As I was screaming I felt the ground beneath me move. I felt something shaking me. Suddenly, my eyes flew open. I stood up fast. Too fast. The world spun and I felt myself falling. Someone caught me and restrained my flailing arms. I felt my fists hit something but I couldn't control myself. My breath was coming out in shallow rasping. I still was regaining control of my mind.
My arms were held firmly and after struggling for a short while I stopped. I looked around and slowly began regaining awareness. I realized where I was. I looked down at the hands that held my wrist gently yet firmly. One was silver. In that moment, relief was so sudden I nearly passed out. My muscles relaxed and I was held limply in Bucky's arms. I closed my eyes but I couldn't stop thinking about the dream. I shuddered. Tears trickled down my cheeks. I remembered falling asleep in Bucky's arms.
What happened?
You had a bad dream. You had fallen asleep and I did too. Then you started screaming and I jerked awake. You stood up and then stumbled about until you began falling. I caught you and you flailed. Are you ok? What happened? Why were you screaming?
Oh Bucky. I said burying my face in his t shirt.   You and I were running and he pointed a gun at me and you took the bullet for me and died. And I couldn't stop it. Oh I hate it here. DO you hear me Hydra! I hate you and your brutality! OH Bucky. I can't lose you! I can't! I can't! Oh! If they take you away I swear I will kill them! Oh Bucky. I sobbed. Clinging to the front of his shirt.
We were standing and I buried my face in his shirt. His arms encircled my waist and he rested his chin on the top of my head. He swayed back and forth. I felt myself calm. I sunk to the ground and he went with me. He sat up against the wall. I sat in his lap and leaned up against his chest. His fingers ran through my hair making me feel safe and protected.
Don't leave Bucky. I whispered as my eyes closed. I drifted into sweet sleep.
