Facing the left hall, Past Italy put on a fake smile and called out, "Veee, Germanyyy! I'm coming with you after all!"



Running down the left hall, Past Italy met up with Past Germany.


"Whoa! Wh-what now?! Are you back to normal?" Past Germany asked, looking confused.


Past Italy stuck out his his tongue and laughed. "Ehehe! I was always normal! Anyway, let's look for Prussia with Japan! Come on~" he said, pulling the German's sleeve.


"Wait-let go of me! Stop clinging to me!! Fine, I get it! You're scared of being alone-"



"Haha, you saw right through me! Russia and China are on the first floor, so let's help on the second floor."


"Good grief..."

-=-=-=-

When the coast was clear, the Italy and Germany of the current timeloop walked down the hall.

"Wh-What the heck? Why are we over there?" Germany asked, shocked by what he just saw.


Italy thought for a moment on the possible explanations. Then, he snapped his fingers. "...I see! So this is one of those past memories we're supposed to get when we break a clock!"


"Oh...that thing Japan told us about? But wait, how come I'm seeing it, too? I mean, we didn't even break a clock!" Germany reasoned.


Seeing Germany's point, Italy nodded. "Mm...I-I see. Then what on Earth...?"

Suddenly, Past England walked down the hall and saw the two.


"What, you're here, too?" the Brit asked, tilting his head.


Italy turned around in surprise. "E-Eng-wait, what?! You can see us?!"

"I beg your pardon? I have no idea what you're talking about. I just heard your voices and came back...By the way, I didn't see the monster you told us about." Past England told them.


When it all dawned to him, Italy only muttered, Â "Oh..."
