my foot twitched as i hosted my head with my right hand...i let my hand fall down to the computer to help me type more better and faster as i let out a yawn.i went to yawn again but started coughing so much that a single tear brimmed my eye.i whipped it away as i let out another yawn..and another...and another.	i heard a noise outside and became curious as i wondered"is it raining outside?"i went to look if it was just the wind and found out it looked like it HAD been raining already.'...huh..and when did i miss this?'i thought awkwardly to myself but kept a plain face.yawning once more i thought.'maybe a short nap couldnt hurt..right?'i put the computer aside and covered myself up with a short furry wolf blanket wincing in pain again from my ankle.i chuckled once when i looked outside to see it brightening up.i shook my head feeling fed up with my body and turned up some music drifting asleep..or so i wanted and wished,but apparently,the world doesnt work that way..i got interupted by mother screaming,"BRY,KRIS,FOOD!"i winced when she said kris but shook it off.it wasnt going to change or anything.rubbing my neck i forced myself to go downstairs.
