Without getting up from the bed, I rolled to the other side to get hold of my phone. Unlocking it, the screen displayed a text message:


=-=-=
From: /Luciano/
To: /Name/

Ragazza, we need to talk.
=-=-=




"What?" I gasped in confusion.


Lifting my blanket a bit, I looked at the 1Ps to see if they heard me. They didn't. Well, considering that we were in a quite a distance from me, they couldn't have. That...and it seems like they were also having a discussion of their own. Probably about what finding a way out or something, or maybe even about all the world meetings that they've probably missed already. Either way, it's not really my business, so it'd be best for me not to pry.


Because my business happens to be something else.


Hiding under the covers again, I frowned. "What do they want from me now?" I wondered.


"...Well, there's no harm in replying, I guess..." I muttered to myself as I typed out a reply.


=-=-=
To: /Luciano/
From:/Name/


Talk about what, Luciano?
=-=-=



A few seconds after I sent the text, I received a short reply:



=-=-=
From: /Luciano/
To:/Name/


About you.
=-=-=



I felt my face heat up a bit upon reading his reply. What did he mean by that?? I shook my head a bit to recollect myself. Okay...I have no idea where he's going with this.
