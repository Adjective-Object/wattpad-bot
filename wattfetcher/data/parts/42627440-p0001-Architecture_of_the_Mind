Here is a collection of my poetry, these range from old poems from a long time ago to poetry that I've worked on recently.Poetry is an escape for me, its a way to express myself without being painfully blunt and fully exposing these toiled feelings I have. It's typically highly emotional for me, but sometimes it is lighter. I can be fairly dark, so I apologize in advance for any triggers that might come up in the words you may or may not read.
In these pieces you can see thoughts dedicated to love, pain, confusion. I have struggled with an eating disorder that I've kept to myself as well as serious body issue problems. I've been hospitalized for many medical reasons that I cannot help due to genetic disorders. I've been through a lot of good things and bad, and I think you can really see that in these pieces. But with these experiences comes serious reflection along with raw emotion, so I apologize if these bring up painful memories for you.
That's why I'm putting a trigger warning on this because I want to share my upset with others so they may learn from it and know that they are not alone here. However the last intention I have with this collection is to upset anyone or cause a relapse.
So I welcome you to the intricate crown molding of my mind, my poetry.
