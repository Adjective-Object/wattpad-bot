"I can join you." He seriously needed to leave me alone. And I know him, he doesn't take no for an answer.
"Okay. You know where I live. Meet me there in an hour." I headed the opposite direction of where he was going.
"Oh yeah, bring your running shoes and running clothes. And like a water bottle or two. This is going to be fun." I said with a smile. This boy had no idea how long my run was.
"Okay we'll meet you in an hour." He nodded disappearing in the crowd of cars in the parking lot.
As I shut the door of the car my sister looked at me raising her eyebrows.
"What?" I said raising an eyebrow at her, too. She looked away.
"Oh nothing." She turned the key to start the car. "Just that I'm wondering what your boyfriend wanted." She said with a smirk on her face.
I couldn't help but blush. I covered my face with my hands so she wouldn't see.
"His is not my boyfriend. He is Zeke the one I told you about." I lifted my hand of my face. I saw the smile drop off her face.
She was the first one I opened up to about it. And well I loved her because she was also the first to hear me out. She shook her head. "I'm sorry, what did that asswipe want?" I sighed.
"He wanted to 'hangout' and I said yes."
"Why would you say yes?" She rolled her eyes. I just shrugged.
"I really don't know. But he said that he wanted to be my friend. Since you know we have grown far apart cuz of her."
"Okay. Whatever." We stayed quiet for the rest of the way back home.
