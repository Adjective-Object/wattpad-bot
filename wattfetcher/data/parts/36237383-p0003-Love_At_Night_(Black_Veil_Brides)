As once a term was used that if the heart was to beat too fast it would break. Well if i had one it would of broken. Ashley was like no other vampire. He understood me. I quickly turned to face him.
"But if it became between a werewolf falling in love with the woman you loved....would your outlook be somewhat different?" I asked. I didnt know why I did but it was just an answer I needed to know. He chuckled softly.
"I would battle it for the one I loved and may the victor keep be with one they loved." He turned back. I approached him carefully.
"Do you think I haven't had this run in before?" He asked and slowly raised his shirt. His chest has three large scars and a hole. I glided my hands over the scars.
"I lost on purpose so that the werewolf can find happiness in this world." He said back gently. I found myself slowly falling for him. A powerful vampire like him could easily win but he lost on purpose? Was it mainly he thought his love deserved more or did he long for the same thing I longed for.
"Would you lose again?" I asked. He didnt smile, didnt even chuckle. He started to rub my stomach lightly with his knuckles.
"Depends on the person." He replied softly. I looked to the horizon and saw the sun. I sighed ever so softly and broke away.
"I must leave but shall I see you again sir?" I asked.
"You shall." He replied. I hurried off towards my home with a contagious smile.
