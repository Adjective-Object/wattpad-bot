Why on earth would you fall for someone's looks?
When you can fall in love with their mind instead?
It's like that quote about the books;
And how you shouldn't judge them by their front covers.
We may we partners in crime but you don't seem like a crook.
You're the thunder, I'm the lightning
And it's like an earthquake shook
Everything in my world
And some thief took
My heart
And maybe if I'd have had a second look
I wouldn't have overlooked you and your bad intentions.

Tell me how you feel about this. I personally know I've done better but..
