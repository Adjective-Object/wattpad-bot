Fine." I growled. I don't know why but something about that sparked anger. I told her everything, but she couldn't even tell me why she was going to break my heart. Something inside me felt hallow, like I didn't care anymore."I don't need you around anyways. You're unless."
She looked up at me, still calm. "Zach, really, I'm sorry-"
I cut her off. "Honestly, Cheri, I don't care. It's probably a good thing. You are so freaking clingy and stupid it was getting on my nerves. You are like a charity case actually." It was a complete lie but I was so angry at her.
"I'm sorry Zach." She wasn't crying but her voice had wavered slightly.
"Just go away. And don't bother coming back."
Cheri stared at me for a second, a hurt look in her eyes. But for once, it didn't bother me. Thanks to my anger.
"Bye Zach..." She looked at me a second longer before hurrying away and out of my sight quickly.
I don't even know what just happened. Angriness just exploded inside me. It didn't even seem like something I would do. Usually I would just try to reason with her. But I didn't even try.
I sat down on a near by rock, feeling hollow. Then I looked out to the little river and saw the big rock. The rock Cheri first kissed me on.
I couldn't help but feeling like it was now the first place and the last place I would kiss her.
