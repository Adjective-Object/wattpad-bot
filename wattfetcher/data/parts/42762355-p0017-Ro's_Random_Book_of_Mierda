Let's list things about a certain person that I don't understand and who I sometimes very much dislike.
1. Please, form sentences that are clear. I don't understand it if you replace words with random emojis.
2. I know you're always fucking pissed off, but don't curse it out at me.
3. Don't tell me what to do with my life, since we both know I have things in hand better than you do.
4. Stop acting like I'm stupid.
5. Stop being such a typical teenager.
6. Stop being so awkward about everything.
7. Stop pretending that my opinions don't matter to you, because most of the time you are acting like you have a huge crush on me.
8. Calm down once in a while.
9. Take care of yourself and things will work out better.
10. Stop copying me at everything, you look pathetic.
11. Stop wondering why people don't like you and try to make friends.
12. Do something with your life. I can't be your Sun.
13. You don't know me, so don't act like you do.
14. You dress up like an junkie ready to give a blowjob for couple euros. I just needed to say that--
15. You don't need to pretend that you agree with everything when it comes to me. I don't mind opinions. I'm not fucking insane.
16. Focus on important things, please. Your life matters.
17. When I compare you to a tired preschool pupil, I really can't find that many differences.
18. You always complain and whine, but when I say something like "Oh, it's raining outside..." you shout at me and tell me to stop complaining. What the shit..?
19. In the end, you don't have that much on me. Watch your words and behave, because you don't really want me to hate you, darling.
20. And put the goddamn phone away even once.
