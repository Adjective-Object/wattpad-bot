So my mom always tells us where we're going 30 minutes before hand. So me and me Bros always have to get ready quickly. It takes us all at least an hour to get ready. Because we always have to take showers (there's three of us),which means that we have to take turns. Today my mom was wanting to go to the city next to us, which has a Papa John's. And while I was writing this she said I'll just go to the town we live in. And in my head I said, but Papa John's pizza is the pizza. The very best pizza. We were actually going to go on errands, and I have no idea how we're going to do half of them because we live in a small town.
