Can I just say I don't like them??
Like at all?
I mean it's okay when your writing a story or doing an essay but it's so GODAMN annoying when someone is correcting your spelling while your texting!
"IM NOT DOING AN ESSAY FOR A TEACHER I CAN SPELL HOW I WANT!!!" That's me when someone is correcting my spelling.
But in reality I just say,"I'm sorry..." Very shyly because I'm a completely different person in real life XD.
AGHH MY GRAMMAR SUCKS BUT I DONT CARE CUZ YOLO.
I'm sorry but I realized I like ranting xD
Ranting is fun...
Like dolphins....
And books...
And anime...
Speaking of anime!
Does anyone recommend any anime? I have like four animes I need to finish but they aren't catching my interest...
