It was uncertainty. She was afraid. We were almost there and she seemed more afraid now than she ever did.
I started up the steep, dusty hole. I was probably halfway up when I heard a thud and a yelp.
What if Sterling was in trouble? Had she been too afraid to come up?
It was not nearly as difficult coming down the snake hole than up. Once the dust was out of my face, I noticed Sterling, standing in place. She looked pale. Rigid stiff.
And she was crying.
Now, there was banging on the storage room door. The man had made it through.
"Come on, we have to go," I whispered, stretching a hand out from the top of the mound of wooden boxes.
And for what it seemed like the longest while ever, all she did was stare at me. The rim of her eyes were watery but she was no longer crying. She didn't even seem scared anymore.
She just seemed... lost. Confused. Bewildered.
"Sterling?"
All of a sudden, she blinked. Sterling grabbed my outstretched hand and climbed to the top of the mountain of crates with me.
"You go first," I offered, guessing that she had been scared of being the last to go. Perhaps to be left behind.
Somewhere between her nod, I might've heard her say, "Thank you."
