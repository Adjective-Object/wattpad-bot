Jadyn's POV

It is 5:00 am. I have to help out at breakfast. I try to be quiet so I won't wake up Veronica. As I walk down stairs I hear Sister Margereta on the phone. She is talking to someone. Since we live in Essex England it is hard to find a truly caring family. It is the middle of June and only one girl has been adopted. Every one who comes in leaves for another orphanage. I hope VV (Veronica) find people who want both of us because we are sisters and we will probably never seperate.


Veronica's POV

Jadyn was trying to not wake me up as usual.  At breakfast we heard the adoption bell. Then Jadyn and mine names were called. When we got in Sister Margaret's office we both froze.
