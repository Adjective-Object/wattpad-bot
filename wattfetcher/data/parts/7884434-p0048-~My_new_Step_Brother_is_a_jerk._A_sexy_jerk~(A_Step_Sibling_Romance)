"G-God Shea you feel so good" He says through a moan, as he starts to thrust a little faster.
Im unable to speak.
The pleasure I'm experiencing, sending me to such a place that I never want it to end.
I feel his body pressed against mine, and his member inside of me.
People describe sex as something thats so great and you'll always want it, and how your first time is going to be so special if you make it that way.
This is not sex...
And I can tell its not..
His slow motions and how he holds me, how he feels against me and inside of me. The way our body just move together in a beautiful and perfect sync.
This isn't sex
Its making love.
He gets faster, and my moans get louder with each one of his thrusts.
He doesn't get to fast, but its at a pace that is so perfect that it doesn't need to change.
I kiss him, moaning and breathing heavily into his mouth, him doing the same.
"God Seth I love you" I moan into his mouth.
He holds onto me tightly and picks up his pace, it being still so passionate.
"God Shea I love you too!" He moans out loudly.
And thats when I feel it.
Everything.
My body trembles and shakes and it hits me like a ton of bricks.
I moan out loudly for him and cling to him, his body doing the same as mine, his thrusts slowing down and getting slightly sloppy but still passionate as we both reach our climaxes.
He comes to a stop, and he kisses me, not pulling out. Our breathing is so heavy, and our bodies covered slightly in sweat. I hold him close to me as we kiss, our lips and bodies fitting perfectly together like puzzle pieces.
