I know what you are probably thinking; this is a typical human falls in love with undead creature, but I assure you that that is not the case. In fact, I find it the exact opposite at times. My life turned into a comedy ever since he showed up.
"Hey, Sarah, you're out of pudding," Mathew said as he walked in, a spoon full of pudding in his mouth, "and I think I broke the chair in the kitchen. Hey, are you listening? What are you doing?"
Yep, that's Mathew Bondwin, the demon that has vowed to haunt me for an eternity. Let's get on with our story before I pull out the holy water.
"Sarah, are you ignoring me?" He poked my cheek.
"Here is twenty dollars! Go crazy!" I yelled, slamming two ten dollar bills in his hand.
"But I don't even know how to use this!"
"Get ready to go to the store then."
"Can I drive?"
"Hell no."
Like I said, he is going to haunt me for an eternity.
