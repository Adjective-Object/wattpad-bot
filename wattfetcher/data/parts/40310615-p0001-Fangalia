The 4 witches and wizard minor gods walked into the clearing. Rowena wearing blue, Helga wearing yellow, Salazar wearing green, and Godric wearing red. They changed into cats with pelts resembled their robes. The cats met in the middle and touched muzzles. All of a sudden in the sky, the Greek sky people collided with Silverpelt creating a blinding light. But the cats looked on. Olympians and cats together came down from the night sky descending into the clearing. Zues came down with a lightning bolt. Hera followed then Poseidon, Hades, Ares, Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes and others. The cats came down after. BlueStar, CrookedStar, and SpottedLeaf led the group followed by other StarClan warriors. The four cats stood up and became humans and greeted the newcomers. "You want to create a school for witches, Wizards, minor gods, and cats?" Zues said, his voice booming in the still summer night.
"You will accept everyone peacefully?" SpottedLeaf asked.
The four magical folk nodded. "Then I hereby give you my granting." Said Zues. "Our children, born with magic and the power to change into a cat will attend this school under the blessings of the gods and StarClan. Is that a yes?"
All people from the heavens nodded. One by one people and cats alike stepped up to give the four people blessings. Once done the heavenly people said their goodbyes and left as quickly as they had come. Rowena Ravenclaw sighed. Their school, Fangalia, was now a reality.------------------------------------------------So I know I keep starting books but I promise I will finish this one!!
