"Jake please Stop I love you" that only made him kiss Riley more and cause me to cry even harder till I was hyperventilating. Then I turned to Riley "your my best friend please Stop it she didn't even Stop kissing him she just rolled her eyes while doing so. I turned to Lucas he reached out his arms for a hug I didn't want to hug him because this was his fault but it was my fault too. I ran to him he stoked my hair and told me everything would be okay. "You really know How to calm a girl down don't you" "yeah I do". "Lucas i really like you will you be my boyfriend?" "Yes" he said. "You can come over to my house tonight" "of course".
