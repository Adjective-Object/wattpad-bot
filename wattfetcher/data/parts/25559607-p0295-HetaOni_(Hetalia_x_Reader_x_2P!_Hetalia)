"You...You...you did die." Past Germany said, thinking he knew it was the only explanation for that.

Italy suddenly forgot his rage and sighed. "...Yes."

"I see...I'm sorry..." Past Germany apologised.

Raising an eyebrow, Italy asked, "What...?"

"I'm pathetic...I couldn't even...let you rest in peace." Past Germany resented, burying his face with his hands.


Italy took a step back. "Wait, what? Does he think I'm a ghost? ...Oh, but this could work in my favour... he thought. Clearing his throat, he got the attention of the man in front of him.  "G-Germany...I just wanted to...um...protect everyone..."

"--I promised." Germany said, looking at Italy eye-to-eye.

Italy tilted his head. "Hm?"

"Beds for everyone. a large table. A kitchen...and...what else?" Past Germany asked.


Italy didn't know what to say. "Oh...well..."

"It'll take some time, but I want you to wait. I'll definitely keep my promise to our friends." Past Germany reassured him.


Italy smiled and saluted with his left hand. "Ve! It's a promise!"

"Huh, idiot...you have your right hand...And I ended up falling behind...I'm sorry, but I have to join the others. They'll get worried..." Past Germany told him.


Italy nodded. "Yeah, I'll be fine. I can go back."

"I see...I'm sorry I made you worry. I'm all right now." Past Germany smiled. A sad, but genuine smile.

Past Germany starts to walk out of the room. Just before he exited the room, Italy spoke
,
"I know...Goodbye, Germany."
