So after I realized it was pretty late and I needed to get home Chase drove into the infield and Anna and Ryan met us next to my car. Anna was holding Ryan's hand and she had this panicked look on her face. So I quickly got out of Chase's car and walked over to Anna. "It's going to be fine, my mom won't get mad. We just have to hurry home."Chase parked his car and walked over to me and pulled me away from Anna for a second. "Taylor," his eyes were dark with concern, "I love you, be careful. I want you to drive safely. Be careful, it's really dark out now and there isn't any street lights on your way home. I know you're tired so I can't say this enough; please babe, be careful. Watch or for deer and other animals that will jump out at you. Watch out for stupid drivers. Please call me or at least text me when you get he safely. And if your mom is mad, I'll take all the blame. She can even call my mom and have my mom agree that you weren't at fault for being late." I gave his a small smile through my stressed look that I knew was across my face. I couldn't help but smile a little bit at how much me cares for me. I hugged him, "Thank you, for everything and don't worry, I'll call you." I gave him a kiss. Not too long but enough to say what I was thinking with out having to say it. I pulled away from the kiss and walked to my car and got in and before I shut my door I said to him, "I love you.""I love you more princess, please be careful."Anna hopped into the passenger side, for she had a similar conversation with Ryan and we were off on our hour and a half ride home.
