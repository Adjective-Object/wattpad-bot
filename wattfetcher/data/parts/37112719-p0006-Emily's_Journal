"I missed you too Syd. How was school today?"
"It was good!" Sydney smiles proudly, "We learned about sharing."
"Nice! How has Kaden been?" I set her back down.
"He's good, I think."
I knock once on Kaden's door.
"Come in," I hear his young voice through the wood. Kaden's sitting at his desk, concentrating intently.
"How are you doing Kade?" I keep my voice soft. I set Sydney down. She leaves the room.
"I'm alright. Tough English though. I'm never going to pursue anything in it. Why must I continue in the class."
"Well, I don't know about you, but I want to be literate."
Kaden laughs, "Yeah, I suppose I do too."
"I'll see you for dinner, Kade. Call if you need help."
"I will," He responds, not taking his eyes off his paper.
Sydney's waiting for me outside the door. She holds a Barbie doll in each hand.
"Carter!" She yelps, "Do you want to play?"
"I can't now, Syd. It's dinner time. You can help me though."
I hold Sydney's hand in my own as we trek to the kitchen.

That night, as I help my mother put away groceries, I tell her about Emily March.
She doesn't say anything.
She only holds me close in her warm, loving embrace.
