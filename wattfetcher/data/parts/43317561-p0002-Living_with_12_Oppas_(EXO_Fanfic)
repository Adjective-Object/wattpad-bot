-SM'S DANCE STUDIO-Park Chanyeol's POV
"Good job guys." Suho hyung cheerfully praised everyone. I smiled back in return and went to go get some water. Dance practice was now much more frequent and much more exhausting. Don't get me wrong, I really can't wait for EXO's debut at the end of this year and that I want everything to be perfect, but sometimes I can't do anything but wish for some rest."Yah, Chanyeol." Someone snapped. I look up to see the idiot I have for a best friend standing in front of me."What do you want, Baekhyun?" I gulp the water from my water bottle."Dance seonsaengnim said that we can leave early today. Are you coming?" I nodded in response and picked up my bag. Finally, I can have that long awaited rest. I sighed in relief and ran to the other EXO members, falling a bit behind them.
-AT THE DORM-We entered the dorm to find it surprisingly clean."Did SM hire a maid?" Kyungsoo walked around the now free-to-roam around living room."Finally. I can have space to move around in." Suho sighed happily."You were able to move around before." Sehun mumbled."That's because that huge mess was your's and Kai's." Baekhyun flicked Sehun's forehead, causing the maknae to pout cutely (Ew.)"That wasn't mess, that was organised chaos, right Kai? Kai?" Sehun looked at Kai for back up, but the dancer's mind seemed to be somewhere else."What's that smell?" He said dazedly. Suddenly, an aroma started to fill the air."Is someone cooking?" Baekhyun sniffed. One by one, each of us made our way to the kitchen to find a short girl cooking ramyun."Excuse me." I spoke up, causing the girl to jump. "What are you doing in our dorm?" I said in a slightly angry tone."Chanyeol, calm down." Suho tried to calm me down."Why would I calm down?!? There's a stranger cooking ramyun in our home!""Umm..." The girl spoke up. "I live here..." And that's when I realised, I wasn't gonna get my well deserved rest.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Long time no see! So, it is 28th June, meaning it is my birthday! And as a celebration, I'm giving you a brand new fanfic. I know ES, YMOM and CMAAWLOM aren't done, but I'm gonna be putting my focus on this story so I could actually have a complete fic. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it and it won't be crap like my other stories. Anyways, I'll see you in the next update!~Zoe â™¥
