Anson bobbed his head, "Good thought. I didn't really take into account the air quality of Morrowind, I had forgotten about the Red Mountain entirely in fact."
Katya cocked her head, "What is that?" she asked, feeling ignorant. Anson had taught her to read and write her letters, counting and adding were things her mother had showed her many years ago but reading was something that Katya delighted in. She loved the written story and would read most anything she could get her hands on, whether it be published works or journals and letters written by the bandits she had been hired to kill. The Red Mountain was something she had heard of in passing but hadn't ever expanded on.
"The Red Mountain is the tallest volcano in all of Tamriel. In the Third Era 5 it erupted, blanketing Morrowind in ash and debris and killing a lot of Mer. A lot of Mer were forced to become refugees, some of them running here to Cyrodil, many others to Skyrim. From what I've heard there are a lot of them living in Eastmarch? But I suspect that they won't give you trouble like the ones in Loxias's house, after all they're in Skyrim, no one gives a Nord trouble in her homeland."
Katya let out a bark of laughter, "Yeah right Anson. If that were true then there would be no insurrection and the Thalmor and the Imperials would not be invading my country."
"True. I guess what I meant to say was; No one in their right mind, would mess with a Nord in her country. Not if they knew what was good for them."
"Aye." Katya nodded, "One day the streets of every city will run red with the blood of my people's enemies. They'll come to rue the day that they thought they could enslave us."
"I'm sure that they will. I'd like to be part of that; after all, it isn't just your people whom the Thalmor have tried to destroy. Remember Valenwood and all of the clan houses that were completely obliterated simply so that the Altmer could keep the blood pure."
"They will pay for their crimes Anson." A bitter anger was in Katya's voice now, "They will pay with their lives. When we have driven them from Skyrim the fight will come to them. I'm sure of it. Ulfiric is not stupid enough to believe that they will leave us alone after we've thrown off their bonds. They will come to us, or we will come to them."
"I agree." Anson replied quietly. And then they were silent, both lost to thoughts of fire and war, Anson in his memories and Katya in her fantasies.
4EYear 1941st Heartfire
Morrowind was as inhospitable as they had both figured it would be and neither of them slept well as they traveled across the burnt land. There was too much to worry about; Reavers for one; Dunmer bandits who roamed the land virtually unheeded; and then there were the Cliff-Racers, nasty little reptilians with wings, they bit and spat fire like tiny dragons and many nights the two travelers feasted on the sulfur-y meat. It really didn't taste all that bad. And then there were the native elves, all of who suspected the two of them of having ill intentions. Katya was beginning to hate Mer more and more by the day and it got to the point where they skirted settlements entirely, only going into villages to refill their skins at the public well.
Despite all of these complications they were making good progress, halfway to Skyrim in little over three weeks in fact. Katya would fall asleep nights, with visions of snowy mountains and 'frozen vales in her minds eye. She began to ache like never before to feel an icy breeze on her cheek, to taste the sweet, dusky air of the pine forests again. They were so close to their destination. And then came the guar farm.
