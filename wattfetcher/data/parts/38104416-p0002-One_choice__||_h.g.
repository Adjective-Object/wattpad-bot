"OK well think hard"Ethan said
"Shut up I'm thinking " I said as I smacked his head
"Omg she always talked about how she always wanted to go to Paris and spend her time there to see the new years" I told Ethan
"Omg thank you so much Frida , I own you big time " Ethan told me
"No problem talk to me if you need anything OK " I said
He nodded
"Shook now go go" I said pushing him out my room
"Feeling the love in here " Ethan said laughing
" oh my Lana is lucky to have someone like him" I said to my self
** I woke up and  went down stairs I found a note saying Lana had left and Hayes would take me to the big room
"Goodmorning" Hayes said
I nodded like a gangster
"Where's Ethan and Lana " Hayes asked
"They left to Paris "
"Was that today" Hayes asked . I nodded
"Lana said you would take me to the big room on the left wing to show me stuff" I told Hayes
"Yes its a room like the hunger games except without peeta and katniss "
"Danger I like peeta" I said pouting
" I'm here to ya know" Hayes said
I rled my eyes. Stuber freak
" watever let's go to the big room so if an show you stuff" Hayes said as I followed
** We walked into a room full of weapons like knives and guns and backpacks with supplies and weapons and to the end a large screen with a counrtry Map and cameras around the house
" Hayes this is kinda fre-" I got cut off
Someone put a nashty smelling cloth over my face.
Shitface I know that Chinese or japenese shit called karate.
I grabbed his balls and then his arms and pulled it to his back and up to his neck
"Who are you and who do you work for" I said
They didn't fucking answer .
" I said who the fuck do you work for you shitface" I said a little louder
"I don't want to hurt you"
I let go and pulled the mask off
"Hayes why would you do this " I asked
" I kept track of you since highschool when lana and Ethan started dating " hayes said
He walked to the screen and my school records from Preschool though highschool.
Every record from doctors to police from trips to getting high
I grabbed the gun front he wall and another one onto the back of my pants.
"Why did keep track who do you work for " I asked
" my self , I always wanted you to be mine " hayes said as he walked twords me
I pointed the gun tworda his chest. He put his hand on the end and took it away.
" your with me now , I always loomed at you like something precious" hayes said as he traced his fingers across my face
