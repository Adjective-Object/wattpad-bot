The smoke was rising upwards.
Drifting toward the heavens.
I couldn't help but watch as it did.
I took a long drag of the cigarette.
Another puff of smoke rising.
I wish I could become that puff of toxins.
I wish I could drift aimlessly toward the sky.
I wish that I could forget her.
I wish I could.
I really wish I could.
I wish she would just get out of my brain.
I wish upon that damn puff of smoke.
I wish that I can just find myself and lose her in the process.
How can you lose something you are sure you found?
How can you lose something when it was what found you?
How?
