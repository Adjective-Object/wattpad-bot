Leilani smiled as she finished up with her cilent. She loved her job and was blessed for the opportunity that she had been given. At the age of twenty four, she was a successful business woman and liked to think that she was one of the lucky ones. Leilani was the youngest of six children and her father was a former Dallas Cowboys player. She had been to the Olympics when she was fourteen and took gold in Gymnastics, but was forced to quit due to an injury that damaged most of her left side.
"See you next time Mrs. Langston," Leilani waved as she closed the door to her office.
Her phone rung and she picked up on the second ring.
"Hello?"
"Lei Lei hey girl."
She smiled into the phone as she heard her best friends voice.
"Girl where in the hell are you?"
"In San Jose with my boo," she said.
Leilani could hear the smile in her voice.
"Are you talking about that football dude?"
"Yes, his sexy ass OMG."
Leilani rolled her eyes.
"So what made you call me?"
"Attitude I see, maybe you need someone to knock the dust off that pussy and you'd feel better."
Leilani was about to give a smart remark, but her assistant knocked on her door.
"Your next appointment is here."
"I have to go, talk to you later."
"Whatever you say," Tasha sighed.

Tasha walked down to Colin's kitchen and looked for something to eat. She had been sleeping with Colin for about a year now and she was content with their relationship. She knew that she wasn't the only one that was under him most of the time, but she was the only constant one and she knew that had to do with the fact that she didn't pressure him into trying to make her his main. His attitude though, was a different situation. If you didn't bow down and kiss his ass, he would dead you right then and there. Tasha sighed as she thought about it. Hopefully Colin would make a change for the better.

"So what is this about huh?"
Jed shot Colin a disapproving look and shook his head.
"These headlines have to stop Colin," Jed said throwing the paper in Colin's direction.
Colin Kaepernick has a Major Attitude problem and the 49ers still baby him, the headline read.
Colin sucked his teeth.
"These people are just haters, I'm not worried about them."
"But you should be, because if you don't get your act together and I mean soon, you're fired."
Colin looked at Jed like he had lost his mind.
"I'm the best damn thing that happened to this organization."
"See that's the attitude that I'm talking about Colin. You have one of two choices, either go to Dallas and have Bradley Vaughn mentor you, or lose your job. And I'm not really giving you much of a choice, you're going."
Colin huffed out his disapproval and walked out of the office. He had to go home and pack.
