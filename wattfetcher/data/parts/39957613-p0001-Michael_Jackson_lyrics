My life has taken me beyond the planets and the starsAnd you're the only one that could take me this far I'll be forever searching for your love
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day) You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day) You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day) How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
At night pray before I sleep in hope of finding you I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love
