Shea's P.O.V (play the song)
Kisses
Thats all I feel.
They relax me but awake me. I can feel Seth's lips traveling up and down my neck and I can feel his hand gently holding my face.
"B-Baby" I whisper as I slowly open my eyes, looking and seeing his handsome face.
"Hey beautiful" He whispers looking down at me. I blush deeply.
"What do you think you're doing Mr!?" I say with a giggle.
His head leans down and nuzzles into the crook of my neck. "You just looked so beautiful in your sleep... I couldn't help myself" He whispers, his hot breath fanning against my neck and I blush, my hand running into his hair.
He gently kisses my neck and my eyes shut. I slowly run my hands down his chest and I arch my back, my chest pressing against his slightly.
I feel his hands grab my curvy hips, his thumb caressing my soft milky skin underneath my t-shirt.
I moan as he gently nips at the sweet spot on my neck. My hands run down his muscular tan back, my nails slightly running along his skin.
"Fuck Shea" He moans in my ear. I blush and kiss him passionately, my lips moving against his like they fit so perfectly together. I wrap my legs around his waist and I pull his bottom half against mine.
Our lips are moving so hungrily against each others but at the same time so passionate.
My breathing is so heavy and his hands are running all over my body, his touch feeling so hot against my skin.
He grabs the hem of my shirt gently with his large hands and I sit up a bit for him. He looks in my eyes as he pulls my shirt up and off, and as he throws it to the floor I lay back down and he captures his lips with mine.
Memories of the other night flash through my mind and I cover my exposed chest. I didn't have a bra on so I felt more exposed and open to him.
"Its okay baby.." He whispers against my lips. "Im not gonna hurt you" His hand gently holds my face and his lips are just slightly hovered over mine.
I let my hands drop and his free hand softly runs over the top half of my body. My back arches into his hand and I watch how his eyes shift from lust to such passion. He leans down slowly and starts placing little kisses on my chest. I watch him and gently run my hand through his silky soft hair.
I bite my lip as his lips travel slowly down my chest. He looks up at me for approval and I nod slowly, his lips feeling like such fire on my skin, making the rest of me crave his delicate touch.
I watch as his mouth wraps around my n^pple, and gently sucks on it. "O-Ohh Seth" I softly moan with a deep blush, throwing my head back.
His other hand gently plays with my other n^pple and he gently tugs on it, earning me a soft moan.
My breathing is so heavy and soft little moans for him continue to escape my parted plump lips.
My back arches on instinct as his lips travel down my stomach.
His hands grab at my pants and slowly start to pull them down, his lips just continuously leaving me breathless.
