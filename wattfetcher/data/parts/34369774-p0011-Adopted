I walked downstairs to see....THE PIZZA GUY!!!!! I wish. The last person on earth that I wanted to see.
"Hello." I stared at them.
"Well, aren't you gonna introduce us." The boys said looking confused.
"She doesn't talk," They laughed, "That's funny. You seemed to be able to talk a few years ago. A little too much. Don't you think?"
-Flashback Age 13- Walking down these halls were always scary. There's always this group of girls who are always terrorizing me. And it really hurts.
As I'm walking I feel myself get pushed into the locker and fall to the floor. I look up and it's them. "Aw well look at that, it's little Lisa Brown." The leader of the group said as she kicked me.
"What the hell do you want?" I asked starting to stand up.
Then the leader grabbed my shirt pulled me close to her face and said,
"Did I give you permission to talk to me?"
Then she threw me against the lockers ever harder then gestured her minions towards me. Then I'm kicked several times before I start to feel light headed. Then when the girls stop kicking me the leader kneels in front of me pushes my bloody hair out of my face and whispers to me,
"Get to class."
Then as she stands up I fall unconscious not knowing if they ever got in trouble for what they did.
-Reality-
I didn't even realize it but I was crying. It was all to much. The girls who used to hurt me were in front of my face. As the tears fell down my face the girls laughed making me feel light headed. Finally before I knew it I saw a light and fell on the floor. That was all I remembered.
