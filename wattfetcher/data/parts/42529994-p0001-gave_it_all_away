as i wake up i loved my dream about carter james i remember his cute hazel eyes from the orentation parent night the other day and how we danced the night away in my dream. Im full of ego. well i go to my bathroom shower condition and shampoo my hair with my new conditioner and shampoo that smells like kiwi and strawberrys and scrub my body with vanilla bean noel from bath&body works with my flower scrub then i go brush my teeth for about 2 minutes then i put on my new high wasted skirt pare it with a lace turquoise greenish crop top and hot wedges then i curl my hair and do my makeup then eat my eggs and strawberry juice as i scroll through instagram and twitter.
