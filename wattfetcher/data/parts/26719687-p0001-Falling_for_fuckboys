Hi guys, I'm destiny. And I'm not the brightest kid, I don't behave in school, and I never listen to my parents. I mean most kids say that "my parents don't get me" but, my parents honestly don't. How can two people who were REALLY popular in highschool possibly understand what is like to be me, I mean they both have black hair and blue eyes, my brother and my sister are both attractive, they're blonde hair and blue eyes, so why am I stuck in this family, I have red hair, like dark red, that resembles well, blood. As for my eyes, I'm the only one in my family with brown eyes, well I've been told they change but, I don't see it doing that. So, now you know about my family life.
