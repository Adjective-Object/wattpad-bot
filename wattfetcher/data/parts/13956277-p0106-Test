Simon's POV:
My blood was boiling, the only thing that stopped me from beating Damon to death is that Leena was between my arms, I held her so tight that I felt her heart beat, I knew I was not supposed to do it, but I had no words to say, sometimes they say actions speak louder than words.
Leena pulled away and looked right through my eyes, "I'm going to pack my bags, call the airport and see when is the next fright to Jordan" Leema sniffed then walked to her room, as soon as I heard her door shut, I gave Damon a deadly glare and caught the hem of his shirt, "Are you crazy ? What's wrong with you ! Your childish action ruined everything" I said angrily, Damon pushed my hand away, "I knew her first, I had the right to be with her, not you", "Says the player"I provoked him and gained a punch right in the face, "STOP IT" Elina shouted, "Are you going to ruin your friendship for a girl? You know each other since you were 6" She scolded us, "Screw you Damon" I punched him, "YOU ALWAYS WANTED WHAT I HAVE" He punched me back and we started beating each other, "SHE WAS NEVER YOURS, SHE'S WAY MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE NEEDY GIRLS YOU KNOW" Elima screamed out loud and tried to seperate us but what can a skinny girl do to seperate to muscular guys?
"I don't have time to lecture you two" Leena brought her bags down, her eyes were red, so was her whole face, "Simon, I need a ride, and for you Damon, it's not over, and I will be back because we have a long conversation to go through" Her look made my heart ache, I've never seen her as weak as this, she's always the fighter, "I'll be back in an hour" I got out and jumped into my car and headed to my house.
"Hey honey, Dinner is almost ready" Mom kissed my cheek, "I'm leaving for few days, maybe weeks" I took my shoes off, my mother laughed, I'm serious mother" shock was obvious on her face, "Why ! You've got everything, why are you leaving us" Her eyes got teary, "I'll be back, I have to go with her" I ran to my room and mom followed me, "Who's her ? The one that burnt you? Right?"Mom caught my hand and stopped me from pulling a bag, "Yes, her. For the first time, I feel different about a girl, she needs me" I opened the bag, "And did she say she needs you?" Mom raised an eyebrow, "She didn't, but I need to stay beside her" I put some clothes in the bag without even folding them, "You two are different, there's no chance for you two to get together, LOOK AT ME WHILE I'M TALKING TO YOU" She caught my shoulder, "Mom, she's my friend, please, I'll explaim everything later, I'll call you everyday" I put everything I needed then zipped the bag, "What's going on?" Molly came, "Talk to your twin ! He's going to leave with your Muslim friend" Mom said, "What ! Why is she leaving? Why are you going?" Molly asked worriedly, "Call Elina and she'll explain everything, I have to go now. Mom, I'm sorry, I'll be back soon. If I get late, follow me, her country has many great places for tourists" I kissed Mom's forehead, "Take care, take some money" I hugged her one last time, " Thank you, I got my credit card" I took my bag and walked down to the living room and opened my laptop, I booked two tickets, the flight was in 3 hours, so we were supposed to go right now.
I stopped in front of the Carter's house and pressed the horn 3 times, but Damon got out instead of Leena, I sighed as he reached me window, "Take care of her" He said, "Don't need your advice, keep yourself busy with your fake girlfriend an-", "I'm ready" Leena came and cut me off, I got down and opened the back door for her, I knew she won't sit beside me for an hour in a car, but, surprisingly, she threw her bag in the back seat then shut it and got in the front seat, "Let's go, I can't stand him" She was still crying, I turned the car on while Damon was glaring at us with envy flooding from his eyes.
"So, when is the next flight?" She pulled another tissue and wiped her face, "Almost in 2 hours" I kept my eyes on the road but her sobs made it really hard for me to concentrate, "I can pay for a ticket when I arrive to the airport right ?", "First of all, there's no I, it's WE, and WE have already paid for a ticket online" I smiled, "What? How? Why?" She sniffed again, "I paid for our tickets online, I got your full name and bought you and myself a ticket", "WHAT ! NOW ! YOU CAN'T COME WITH ME ! YOU DON'T KNOW MY FAMILY, THEY'LL KILL YOU IF THEY SEE YOU WITH ME" She sobbed, "There's no better way to die than dying for you" I smiled, Leena slapped me hard, "STOP BEING NICE AND ROMANTIC, I'M SERIOUS" I tried my best not to chuckle, "I won't let you go alone, I'll think of something" The rest of the road we stayed silent.
