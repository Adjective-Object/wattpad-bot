I drove and glanced at tash. She was in deep thought " you okay?" I asked.  She looked at me and gave me a small smile "yea. I'm fine babe ." I nodded 1...2...3... "Its just that...what if they don't like me!" I laughed and looked at her " seriously? That's  what your thinking so hard about?" She nodded and poked her bottom lip out " I'm just scared okay? This makes me nervous. " I parked in my parents drive way " well....suck it up because we're here now. " I got out and waited for her. She took a deep breath and slowly got out.  I grabbed her hand and walked to my parents door knocking on it. My mom opened up and smiled hugging me I smiled and hugged her back " hey mom."
