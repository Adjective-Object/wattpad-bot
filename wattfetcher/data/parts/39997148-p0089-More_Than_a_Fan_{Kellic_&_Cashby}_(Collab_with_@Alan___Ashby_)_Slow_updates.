"Yeah I guess that's one plus side."
"Exactly now lets get back to the buses."
"Alright." He said and took my hand.
"Thanks for hanging out with me this morning."
"What are boyfriends for?"
"Oh all kinds of things." I said smirking at him and winking.
"Austin..." He said letting my hand go.
"What?" I asked, "It's true." I told him and grabbed his hand once again.
"I don't like you."
"Yes you do don't lie."
"No, I don't. Not anymore."
"Liar, liar pants on fire." I sang.
"I'm not lying." He muttered letting my hand go again.
"Baby!" I whined, "Don't be like that."
"I'll be how I want."
"Alan." I whined, "Why?"
"Because I can."
"I don't like you anymore." I mumbled crossing my arms.
"Good."
"Just remember this when you want something." I said just as we got back to the bus.
"Don't be like that meany head."
"I'll be how I want." I said mimicking what he had said earlier.
"Fine then." He said and opened the bus door getting on and walking to his bunk.
"Butt head!" I called after him and went to the lounge and sat down.  It was quiet on the bus, which was weird because the guys were always here talking or playing video games. They must be out.
"Oh my god! Austin!" Alan screamed running to the lounge and jumping on me.
"What?!"  I asked catching him just in time.
"There is a spider in our bunk."
I laughed, "Really? A spider? Why didn't you just kill it?"
"Yes its a spider. I can't kill it. You do it."
"It's a poor innocent creature I'm not killing it." I said and put my boyfriend down. "I need a cup."
"No. Kill it!" He pouted, "Please?! I want it gone."
"Kill it? Babe it's not doing anything to you it's just living it's life."
"Well it's gross. Now will you get rid of it."
"Will you get me a cup?"
"No because you're going to kill the little monster."
"Baby I'm not killing it. I'm gonna put him outside."
"Fine just go get rid of it."
"Nope."
"Austin! Why not?"
"Because remember? When you ask for something I'm not gonna do it."
"Austin!" He whined, "Kill it please?"
"No." I said sitting back down next to him.
"You're mean to me."
"I guess you could call it that."
"Why won't you just go kill the damn spider? Please!"
