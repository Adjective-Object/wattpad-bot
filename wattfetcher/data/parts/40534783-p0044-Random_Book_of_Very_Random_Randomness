So, this is a spoiler on "into the stars" by my other count 10th_Doctor_ . It is how Arya and the doctor get separated. DO NOT READ IF YOU DINT LUKE SPOILERS.You have been warned.
The dalek had its fun to my back, pressed painfully against my spin. The doctor showed up on a hologram. I looked at him, pain swelling in my eyes. The daleks were about to throw me into a crack in the universe. Into a parallel universe. The doctor...he couldn't save me this time. I swerved my eyes shut, allowing a year to fall. I let in a slowly, shaky sob."Arya Nicole."I opened my eyes and looked at the hologram."You get for minutes for your goodbyes" said the dalek."I-I'm sorry..." I said trough a shaky sob"This isn't your fault. I should t have left you on your own like that" he smiled weakly. My face was growing red with the on coming years."I-" my voice caught in my throat painfully."I-..." I looked him in the eyes, my vision blurry with tears."I-i love you.." I sobbed."I love you too." He smiled. I couldn't help but smiled softly. "Goodbye...don't forget me.""Never." The daleks opened the portal. I was sucked through. "Don't forget me, Doctor! Find me!" I yelled as I was sucked away. Never..to see my sweet doctor again.
Please, so from there I would make my second book. OMG that's sad, XD
