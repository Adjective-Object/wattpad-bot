My back hits the wall and I move my head to see Luke. He pulls me up again and pushes my body on the bed, I've never felt this way before. So helpless, like I didn't deserve to get up from this.He licked around my neck and my wolf purred, And I  couldn't help but moan.  But then I stopped.Tears filled my eyes.He marked me.    •••I shivered and Luke put a blanket over me. I hate him.I hate him.I hate him.    'No you don't', my wolf groaned. I still don't know how she could still love him although he beat me!! Every time he would try to wrap his arms Around I'd slap his arm away, and he would simply growl..When my mom told me about the whole 'mating' and 'marking' thing she told me it was the most important thing ever! It was supposed to be romantic and special! But Luke ruined that. He did more than ruin that.He broke me. ...  WHOSE POV SHOULD BE NEXT?!?
