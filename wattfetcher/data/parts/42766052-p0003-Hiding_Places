I lifted my eyes hearing a voice whisper "I hate you."in a way suggesting that anything they ever said before was a lie.The voice laughed as the guy who received the message looked struck.He looked taken aback.I turned to see who the voice belonged to.She was sauntering over to me.She had pitch black hair and ice blue eyes.Her eyes looked like someone chipped off a glacier and stuck it in her eye sockets.They were cold yet had a certain humor to them.I adjusted the hipster frame glasses I had on.(Yes they are prescription)My brown eyes widening as she came closer to me.I wanted to sink into the lockers.My claustrophobia was kicking in and I didn't want her any nearer.
"Idiot he was thinking I actually liked him.Right?Idiot.He freaking called me a hore the first time we met.Right?"she said laughing.I backed up into the locker trying to melt into it.
"C-can you n-not get so.. c-close?"I stuttered out clutching at my books.Something glinted in her eyes quickly but then she went back to her usual face.
"What are you scared of?"she said slowly and gracefully coming closer to me like a cat.I let out a small scream then ran. I am just stupid.I'm just stupid.I'm stupid for being scared of her.I could hear her feet behind me as I ran laughter in her throat.
Your laughter sounded so innocent.
You sounded so innocent.
I couldn't possibly know you were evil on the inside.
The others didn't either.
They hate you now.
I'm stupid though.
I still love you.
I still do.
Gosh I'm an idiot.
I'm so fucking stupid.
You aren't innocent at all.
