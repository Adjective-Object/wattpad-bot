"And with no further ado, Bella and Sky" Mark our other captain cheers. The curtains open and Bella gets in her starting position while I sit and pick up my acoustic guitar.
"I remember when we where young
We spent all day having fun
When the leaves of fall fell to us
We'd catch the old bus
To a town away from everything
Honestly now that sounds a bit boring
But I was with you, so I didn't bother me
Oh but how we've grown
Now we dream of a life as simple as that
I still welcome you, right by my front door mat
Baby girl I love you more than the stars in the sky
Oh how I love you, I know people call us strange but baby I still love you
I can't look at you without you making my head spin
I think you melted my heart made of tin
All my walls came tumbling down
And so did my frown
All the darkness from above slowly fell away
It was so good I though I'd have to pay
If i close my eyes I can see
You right here beside me
I fell in love with your heart
Your my missing part
Oh how I love you, I know people call us strange but baby I still love you
I can't look at you without you making my head spin
I think you melted my heart made of tin
Baby girl your my one and only
Baby you keep me strong
If you ever felt like leaving
I wouldn't cope, I need your love
You keep me alive
You loved me back to life
No ugly past to remember
Only our memories
I'm happy to wake up with you on my mind
Oh how I love you, I know people call us strange but baby I still love you
I can't look at you without you making my head spin
I think you melted my heart made of tin"

"I guess they will contact you soon, Bell don't worry" I reassure Bella
"I guess, so who are we meeting with?" She asks me
"My cousin, Scott, and one of his mates apparently" I reply
With a nod we continue to walk down the beach path where we are supposed to meet up.
Bella is wearing a very nice black bikini set, it shows of her perfect figure and creamy skin. Whereas I am in a Navy blue sports crop top and light blue swim shorts.
"One, two, three, four, five, and six" Bella says playfully poking my slightly emerging abs from my new training.
