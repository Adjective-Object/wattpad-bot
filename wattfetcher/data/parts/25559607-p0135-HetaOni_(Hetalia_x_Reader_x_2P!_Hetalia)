Luciano clicked his tongue. "You're an airhead, again, ragazza. Siiii. Of course, it's fucking important. Why do you think I'd have you take that from them?!"

Upon realising this, I started to shake my head. "No...then....Then that means I'll... That means I'll have to betray them...?"

"Si. That's exactly what it means."

I looked away. What should I do? If I accept Luciano's offer...I'd be able to go check on the First Players and maybe even help them out...and keep my parents safe at the same time....but at the same time.....I'd be taking part in Luciano's plan for the downfall of the First Players. That metal piece might even turn out to be one of those items necessary to leave the mansion... But...if I don't accept....what? I'll just stay at that unknown room without doing anything at all? .....I can't do that either.

How am I supposed to deal with this?

This wasn't part of the original game at all. Not knowing what the possible consequences are to the next steps I'll take...makes me feel so...vulnerable.

I don't have a checkpoint. I can't save before making a decision. I can't restart this game or reload this game.


....Because this isn't a game.


This isn't the game I thought I knew. This is for real. This is my reality.


And as it is to me and to many...



....reality is scary.


"........But.....they'll get mad at me for taking away something that could've been of use them....They'll get mad....at me...." I stated, my eyes starting to water.

Luciano turned around, not facing me, and spoke darkly. "Si. But that is no longer my problem, ragazza."

Should I?

Should I not?

What is the answer?

If I decide now...I'll probably regret this later on...


...but it's just like how it usually is when we make decisions, right?


So....?


".......So, ragazza? Will you accept or will you not? Time is ticking away."
