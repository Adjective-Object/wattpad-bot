"He said "Pretty girl, you're faking smiles.I wonder if you'd see me right.I don't mean no harm,but if it hurts, why don't you try?"
I said "Pretty boy, you're not that smart.You wouldn't want me to depend on thatI have many things I'd like to sayand many things I'd like to do.But I recomend you, not to come.This road might be better taking off alone.""
