My name is Kara Banes and I am 16 years old. I live with my father, and I believe in fairies. I have always believed in fairies. Because I know they exist. They come to me, in my dreams, and they speak to me. My mother was a fairy. A beautiful one, I've seen photos. My mother's name is Bubblegum. My father is human, he just couldn't resist Bubblegum's beauty. And they made me. However, my mother is not supposed to interact with the humans, and as punishment my mother was killed, and I was cursed, my lifeline is a stick of bubblegum, and if anybody does anything to the gum I will feel it, if they chew it then I am dead. I am Bubblegum Girl.
