"Hahaha very funny now come on!" She said as she pulled me up and took me to the dance floor/ living room.
When we got to the living room Uptown funk by Bruno Mars was on. Iris started dancing instantly. Iris is one of the closest friends I have. She has beautiful blonde hair with sparkling greenish gray eyes that are almost always filled with energy. She is so optimistic while I am kinda pessimistic about most things. I love Iris like the sister I never had since I am the only child and a orphan I can not have a biological sister.
I felt a warm hand on my shoulder as Uptown funk ended. I turned around. It was Hayden. Just then Thinking out loud by Ed Sheeran came on.
"May I have this dance with you?" He asked.
"Sure." I said breathlessly.
He pulled me closer to him and he put his one hand on my hip and held my hand. I placed one hand on his shoulder and held his hand with my other. I smiled up at him as we started rotating in circles. He was about two or three inches taller than me.
"So how did you know I was here and-" I said but he interrupted
"You know Esmee Bailey right?" He asked I nodded. "She's my half sister and her boyfriend Brendan Danielson is my best friend so Brendan and Esmee thought it would be a good idea for me to come with them here because its my last night in town."
"Yeah... same here..." I said sadly "were do you live?"
"New York state" he said.
"Oh my God! I'm moving there tomorrow!" I said excitedly.
"Oh my goodness! We are gonna live in the same place!" I said enthusiastically.
"Me and my family live on a ranch." He said.
"Ooh so your a country boy huh." I said he laughed.
"Yeah I guess so." He said.
By then we had already danced through four songs but we didn't care we were having too much fun to care or even notice. I wished that we could dance all night long but we have school tomorrow and as soon as the party ended, we'll say our last goodbyes to the house and start our new lives in New York state.
