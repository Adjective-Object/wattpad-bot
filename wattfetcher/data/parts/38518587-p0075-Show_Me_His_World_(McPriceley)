"Brooklyn used to do that." Kevin said sadly. This was the first time he'd mentioned her since last night.
"Why did you two break up?"
"She left me for another man."
"Is she crazy?"
Kevin furrowed his brow and blinked. "What?"
"She just left you? Is this new guy made of gold and chocolate? Seriously what's the logic behind that?"
Kevin wondered why Connor felt so offended by Brooklyn leaving him.
"I mean, sure you've got issues, but you're like a dream guy for some people."
"Connor, really it's okay." Suddenly Kevin felt the need to comfort Connor over his breakup.
Connor calmed down and continued playing with Kevin's hair quietly. After half an hour of silence, paired with the rhythmic movements of Connor's hand in his hair, Kevin drifted off to sleep.
He dreamed about going to Florida, a dream he had often. Florida was Kevin's favorite place in the whole world. When he was a child he would beg his parents every summer to take him to The Sunshine State after a school friend had described it to him.
When he turned nine, Kevin's mother and father took him and his siblings to Florida for his birthday. To this day, Kevin remembered every detail of the trip.
A change of light in the room woke Kevin up.
He opened his eyes and found himself alone on the couch. Across the room, Connor had turned off the light and was slipping into his coat. "Connor." Kevin said, looking at the shadow.
"Yeah?"
"Stay."
Connor didn't reply, but a few moments later he scooted onto the couch next to Kevin, warming his body immediately. One thing that Kevin found absolutely intriguing about the redhead was the fact that he radiated warmth like a human furnace, it certainly wasn't natural but Kevin certainly didn't mind.
Kevin wrapped an arm around Connor's side and rested his head next to the other man's. He smelled the peach shampoo that Connor used and smiled before drifting back off to sleep.
