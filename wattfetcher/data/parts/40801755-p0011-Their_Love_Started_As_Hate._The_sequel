The most important thing Is to enjoy your life-be happy-It's all that matters.- Audrey Hepburn ____________________
This is an extra one because I liked it it's not really a quote though. ðŸ˜‹
Men hate to cry, they rarely ever do. but when a man cries over you, I can guarantee he loves you. because men only cry when they lose something or afraid of losing something that they love as much or more than themselves.

"Great you's met," my aunt Jen butted in, "no, he isn't staying with us, it isn't him, no, I refuse for it to be him," "be nice, Emily what's wrong?" "Him, he was the one that cheated on me," I shouted pointing at him, Jen went quite almost as if she was speechless,
"I didn't cheat on you," mark said sounding angrier "look he has no where to stay, he used to come with his mum and dad but, he died remember of cancer, and his mum refused to come again because it was there family thing?" This is new information,
Come to think of it me and mark knew nothing about each other, I didn't even know his dad died, I let out a sigh, "fine," I shrugged and folded my arms then walked off.
I got the key of the office person for our hotel room, number 690, wow 69 so funny, can you hear the sarcasm?
I opened the door with Mark and aunt Jen behind me, "well," Jen said looking over my shoulder, "how's this going to work out?" Mark asked, I huffed, "well you can't sleep in a bed with my aunt Jen," "are you that stupid?" He rolled his eyes and I crossed my arms, "I'm not sleeping in a bed with him," I said to my aunt Jen, "not what you where saying last night," my mouth dropped and I turned to slap the face of him,
My aunt Jen had her eyebrows raised curiously and probably shocked, "I can't believe you," I shook my head glaring at him, he smirked and hit my shoulder walking into the room, he makes me so angry, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 I counted slowly, he will not make me blow, I'll be fine, ugh.
"Okay I'll ask for another room," "Emily sweetie just for one night, you done it last night, God knows how you even went to his house in the first place," mark smirked a mischievous look in his eye "she was at th-" "I needed to finish a project with him and I fell asleep," she nodded, "and why was he in the bed?" "I, i,-" "she was cold," Mark interrupted that was the only bit I didn't remember o blacked out then I hate alcohol so much,
"No funny business," I pointed at him and raised my eyebrows, he chuckled and got up of the bed he was lying on, "so Barry's?" he asked I looked down at my shoes no way I was walking about portrush with these on, "yeah, Harley wants to go on the cars," my aunt Jen grabbed Harley's hand and the pram Xander was in and walked out,
"I can't walk about in these," "we'll change them I'll wait on you for goddess sake," I unzipped my suitcase and grabbed my white converse, and a air of ankle socks, "ready," I nodded and he helped me up of the ground, it's cold in here, tingles ran up and down my arm, "are you okay?" He smirked knowing how he affects me, "yeah," I grabbed the key out of the pocket thing on the wall that activates the lights and we walked out,
He shit the door and we walked down the steps, that's when I realise I'm still holding his hand, I let go and my hand quickly fell to my side, Mark looked at me from the corner of his eye he was smirking, I felt my cheeks heat up,
We walked along the pathway in an awkward silence well for me it was awkward, my aunt Jen was no where to be seen and I was getting uncomfortable the path was small so we were to close for my liking, are arms or hands would brush against each other occasionally, we got to Barry's and skaters, screams and the smell of food was amazing, just like being at a fair but at a theme park,
