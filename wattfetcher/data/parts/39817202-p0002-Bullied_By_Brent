The teacher gave me the blank sheet of paper.Now I have no clue what to do. I was just sitting there for about what felt like five minutes when the teacher called on me.

"Mrs. Brooke, you have been sitting there for ten minutes" Oops.. " are you even planning on doing it. I can make our lives easier if I just give you the zero now." she said while the class stared at me.

" I'm doing it, I have to think first." I replied hoping she will believe.

" I didn't know that you had to think about what you did over the break." The class laughed while I just figured out that we had to write about our week off. I ignored everyone and just started writing.

In the middle of it, I felt someone playing with my hair, but I ignored it. The bell rang and I stood up to give my paper in. I suddenly fell back down. I turned around to see my long hair tied to the back of my chair. I untied it and walked away, while everyone is laughing their heads off. I am thankful that I can deal with my embarrassment right now or I would be crying.

I left to go to my locker when I soon was flying down the stairs. Again, I turned around to see Brent with his foot out and a big smile on his face. "oops" he mouthed to me. I just shook my head and walked to my locker.

I opened it, and I suddenly felt it close upon my fingers. I didn't bother to turn around, I figured it was Brent again. I opened up my locker and it closed on my hand even harder this time. This time I turned around to yell at him, but I was sadly mistaken.

It wasn't Brent, it was his stronger friend......
