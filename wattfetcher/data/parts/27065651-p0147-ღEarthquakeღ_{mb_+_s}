Ah, ah ah

You're so good to me baby, baby
I wanna lock you up in my closet when no one's around
I wanna put your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
I wanna drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound
I wanna stay this way forever I'll say it loud
Now you're in, and you can't get out
[Chorus]
You make me so hot
Make me wanna drop
It's so ridiculous
I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe
You make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous
You're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby
I can make you feel all better, just take it in
And I can show you all the places you've never been
And I can make you say everything that you've never said
And I will let you do anything again and again
Now you're in, and you can't get out
[Chorus]
Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go
Ooh, yeah yeah
[Chorus X2]
You're so good
