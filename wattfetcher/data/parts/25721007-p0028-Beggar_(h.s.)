He sees me walking over his way and he sends a wave signaling me to come to him. It seemed to get ten degrees colder since I got out of the cab.
"I can't ice skate, Harry," I tell him once we're face to face. It's true, I've never even wore actual skates before.
"A hello would be nice," Harry lets out a chuckle and adds, "at least you're dressed for the occasion."
"I'm going to fall on my ass about fifty times," I warn him.
"Relax, okay? I'll help you," he says and puts his hand on my back, calming me.
"Okay," I agree. We walk to the counter and he gets us two skate rentals. I begin to think about what we're about to do and my nerves begin to act up again.
We put on our ice skates and start walking to the rink. My feet wobble as I try to make it to my destination. I say with a sigh, "I haven't even gotten on the ice yet and I'm already about to fall."
"Babe, you'll be okay. I got you," he assures me. Harry grabs my hand, giving it a small squeeze. The way he calls me the common pet name makes my heart flutter, but it doesn't keep my mind off of skating.
We finally reach the ice which Harry helps me onto. My instinct tells me to grab on to the railing around the rink which I do. He notices my actions and gives a small laugh.
"It's not funny," I roll my eyes at him.
"Do you not trust me?" He asks with amusement in his emerald green orbs.
"I trust you but-"
"But nothing, let go of the rail," he interrupts me and we start going around the rink slowly.

After an hour of Harry falling more than me, we stop skating. Somehow, I ended up being so much better than him. He insisted he was a professional, but I know it's a lie.
"Are you hungry?" He asks me once we turn in our rentals.
"Yeah I am when I come to think of it," I answer. My stomach starts to churn probably because I'm basically starving, but then it gets worse. I feel like I'm about to throw up, "Be right back, I have to go to the bathroom first."
Soon as I reach the restroom, I run to the toilet and my lunch is gone. I still feel sick afterwards. Something tells me to use that pregnancy test Eleanor gave me awhile ago. I refused to take it at first, but she convinced me by saying "you never know".
Harry probably thinks I died or something, it's been more than five minutes. I check the stick for my results. I dart outside to find my date. Once I see him, I tell him the news, "I'm pregnant."
So just a quick announcement, this will be the last time I update my stories for a week or two. I'm going to the beach for a little while. Sorry, but I'll try to update ASAP! I love you guys!! <3
