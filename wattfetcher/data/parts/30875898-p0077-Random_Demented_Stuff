When I slice that razor through my skin, I watch as the crimson bubbles up and comes out of the cut. That blood, that's what gives me validation. I'm still alive, I still feel pain, I'm not a zombie, I'm a human. That blood flow tells me, I'm still going, I haven't given up yet. As much as I've wanted to, I haven't died today. And as long as that blood keeps dripping from me, I'll always have my validation.
