Wow. I'm back again today. Shocking. I have weird thoughts sometimes. Idk. Just. I like living but I'm scared of what will happen. Like its a crippling fear that causes me to lash out and break down. I'm not too sure why, I mean, it's just living. But it scares me. Life is scary. I'm scared of the future. How am I going to transition alone? How will I do living alone? What if there's an emergency? What if I die and no one finds me until days after because I don't really have any friends and I live alone?What if I freak out or break down and don't know what to do or can't calm down because no one is there? What if my depression hits me like a brick wall and I can't get out of bed or I don't eat for several days?What if I harm myself and I can't fix it?Thunderstorms????Just. I'm scared. I thought I knew what I was doing. I thought I had a plan. I thought I had a life buddy. I thought I wouldn't have to worry about this. I don't know how I'll do this. I really don't. And I can't save myself from loneliness and isolation. I'm just stuck. Alone. Isn't that just peachy?
