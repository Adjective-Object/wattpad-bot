Ayden clasped his hands together loudly and huffed out. "Well, today was pretty exciting, I'd say. We fought off a lot of Combatants, we fell on a lot of ice and bruised our butts, we rescued Lino, and we gained another Rebel."
Lino raised an eyebrow. "Man, I don't know what half the things you just said mean."
Ayden chuckled brightly. "I'll explain later. But what you need to know now is that you're joining our group. Today, right here, right now. That, and that we're going to buy a pizza for dinner tonight." The circle cheered, but Jade had no idea over which statement.
"Now wait just a minute," Lino said. "Do I get a say in this?"
Everyone, aside from Jade and Tempest, said a big fat "nope," popping the "p."
Lino sighed. "As long as I'm with my sis I'm fine. That, and if I get to choose what's on the pizza."
A laugh was shared amongst everyone, and Jade hoped. Hoped that she could trust this guy, hoped that she could have a moment of calm for just a moment, and hoped that she wouldn't have to do anything like this ever again.
Then again, things hadn't really been determined by how much someone hoped of late.
