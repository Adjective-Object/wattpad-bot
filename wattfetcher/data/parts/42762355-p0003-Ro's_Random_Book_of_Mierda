In less than eight hours I have been out of my mother for 14 years... It's my birthday already, but I was born 8:40, so yeah...
I don't give a shit about birthdays, so I don't do parties with my friends, because fuck that shit and leave me alone to get closer to death. But my dear relatives get a party qwq Sweet mother have mercy... I'm terrified. So much awkwardness will happen. But the money is worth the trouble ; w ;
I think my grandmothers will be there. And my five uncles, three aunts, two godmothers... Three of my uncles have kids... So that's eight cousins at least. And two of my cousins have kids. So that's six second cousins of my future children. Grandma has four siblings... Other Grandma has eight or nine... With bad luck, they will come with their kids and they have kids, so many second cousins and their children... But the ones in Canada are out so that's minus fourteen. And my sister has a friend over. And shit... Dad's half-brother has a wife and two kids... I think the kids have dates. Few random people will also visit. Like Russian neighbours or people who work for Dad...
So clearly, I will have just enough people to entertain. But all of them pay me for it. So I will get tired, but also rich with few hundred euros.
Family is the worst :')
