Starring Cassie and Deanna.
I apologize in advance.
Knock knock-knock-knock knock.
Shave and a Haircut at Dean Winchester's door. Only one person does that.
"Come in, Cas!" Dean shouted from his spot on the couch.
The dark-headed boy walked in and made his way to the Winchester living room. He set his backpack down gently, having just come from the library.
"You know you don't have to knock," Dean mumbled.
"Dean," Cas said, after leaning down to kiss his boyfriend, "Gabriel has brought something to my attention."
Dean snorted. "What? His blood sugar?"
"No, Dean."
Dean sighed. "What, then?"
"He seems to not be able to stop crying about this movie."
"Sounds like him."
"Dean," Cas reprimanded. "The movie."
"What about it?"
"Well, once you see your brother cry about it for over two weeks, you kinda get interested..."
"What's this movie called, anyways?"
"Twist and Shout."
"Like The Beatles?"
"Like the Beatles."
"You have the movie in that bag, don't you?"
"Of course."
"Alright, pop it in."

"That Cassie's pretty hot," Dean comments. "I can see why Deanna's all over her."
"Dean."
"Nothing compared to you, babe," Dean corrected himself and kissed Cas' cheek.
"Damn right, nothing compared to me."
Dean chuckled and they kept watching. (They really shouldn't have.)
~*~
"Those milkshakes look fucking delicious."
~*~
"This movie is historically inaccurate. If a woman went to Vietnam then, she would have faced so much discrimination. And yet, here she is, perfectly fine."
"She has PTSD, Cas."
"... okay you got me there."
~*~
"I'll never look at milk the same way."
~*~
"But she's going to get better, right?" Cas sniffled.
"She better. Or I will hurt someone."
~*~
"WhAT THE FUCK?!"
"DEAR GOD. PLEASE NO."
~*~
"Dear Cassie..."
"KILL ME."
~*~
By the end of the movie, they had used two and a half tissue boxes.
"Fuck Gabe. Let's never do that again," Dean suggested.
A whimper and a nod was all Cas could offer.

Later that week...
"Hey Dean," Sam called. "Can you buy me a milkshake, I'm broke."
"AbsoLUTELY NOT."
"Well... can Cas?"
"GOD, NO."
"Well, excuse me then. Sorry to bother you two. Why are you crying?"
