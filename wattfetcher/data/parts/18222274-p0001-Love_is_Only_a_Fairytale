Just as I thought I lost him a voice crept up behind me. '' Hey princess.''
" AAAHHH!! ''
" Tommie! What has gone into you?'' You look like you saw your father in golf shorts again.''
" Heh heh, my dream wasn't THAT scary mom.''
" Well get up and get Jewel and yourself dressed. Breakfast is ready.''
" Ok."
Hey. My name is Tommie. I'm your pretty average 10th grader. Jeans, t-shirts, and A-B honor roll. I have curly, brown hair. My mom Jordan is a five star pastry chef and my daddy James is an art teacher at a university. My little sister Jewel is the best. She does what she is asked and just so adorable. Anyways, after breakfast my parents went to work and me and Jewel satyed at the bus stop.  I sit next to the new boy Oliver. He's cute and all but he seems to have a big crush on me. He shy and rarely talks to me. But when he does, he is a sweetheart. Eventulally we became best friends. After a few months he asked me out.
" Wow Oliver I don't know what to say.''
" Y-you can say yes. Please.''
And that's what I did.
