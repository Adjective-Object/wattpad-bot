*author note*Okay so I'm going to start off the story in 2010 and build the story up to present day. So I really hope that you guys enjoy my story. _______________________________________
Mrs. Knowles sat there at her desk acting like all of her students were reading her books and not talking about everything but school, but that was fine with me all I could think about was my date with Naill tonight.
"Alright class that's enough chit-chat for today I suggest you start reading before you get this sent home as homework." Mrs. Knowles said in her stern voice. *********Finally school was over I'm glad I'm almost done with that hell hole. *ring ring ring* my phone was ringing"Hey Naill we still on for tonight" I ask happily "Of course I'll meet you at the park. Oh and dress warm we might be out there a while." In his caring voice."Thanks for looking out for me see you tonight.""Later Sky"
Great now I have to choose a whole new outfit. But it's okay if it's for Naill. I really love that goofball, he completely turns my day around if I'm having a bad day he is just perfect.
