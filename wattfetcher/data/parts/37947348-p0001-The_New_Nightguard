My best friend Emiliep (yes, that's her real name) thrusts a newspaper in my face, the page open to an ad.

Emiliep smiles.
"Sounds fun, am I right? Let's apply together! Oh, maybe we should ask KK too." She's referring to our friend Kirsten, who normally goes by KK. Being the nerd I am, I normally call her potassium squared, as K is the symbol for potassium on the periodic table of elements. Anyway, I sigh.
"Injury? Dismemberment? For every normal person, that's a giant red flag." She rolls her eyes and gives me a small shove.
"Cmon! It'll be fun! And, we'll die together, at least."
"How soothing." I retort, and she smiles at me again.
"I think it'll be fun. And you need to get out more often!" Rolling my eyes, I comply.
"Fine. But if I die, I blame you."
^^^^^^^^When we get there, we're greeted by children swarming around old, dilapidated animatronics of animals. They kinda freak me out. Emiliep glances at me before walkin to the front desk.
"Hello. I'm Emiliep, this is Emily, and we're applying for the nights guard position." She says. The man looks at her with a tired, annoyed look.
"Hi. I'm Mike. You've made an extremely poor career choice, girls."
"Okay. . . do we have to, like, fill anything out?" I ask, and Mike shakes his head.
"Nope. Your uniforms are in the back. You'll be joining a few others in your position, myself included."
"Okay. . ." Emiliep mutters, and Mike rolls his eyes.
"Okay. Come back at 12. Okay? Okay. Enjoy your time at the Pizzeria!" He says u unenthusiastically while lamely doing jazz hands. We walk away as Emiliep nudges me.
"Well, he's. . . pleasant."
"Yeah seriously."
