My family is bothering the crap out of me right now. ðŸ˜•
Everyone is seriously bothering meðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜’
As you know ( probably) a bunch of stuff has been going on in my house and stuff with me online.
And during everything that's been going on at my house, not one person asked if I was okay.
Not my mom.
Not my dad.
Not my step mom.
Not my aunt.
( not all those people live with us )
And with everything at my house and online stuff, a bunch of stuff has happened at school to.
So I'm not really in a happy joyful mood.
Super depressed right now, I haven't ate nor left my bed today.
It's 2:00 and I've been up since 7:30.
And no, I'm not writing this for attention.
For you to feel bad.
I just wanted you to know that this is why I'm not talking to anyone at the moment.
I've been ignoring a lot of you and that's why.
Just wanted to make all of that clear. ðŸ˜‘
