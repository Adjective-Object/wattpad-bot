"Dean!" Cas yelled to a sleeping Dean. When Dean didn't respond, Cas jumped on the bed. "Dean!-- You've!-- Gotta!-- Get!--- UP!" he yelled between jumps.
"Mmm..." Dean groaned. "What do you want?" he grumbled.
"Dean, there's white stuff on the ground!"
Dean's mind perked up at that.
"What does that mean?" he said, voice slightly gravelly, as he just woke up.
"Dean, outside! It's covered with white! And more is falling from the sky!" Cas exclaimed.
"Oh," Dean said, "so it's snowing."
"It's what?" Cas asked.
"You know, snow. The pretty white flakes that fall from the sky? Kids play around in it? Some people say it's romantic." He says the last part with an eyebrow waggle, and Dean had no idea why he said that part at all. It's something Sam would probably whisper "dea-stiel" at and run away.
"Dean, I don't know what that is."
"Okay, we have to fix this. Now. Go get Sam to get you more clothes," he added, glancing at the old AC/DC shirt of Dean's Cas was wearing. "Snow is very cold."
30 minutes later, Dean and Cas were standing in the snow. Sam opted to stay inside, supposedly making hot chocolate for when they return, but in reality (the little shipper he is), he was watching from afar with binoculars.
"So... what does one DO in the snow?" Cas asks.
ME, IF THE SOMEONE IS YOU, Dean's mind screams out, but instead he says, "Well, lots of things. But let's begin with the basics."
"The basics?"
"NUMBER ONE," Dean says. "Snow angels."
"Snow angels?" Cas asked.
"Lay down," Dean instructed. Cas did so. "Now, move your hands and feet back and forth. Like windshield wipers." And Cas listened again.
"This is very cold," Cas commented.
"Okay, that should do it. Get up."
And when Cas got up and looked at what he had made, he looked so proud, it made Dean shudder.
But he blamed that on the frigidness.
"Okay, next," Dean said when he could no longer bear it, "most people build a snowman."
"They make a man of snow?"
"Uhm, sorta. Here, lemme show you." Dean said, and he made a mini snowman.
"Are they always so... tiny?" asked Castiel.
"No, this is just a... replica, I guess."
"I think it's beautiful, Dean."
And Dean's cheeks flushed, and again, he blamed it on the cold.
"Okay, one more thing, then we go inside. Capishe?"
"Yeah, I capishe," and Cas sounded disappointed.
"I saved the best for last, I'll have you know," Dean was building suspense. "Two words: Snowball. Fight."
"What?" Cas asked.
To show him, Dean made a snowball and hit him in the chest. "Snowball fight."
"I see," Cas said, wiping off the excess snow stuck on his chest.
And then, World War III happened. Snow flying everywhere. Love spilling out of their hearts and they didn't even know it.
