~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


In the place where I stood was a grass field. It would have looked beautiful, but the entire atmosphere felt sullen. Probably because it was raining, but it wasn't pouring too hard.


"...'Where was I?' and 'What am I doing here?'..." I wondered.


Then, I thought of something that could give me an answer: I tried pinching myself...and felt no pain.



....Ah, yes. So this is a dream, after all.


Finally understanding what kind of situation I was in, I began to wander across the field. It was raining, but I didn't care. It's not like I'll get sick; this is just a dream. While I was walking, though, I felt my clothes grow heavy. Maybe it was because my common sense was still working, making my brain think that of course, my clothes will get soaked from the raindrops that landed on me. When I looked at my clothes, I noticed something strange.


I was wearing a black formal dress, along with black lace gloves and shoes to match. My whole outfit practically screamed, 'mourning'.



......Mourning?



Upon the assessment of that thought, I walked further through the field. I trudged along, feeling the moist soil against my shoes. I felt bothered by the noise it made, but my mind swayed from it...for I noticed that I was approaching a large group of people.


These people had very familiar faces. Some were looking down whilst wiping tears from their eyes, others looked like they were choked up in sobs and the rest just stood there silently, but looked as sorrowful as everyone were. As I edged closer to them, I saw it.


I saw a long, white coffin.



My heart started to pound as I grew nervous. Would it be okay for me to see...?



Then, I looked around at the people present, they were also wearing black outfits. I'm a part of this, too? ....I'm...grieving with them...too...?



Taking a deep breath, I slowly stepped forward and peered over the coffin.
