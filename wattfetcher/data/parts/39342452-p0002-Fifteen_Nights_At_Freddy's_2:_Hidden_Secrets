I put the mask on, and suddenly, I get dizzy. Words chant in my head:

Ten dead children, ten fractured lives;
Two involved, both may not survive,
The one who suffered will make a choice:
Will he let anger and fear control,
Or forgive a unpredicted protocol.
One choice affects another's life,
But will all stay together in this mortal strife?
Suddenly, I'm pulled from the dream and into darkness.
"Remember the prophecy..." the voice whispers as I fall into the dark.
