Germany: We--We're being eaten one by one...That's what I would do, if I were the Thing!!
Italy: ......
Prussia: That's enough, West!! There are still many other ways to get out of here!
Germany: ... Sorry.
I can't... think like that, but... I feel as though I'm in a battlefield. Though, if it were one, I could keep myself together and protect you...
I want to change this.
Japan: You can't help it. You hate this kind of thing.
Italy: ...Germany.
Germany: Hmm?
Italy: It's okay; you will be okay.
You'll be able to get out this time. And if you get out, run straight ahead.
Don't look back, no matter what happens, and get time--
Japan: (Time?)
(What is Italy talking about?)
The Thing suddenly appears behind Italy.
Japan: Italy!!
Prussia: Italy!!
Italy's eyes well up and gives his friend's a sad smile.
Italy: Promise me, Germany.
Japan: (Italy is going to...)
Germany: I..ta..lyyyy!!
Suddenly, the screen goes black and time went back to normal.
Everyone was able to move again.
I was able to move again, as well. But...I feel so faint...
I can't hold myself up anymore.
My legs gave away and I collapsed on my knees.

(A/N): -----
So, this chapter is more on what's going on in your (reader-chan's) mind.
I actually feel pretty unsure about this chapter and I don't really know how to express it in the words I want..but I did the best that I can.
I mean, I want to explain how reader-chan feels about everything that's happening.
When you play a game, it's easy enough to make decisions because you can just save at some point and just reload if you get a "Game Over"... but that's happening to reader-chan for real. (well, reader-chan's reality)..
Of course, you really need to question why you're there, how you'll get out, what'll happen next, what to do, what not to do...and all that...
And for a person of that age or of a young age like ours...isn't that just too much?
We're in a point where we have this information, we have knowledge...but we can't risk it..we can't risk anything because...it's a matter of life and death.
Life is precious.
