That little joke you told? The one you thought was meaningless?She paid for it in her blood.
That little insult you made? The one you didn't think twice about?She paid for it in her self-esteem.
Those little laughs you had? The ones you didn't mean?She paid for it in her confidence.
Those little ostracisms you do? The ones you don't take seriously?She paid it for it in her tears.
Those feelings you caused? The ones that you don't have?She paid for it with her life.
