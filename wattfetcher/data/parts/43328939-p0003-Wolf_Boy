Two of the wolves started play fighting in the middle of my living room. They were getting dangerously close to knocking over my mom's vase. "Hey!" I shouted. I turned to Hunter. "Stop them!" Hunter barked again, like before, and the wolves stopped. He narrowed his eyes and gave them a wolf stare. A small threatening growl rose from his throat and they both stopped and submitted, whining. Hunter was on his feet, leaning on the crutches heavily, but he looked stern and strong.
I've changed my mind. Wolf boy is the alpha.
"That's so cool. What's everyone's names?"
"The three by the fire are Dakota, Tara, and Lyle. You know Akita, and the gray one laying on the rug is Jana. The blonde one is Tara, and the two white ones are Diego and Tula. The gray one on the couch over there is Humphrey, and below him on the floor is Elle and Luca."
"Wow. That's a lot of wolves." I muttered.
"There's 12 of us." He said. Then he looked down at Akita below us. "Soon to be 14, maybe 16."
"Wow." I whispered. Wolf boy laughed.
"Hey, who's the Luna?" I asked. Wolf boy's yellow eyes turned cold and hard as gold.
"She was killed by a hunter." He muttered.
"Oh. Wow I'm sorry about that. What was her name?"
"Mya. She was a white one." He said.
"Hey, wanna watch this?" I asked, gesturing to the TV. I was trying to change the subject. I've experienced enough death to last me a lifetime.
"What is it?"
"The Little Mermaid." I said, smiling.
"Never seen it." He muttered.
"What? Where've you been your entire childhood?" I meant it as a rhetorical question, but wolf boy gestured around to the wolves.
"I've been with them since I was 8." He muttered sadly.
"Wow," I whispered. "I mean, you must have some memories left over." he shook his head.
"I can't remember anything about my old life except what my name was and a warm feeling, followed by the colors brown and blue. That's it. No faces or anything. Just colors."
"That's really sad." I muttered. "So, what exactly is your name?" I asked as the tawny one, Tara, walked over to me and jumped on the couch. I smiled at her and rubbed her ears.
"Hunter."
