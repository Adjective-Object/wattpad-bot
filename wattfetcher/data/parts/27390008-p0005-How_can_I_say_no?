"Flight 110 to London now boarding." The overhead speaker said. Johnny and Samantha got up and threw away their food. They ran to the gate and got seated on the plane. They were right next to each other. Soon the plane took off. Samantha was holding tightly to the arms of the seat. Johnny noticed and put his hand on hers. He squeezed it gently. She opened her eyes and looked at him. She flipped her hand and squeezed it.
"Thanks." She said once they were leveled out. Johnny nodded. Soon Samantha fell asleep. Johnny looked at her and kept holding her hand in case she woke up and got scared again. She turned in her sleep.
"Samantha." Johnny woke her gently. She opened her eyes slightly and hummed. "Want to use my shoulder as a pillow?" Samantha nodded and Johnny lifted the arm of the seat, pulled her closer to him, and wrapped his arm around her. "There. Go back to sleep. We will be here a while." Samantha nodded.
"Turns out I might not have you figured Johnny." She said before she went back to sleep.
