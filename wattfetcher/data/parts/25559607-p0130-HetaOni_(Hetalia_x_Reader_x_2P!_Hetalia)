Japan actually gave me a small smile. "Italy, you are very kind. But even though my eyes are dulled, I know that you are lying.

It is so

...out... together......" At that...Japan gave his last breath.

"Sorry. This is where I fall." China accepted, clutching his bloodied arm.

Russia spoke up, his voice almost cracking, "I'm glad we could make... a new breach, at least."

"Come now, Italy, don't cry; just go. If you stay here, that monster is going to show up again." France told me, his once bragged-about clothing now bathed in blood.

I shook my head, "But--"

"...Prussia, will you take care of Italy? He's fast on his feet, but it's hard to fight that monster." France cut in.

Prussia placed a hand on my shoulder, "I know. I'll do it."

I noticed Frenchman slowly closed his eyes upon hearing that, "France?"

".....Quickly. Don't let our efforts be in vain. Really, you're so slow on the uptake." Russia said.

China nodded weakly, "If you stay here, you're only going to get in the way. Just get away, quickly."

"Let's go, Italy. Let's get out of here." Prussia told me, pulling me to the door. I was very hesitant, but eventually followed him. I overheard them as I was outside, in front of the door.

"You really are perfect for the role of villain."

"You're quite the actor, yourself."

"I have to find... Japan... quickly.While I got all sluggish here... I forgot again..."

"... China?

......Haa... Even in this place...I'm all alone yet again..."
