"Indeed. Everyone has noticed it by now. Though, I hope he will tell us tomorrow, as well.."
"I wonder if he really will. He has that determined face. As if he thinks that ordinary methods won't work."
Japan nodded and spoke in a remorseful tone. "Yes, it is just as you say. I can't help but think that he looks like someone who has been standing all alone in a far away place for a very long time."
"Then we have to run over there and catch him." America said as he gave Japan's shoulder a hearty pat.
"Huhu. Definitely. We should all catch him together."
~~Japan then decides to sleep~~

"Prussia!! What happened to Japan?!" Italy asked frantically.
"......He fell asleep. Very... deeply.", the albino replied, trying not to show the anguish in his voice.

(It's because I remember so many things...Maybe it's a backlash? I'm beginning to forget the memories from long ago.)
(When did I first meet Germany? What was the alliance that bound us? When I was little, I made some kind of promise to someone,didn't I?)
(Maybe I'll be able to remember if I can get out of here?)
(Everyone is... breathing, right?)
(Yeah, Japan is even moving. Thank God.)
(I didn't know this place existed, and I really didn't think that I'd still be alive...)
(Another thing would be ______. I... This...This is the first time she appeared...She knows something...but I don't know how that happened. Oh..but she's been helping quite a lot...so...it's good, I guess...)
(If I've come this far, the next thing to do is...)"
