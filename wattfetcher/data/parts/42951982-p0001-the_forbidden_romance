4 years ago in the middle of the night........      The door creaks open. I hear it. I hide under the covers thinking if Bob thinks I'm asleep he will leave me alone. He walks over to me nd I have to suppress a shudder. I wished my mom was faithful so her creeper secret lovers left me alone. I mean hell I'm  only 13. This has been going on for a half of year. When I tell my dad he shrugs it off as a lie to get his attention. So I'm in this he'll every time he's not here. Bob Lucy's the cover up nd slides in beside me mgs says,"Juliet wake up for me princess I wanna show you what me nd your mommy done tonight." I feel his hand try to wrap around my waist nd I start to cry silently. He starts kissing my neck nd I turn my head away. He's rolls me over nd says,"your not being very cooperative." Nd slaps me in the face. I try to push him off of me but he punches me in the face. I black out.
3 1/2 years later.
I'm dreaming, I know I am. I can't wake up. I still feel Bob's hands on me. I can't believe my mom still messes with him. I'm so glad I have a spot I hide at while he's here. I register that my alarm clock it's ringing. I roll over nd slam my hand down on it. My dad comes to my door nd raps on it. "Wake up Juliet.  Your mom is climbing through her ass cause your not up." "Fuck her." I whisper. I hear my dad  walk away from my door nd down the stairs. I roll my eyes nd say "Poor fucker, won't listen to me but bows down to her every command like a lap puppy. It's pathetic." I go to take a shower nd take my time so I'm purposely late to work. ==================================
This is the end of this chapter. Tell me what do y'all think of Bob? Hate him right? I hated writing that part. But  y'all needed to know why Juliet hated get mom and dad. Do y'all think Juliet had a right to be mad at get dad?
