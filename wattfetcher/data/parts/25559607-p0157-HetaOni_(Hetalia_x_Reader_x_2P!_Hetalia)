"France, your injuries... are you okay? Japan is still breathing, too... Thank God. America... you can still move a little... right?" Italy asked weakly.
(("What--what the hell?! Stop, please! Not again!!! This time it's Italy?!" America exclaimed.))

Italy suddenly collapses on the floor, all bloody and bruised.

(("Oh!!" Japan let out as he saw Italy fall.))
"I... did it... I... saved... everyone! I made no mistakes...!" Italy managed to say softly.
((Even though I already knew about this, my eyes still felt like it got pricked when I saw the Italian's state. "Italy!" I tried to call after him, though he wasn't able to hear me.))

Italy gave a weak chuckle. "Hehe... Your injury looks serious... but you're alive, so you'll heal. Thank God... thank God my ruse worked..."

(("...Ruse?" America asked, looking at me and Japan.))
"Guys, you may not know this, but... this is actually the second time we came here... The first time, I wasn't useful... at all...
I could finally get you back... Thank God...But I'm sorry... now it's my turn to fall..." Past Italy explained to the others.
Past Germany, who was holding Italy in his arms, got confused upon hearing that. "You've got to be kidding? The second time?! That makes no sense!"
"I went back in time, you see... I managed to get out of here. But I was the only one...who got out...
I didn't want that. I had to get you all out..."  Italy answered, tears streaming down his bruised cheeks.
Past France knelt down beside Italy and reprimanded him. "You--you idiot! You didn't have to get us out! You had to get out with us!"
"I-Italy..." Past Germany shook.
"Q-Quickly... let's carry Italy... Anyone?! Isn't there anyone who can move?! What about China and the others? Aren't they back yet?!" Past America asked the others.
Past Prussia began panicking. "Make... make a place where we can rest! It can be anywhere! I'll look after him! A really safe place! Someone!!"
"I can hear their voices... I was all alone back then, but now they're alive. I'm so happy...I'm so happy, but..." I heard Past Italy's thoughts.
Past Italy turned to his blonde German friend and spoke, "Hey, Germany..."
"H-hold on... Italy... Oh, I know! I will make a place for you. The best place for you to rest at ease..." Past Germany reassured him, his usually serious face now showing overflowing emotions of despair, worry, fear, to name a few.
Past Italy smiled. "Really? Heheheh. Then, will you make lots of beds... where everyone can rest?
And then I'll peacefully rest... between you and... Japan..."
"Yes..." Past Germany nodded.
Past Italy continued, "And a biiig table, too. I also want a place...where we can all cook..."
"Yes. Definitely..." Past Germany's eyes started to water.
"......Ger...many..."
"Yes, Italy?"
