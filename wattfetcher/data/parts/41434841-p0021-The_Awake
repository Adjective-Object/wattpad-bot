Jordan said to keep up with this. That it's good for me or something. I don't see how. But I have nothing better to do.
I got a lizard. His name is meatloaf and he is my new reason for trying to live. He's small. A few weeks old and about as big as my hand. He looks pretty cool. I'll throw a picture of him up top.
I've gotten seven hours of sleep this week. That's probably not healthy.
My headache is getting worse.
Oh well.
I hate this.
