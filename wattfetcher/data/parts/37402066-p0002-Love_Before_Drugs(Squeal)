"Only If You Promise To Meet Mika Tomorrow"
"I Guess I Could Meet Her"
I Really Didn't Want To. I Don't Think Any Girl Is Good Enough For My Dad Plain & Simple. My Standards Are Just To High. I Would Kill Over My Dad. I Hope His Lil Girl Friend Knows That.Or Else It Won't Be Pretty For Her.
I Was Sitting In Foot Locker Trying On Some Sneakers. This Lady Walked In & Sat Next To Me. She Was Dark Skin With Brown Eyes. Her Hair Was Cut Short, She Was Cute. But She Look Stuck Up.
I Could Feel Her Watching Me As I Walked Around The Store With Lexus. We Bought Our Sneakers & Left. This Chick Is Crazy Following Us Around The Mall.
"Lexus You Feel The Eyes"
"Yea I Thought I Was Losing My Mind"
"Nope Bur Look Like We Got A Fan"
"Well The Fan Need To Back Up Before I Hurt Her"
I Laughed At Lexus But She Was Right. Before I Could Walk Up To Our Stalker She Walked Away. I Seen Her Holding Some Lil Girl Hand & An Older Girl Next To Her. Lexus Told Me Let It Go & Shop So We Bought A Few More Things Before Leaving.
We Picked Up Some Food On The Way. I Had A Feeling Something Was Going To Go Wrong. I Could Shake The Feeling. I Speed Going To The House. I Grabbed All My Bags Out The Car.
"Daddy!!" Me & Lexus Were Screaming Our Lungs Out
All The Guys Came Running Down Stairs. They Were Out Of Breath With Their Guns Pointed At Us. The Looked So Worried.
"You Girls Okay?" My Dad & Uncle Donnie Were Checking Us Well The Boys Checked Outside.
"We're Fine But Some Lady Was Stalking Us In The Mall"
"Your Not Leaving Without Protection Anymore"
"Dad I Protect My Self I Got This"
Someone Knocked On The Door Before My Dad Could Respond To Me. He Opened The Door & I Was Shocked. I Grabbed The Gun Behind My Dad Back & Pointed It Ready To Shoot.
