Hi. my name is Spencer. I am 21. on my 16th birthday my parents died because they were hit by a drunk driver and died instantly. they invested in a huge 3 story house for me when they died. I didn't move in till I knew that my friends would move in with me. I moved in with Jc,Kian,Greyson,Dalton,and my friend Ellie. we live in Penslevanna in a 3 story house with a indoor pool, dance stududio and 21 rooms with a hidden 4th floor.
