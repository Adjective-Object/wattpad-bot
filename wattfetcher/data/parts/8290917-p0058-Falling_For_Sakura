"I'll just go and apologize to her right now," Tristan announced. "And give her a peace offering-a hug and a kiss."
He was about to walk out the door when Sebastian jumped up from his seat and pulled his brother back by the collar of his shirt. "Now?" he asked. "It's bloody midnight. She's probably asleep."
"Sebastian's right," Nicolas said. "We'll do it tomorrow morning."
Sebastian saw the look in Nicolas's eyes and said, "You're not going to give her kisses, are you?"
"Why not?" Tristan put in. "You kissed her."
"On the forehead," Sebastian said through gritted teeth. "It was a brotherly kiss. I am, after all, her adopted brother."
"Yes." Tristan teased him. "We shall give Sakura brotherly kisses and hugs tomorrow."
"Like hell you will!" Sebastian snapped. "Now get out of my room."
"Night, bro." Tristan chuckled. And one by one, the brothers left his room, leaving Sebastian alone and wondering how the hell he was going to keep his brothers away from Sakura. How the hell was he going to protect her from them? And then he wondered at just how the hell he was going to protect her from himself.
