"Yo, Eddie!" Dale threw Eddie's pack of dinosaur books onto him. "Get up! Guess what today is!"
Eddie sat straight up, remembering. 2 minutes till his alarm clock would blare everybody's ears off at 7:30. No wonder his room mate wanted to wake him up. Eddie quickly got out of bed and unplugged the alarm.
"Got your bags ready?" Asked Dale.
"Yep. 4 of them. Plus this one and the shotgun." Eddie said. He pulled out his usual polo shirt and shorts and got dressed. He brushed his teeth so they were perfectly white. He styled his hair like Dr. Grant, putting on his black cowboy hat as a touch. He put on a survival vest with pockets and holders and things like that.
"When will the helicopter pick us up?" Asked Eddie, as he opened the door and he and Dale left their apartment.
"3 o clock sharp," Dale sighed. "They sure said that if we were late we'd be with the next group in 2 weeks."
"Well..." Eddie sighed. "We better not be late."
"No possible way!" Dale assured Eddie. "Ed, we're only 45 minutes from the helipad! And we can grab breakfast. C'mon, Ed. Really? We'll be there at 9:30!"
"Ok. But let's stop by Walmart and grab some flares and cans of food." I say.
"Good idea! don't want to be hungry, now do we, Dr. Edward?" He asked. "Speaking of food... Dog food... Is Butch coming?"
"I don't know... I can't risk him getting hurt... I'll buy a muzzle and plenty of food for him and 6 leashes and 6 harnesses." Eddie shrugs. "So yeah? I guess he's going. Nobody said that they could keep him, so really I have no other options."
"Dude, relax. Do we really need all that?" Asked Dale.
"We'll be over there for at least a year," I point out.
"Good point," sighed Dale. They took the elevator, and left the apartment building and went outside to the parking lot. The 2 loaded the Toyota Truck (which had a extended cab with camper top) and put Butch in the back. The little Labrador Retriever puppy curled up in some blankets they had for him back there, ignoring the luggage. Eddie tossed him a bone, which he happily began chewing on.
Dale spread him out a pee-pee pad for when he had to go. Eddie smiled, patted his head, and crawled out of the enclosed truck. He slammed the back of the Toyota camper top and got in the drivers seat. He cranked it up and headed for the Cracker Barrel across the street.

Inside the 2 sat at a 4 person table, when Lauren Sanders walked in, and saw the 2.
"Hey," Lauren pointed to them at the back when she checked in. The woman nodded and watched her closely as she came to us.
Eddie through up a hand. "What's up, Lauren?" Eddie asked.
"Nothing really... So nervous and excited!" She said. She sat down beside Dale, who stared wide eyed at her, like she was a raptor.
"I know... But I'm more scared to be honest... We don't know what we're dealing with.. and Dr. Grant or Malcolm won't be there. Yah know?" Eddie asked.
"Yeah... Dinosaurs.. Not just veggiesaurs. But Killersaurs too..." She sighed.
"You know," Dale said, getting close to Lauren. "It's easy to save somebody."
"Um.. If you want to die it is." She got up and switched the sides of the table and sat beside Eddie. Eddie's heart started beating. She's so pretty, he thought.
"Yeah ok... She's right, Dale. Anyways, Dr. Mitchell will be there. It counts." Eddie says.
