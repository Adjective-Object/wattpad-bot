"Do you want a drink?" Zayn snapped me out of my thoughts. It would be nice to forget about Harry for a night and cloud my brain with intoxicating substances. It's been awhile anyway.
"Sure," I smiled and followed him into alcohol central, aka the kitchen. There were lots of looks exchanged my way by guys mostly.
Zayn handed me a red, plastic cup which I kindly took. I pressed it to my lips and sipped. The drink left a burning sensation down my throat, but it was a good one. Though, not enough to get the image of a certain curly haired guy out of my head.
"Have you seen Harry yet?" I couldn't help, but ask.
"Yeah, he went into a room with some girl," he spoke. That means he has to be having sex with her. I think I'm about to be sick.
"Oh," was all I could say. The bile rose it my throat. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way? I don't even like Harry. He's rude and doesn't even care about me.
But you do like him. I was reminded by that stupid voice in my head.
"Something wrong, Lennon?" Zayn questioned, "You look pale."
"Uh.. Yeah, I'm okay. I just need to sit," I gave a small smile.
We sat on the couch for about five minutes. Both of us were silent while I drank my second cup of alcohol. I couldn't help myself except drink him out of my mind.
Or maybe I could use Zayn to help me..

My fourth cup now settled in my hands. Zayn and I constantly laughed at the most stupidest things we could say. Which were mostly dumb pick-up lines and knock-knock jokes.
"Okay, I've got a good one," Zayn chuckled.
"Alright," I smirked, taking a sip from my drink. I couldn't even feel the burning anymore.
"Knock knock!"
"Who's there?"
"Dwayne,"
"Dwayne who?" I smiled like a crazy person. I don't even remembered who I was worried about anymore.
"Dwayne the bathtub, I'm drowning," Zayn spoke in a child's voice and we both burst into a fit of giggles.
"That.. was.. the most stupidest.. joke.. ever!" I said between breathes of laughter.
"Your turn," Zayn smiled.
"Actually, I have to go to the bathroom. Be right back," I promised and he took my drink.
I have no clue where there's a bathroom around this place. I walked the upstairs for two minutes until I heard undeniable shouting. I couldn't help, but eavesdrop. So I put my ear against the wooden door.
"Why would you let him hang with her?" A familiar voice growled. I could recognize that raged voice anywhere. Harry.
"Maybe if you weren't such a damn asshole, that could be you," shouted a girl's voice. It sounded like Eleanor.
"I.. I never know what to say around her. I'm afraid I'll mess up. I'm afraid she'll laugh at me," Harry lowered his voice. Who is he even talking about?
"I've known her for a little bit now and she is not the type to do that to people, Harry," Eleanor's tone was also low, "And don't be a jerk. Just because you have tons of tattoos and a few piercings, doesn't mean it should change your personality."
"That's not why I'm so mean and you damn well know that El,"
