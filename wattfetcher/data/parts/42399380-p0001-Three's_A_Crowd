Seven years. For 7 years I have felt completely safe and entirely freed from him. After what happened, my mom finally had the courage to take care of things and move on with life. After he was taken away, I felt all the fear lift off my shoulders and felt what was called freedom for the first time. That was until my mom called me and my sister Lea into the family room for an urgent "discussion".
"Zoey, Lea! Come to the living room now! This is urgent and we need to hurry!" my mom yelled down the hallway. It shouldn't be so bad,  I mean she overreacts all the time, like that time when our dog Cap got out and ran away. Or when our turtle died. Or that time when she found out twinkies weren't going to be sold anymore. So when she called us, I was expecting something like "Zayn left the band" or " New episodes of 'Orange is the New Black' are on Netflix". What I was not expecting was something that would bring back an old feeling.
"I just heard news that he's getting out. He had a good lawyer and only has to serve another six months and can leave right after that. So, that gives us six months to pack everything up, sell the house, and move to a new state". My heart stopped. All the freedom left and the fear came back to pay rent on my shoulders again. Lea was older than me and she bawled her eyes out. I mean I wouldn't blame her, she had to live with him for much longer. Yeah she's in college, but she wanted to stay with my mother and I just in case something happened. Like this situation for example.
It only took us an hour to choose what state to move to, a couple days to find a house that we'd like, two weeks for the house to be sold, and a month to move. That's how scared we all were. The day we were all packed up and were ready to leave, I cried for the first time in seven years. Leaving my childhood home, the house I grew up in was depressing. Yeah, the first ten years of my life made terrible memories and sucked, but there was still good memories too. And I cried along in the backseat of the car for half of the four hours it took to get to our new home in Iowa.

Okay so this was short and i'm soooo very sorry! But this is my very first story and i'm really self- conscious about it :(  I just have so many ideas for so many different stories and I know where I want to go with them I just don't know how to start them and it sucks. If I knew and if I had time I would have started writing them a while ago. But I promise after the first couple of chapters are done I will get the hang of things and make the chapters much longer! Im also going to try and update at least 2-3 times a week:) xx
