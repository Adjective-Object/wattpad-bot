Bri's Diary Entry-
9th grade, the start of my new future, that will bring me to my adult life even closer. Oh hi.. I'm Bri! I am Rudan C.'s little sister, my mom just decided i could move in with him for my high school years. So i now live in Texas with him! Oh btw.. this is my diary entry in my high school diary.
Bri's POV:
*beep beep*
Ugh!! First Day of High School. I'm a little scared. Then my big brother comes running in my room screaming "Wake your ass up" in a asian mom's voice. I laugh then hop in the shower. I decided to wear a paris shirt saying "PARIS AMOUR" and a skater skirt that was black. I straighten my hair since i was mixed. Then i get a text message from my best friend Hannah! She was telling me that she would meet me at the bus stop in 20. I finished getting ready and i still had 10 minutes so i decided to go on my Instagram.Then , i get a follow from two dudes i didn't know but they were younowers. I go to the first dudes page whose username was @BruhItsZach. He had lots of followers and i was like well dang i only have 545 followers. Then the nest dude had almost as near as Zach and the username was @Edertaining.
I walk outside and start walking to the bus stop and see Hannah we run to each other and screamed. It had been a long time since i seen her, since i used to live with my mom. The bus finally pulled up and we get on the bus and there was like only 10 people. we arrive to school and have to go to the gym for orientation. I bump into one boy who was super cute and familiar.
