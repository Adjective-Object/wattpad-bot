GUYS HAVE YOU WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE OF UTA PRI: MAJI LOVE REVOLUTIONS?!
Opening Song: The Dice are Cast by Quartet Night
And the episode was so cool like. SSS? WHO DO YOU THINK WILL WIN?
STARISH OR QUARTET NIGHT?
OH and today's episode was so... Flirty.
Every guy was being flirty to Haruka. EVEN SYO.
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT HE SAID TO HARUKA
"The sky may fall, the earth may shatter. But my love for you will not change."
Reminds me of my other story of Syo which is Titled "Time" in my backup account Akira_2718
If you haven't checked that out, please check it out!
The Ending song was super cool! The MMD dance moves are... PERF!
THOSE HIPS THO.
And I get the feeling that this season is going to get a bit shippy. Like Ren x Ichi in the ending song. And Syo x Ittoki.
SO! Have you guys watched the first episode?
Rant in the comments about what you think about todays episode!
(The picture tho ahahaaahahahahaa)
