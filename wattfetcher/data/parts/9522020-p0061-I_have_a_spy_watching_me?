I nodded.
"What's yours?" I asked Dad.
"Being dumb." My mate snickered.
Jaycie was hiding her laughter as Dad pouted.
"Kiara! Blake and Misty told you to stop calling me dumb!" Dad said in a childish voice. "I'm telling on you!"
I busted out laughing with Jaycie. Kiara only grinned.
"I can tell my Mom and Dad that you're being mean to me." She said.
"They won't believe you."
She snorted.
"Please they believe me more than you. Go have fun with Jaycie now. I'll be watching..." She didn't know my name. I almost forgot.
"My name is Alexander. You can call me Alex or Alexander." I said with a shrug.
"Or Xander! That's what I call him!" Jaycie said going into my Xterra.
"Why are you...?"
"Dad's taking the Xterra since it's my dream car. FYI. Thanks for the keys!" Jaycie said and they drove off.
I just smiled with a shake of my head. She was now next to me grabbing my hand. I felt a jolt of electricity fly through me. She dragged me inside and I was against the wall. She held onto my jacket.
"Tell me right now, have you ever had sex with anyone?" She said and I was almost choking on my shock.
I just stared at her with wide eyes.
"No. Who would I do that with when I was to shy to meet anyone? The only people I know are the people at my college. Then again I knew very few people at my old orphanage." I said.
"Orphanage? You-you lived at an orphanage?"
"Thirteen and older. My mom couldn't take care of me. I never lived with my dad before. Yesterday was the first time I met Jaycie and Paul." I said.
"Oh. I'm so sorry." She said losing her grip on my jacket.
"It's fine. You've done nothing wrong." I said as I lightly talk to her.
"Lets talk about mates later. I'll take you around our territory if you want." She said as she pushed back her hair.
"Take me to the flower shop?" I asked.
She raised an eyebrow.
"For what?"
"I'm going to pay my respects to my dad's mate." I replied.
"How..?"
"I met her before. She had seen me walking around her old territory and said that I should be careful. She and I talked after and she asked me who my parents were and I told her. She knew my dad and I asked her how. She told me 'I'm married to your father. We have children.' She had asked me if I wanted to live with them even though I met her at seventeen or something. I denied and she was fine with it. She knew I wasn't really ready to see my dad. She also knew it was a long shot since I was seventeen. So she gave me suggestions to what to do with my life. The one that I loved was to travel. I did. I also got arrested once as I had looked like the person that was wanted. It was fun up to that point. Also I came here from China. Which was a place she had said to go to." I rambled.
When I looked at her she looked at me with admiration and another emotion.
"That's really cool." She lightly said. "Come on I'll take you now."
