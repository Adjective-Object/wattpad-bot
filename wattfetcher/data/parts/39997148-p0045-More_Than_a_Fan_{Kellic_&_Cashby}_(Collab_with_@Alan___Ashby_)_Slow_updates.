Austin's POV

I never got my McDonalds. Tino lied to me and we've been driving for two hours and I'm starving, I think I might die of hunger.  I groaned and rolled off the couch laying on the floor.
"Austin... what are you doing?" Alan asked looking up from his laptop.
"Being bored and angry and hungry."
"Why are you angry?"
"Cause I'm hungry and bored."
"There's leftovers in the fridge just eat those." Tino said and threw a ball of paper at me.
"I don't want those."
"Then you're just gonna have to starve because we're not stopping."
"Fine."
"Like I said before, you're a crybaby Aust." Alan said.
"You're a crybaby." I mocked, "At least I don't... have to do school stuff. I can have fun."
"That was just lame Austin." Aaron said, "I thought you were better than that."
"Well when I'm hungry I'm lame."
"I think you're always lame."
"Well he's always hungry too so I guess it makes sense." Tino said as Phil kicked me.
"Did you have to kick me?"
"Yeah I did." He said kicking me again, "We're here by the way."
"You guys are mean to me." I whined and stood up.
"Crybaby." Alan said shutting his laptop and getting up and walking off to his bunk.
"Am I a crybaby?"
"A little." Aaron admitted.
"Am not," I said. "You guys are just mean."
"No really you are whiny."
"Jerks," I told them and went to the door. "Well I'm going to go get food when is sound check?"
"An hour."
"Alright, I'll see you then."
"Austin! Can I come with you?" Alan shouted.
"I don't know, are you going to call me a crybaby the whole time?" I asked as he came running back to the lounge area.
"No, but I have to take some pictures of landscape so you'll barely notice me."
"Alright well come on." I said opening the door.
He smiled and walked out the door with me behind him.
"So where are we going to go?" He asked looking around.
"Whatever we can find."
"Oh okay, I saw a Denny's a few streets from here." He said and stopped to take a picture of something.
"Well then let's go to Denny's."
"Sounds good, just give me a sec." He said taking a few more pictures of random things.
"How many do you have to take?"
"A few here and there." He said. "We can go now."
"Alright." I said and we started walking again in an awkward silence.   God why was this awkward? It shouldn't be we've talked before. It has to be because of our conversation this morning, that's the only explanation I can think of.
