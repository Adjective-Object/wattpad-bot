//Third Person PoV//
Italy slowed his pace a bit and sighed, "They got really mad at me. Germany's face was so scary... straight out of a nightmare."
As he looked down on the floor, he noticed something and crouched down to inspect it.
"......Is this...blood? This place was free from blood a while ago... I swear there wasn't a monster here at this point in time..." Italy thought out loud.
He then spots something beside the drops of blood on the floor-- a small metal key chain that spelled, "Hetalia" in green, white and red. It seemed familiar to him.
Where has he seen this item before?
After thinking deeply, he snapped his fingers. "Ah! This is from the bella ragazza with us! She's with Germany and the others, right? Or...hold on--I don't think I noticed her go inside..? What? No... Sh-She's in the cell, too, righ--"
A sudden ringing of a phone was heard, surprising the Italian.
"Eeeeeeek!!! Germanyyy!! Japaaaaan!!" he shrieked.
He snapped out of it and looked around him. "Oh, right, they're not here..."
"My phone...? Scary... Who is it? And how can they call me, anyway?" he muttered whilst taking his phone out of his pocket.
Italy's eyes opened wide when he saw the name of the caller, "What?!"
"Um! Roma--", he said upon answering.
"You IDIOT!!! What took you so fucking long to answer, goddammit?!" someone on the other line angrily shouted with a thick Italian accent.
"What?! What? It's true?! It's really you?! How? You are Romano, aren't you?!" Italy asked frantically.
"Of course it's me! Ack, wait--Spain!! You can't take my phone! Give it back!" Romano shouted.
Italy gave a look of disbelief. "Spain, too?! It can't be true... Why?"
"I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Now listen, Veneziano?
...? Are you crying?" the Southern Italian asked as he heard sniffling on the other line.
Italy shook his head. "No, I--I'm just so happy. Hey, Romano, can you fill in for me at work tomorrow?"
"Huh?"
"Tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, and forever and ever... Can you?" Italy asked, his voice cracking.
"......No." his brother answered.
"Romano?"
Romano huffed. "It's your job. Just get your ass back here and fucking take care of it yourself!"
"An....... real..... idiot..... well......ly..." the other line started getting choppy.
"Romano? I can't hear you! Hello?! It got cut off..." Italy realised.
He then placed his phone back in his pockets and gave a small smile. "Hehe! Their voices. It's been so long!"
"... I wish I could go home." he said softly in a sad tone.
=========
"Tsk! It got fucking cut off. Oh, well. At least I got to call him."
