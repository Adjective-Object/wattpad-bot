dearest noel,
i don't even know why i'm even writing to you, because you'll never get to hear these words. not now. not ever. and you know what? that breaks me even more. everytime i pick up this pen and place it between my fingers. look at this blank sheet before me. and listen to nothing but the sound of my thumping heart.
a little part of me breaks over and over. each time.
but it doesn't matter. because even in death you're the one who always made me feel most alive.
all those memories you've left me with noel is what makes it so much more painful.
you wanna know what was my favourite memory?
i don't know if i ever told you that but this was the one moment that nothing mattered anymore. this was the moment where i let everything just slip away in complete darkness. that moment i felt like i belonged.
do you remember that night?
it was a cold, december night and everything was so much. dad kept hitting mom and i couldn't help her. he hurt me too. i remember how i ran all the way down to the beach. the wind dancing on my face. the darkness consuming me with every pounding footstep i took against the concrete roads. then i saw you right there.
and i remember me running into your safe arms.
and you held me so tightly in your warmth right below the stars.
your eyes sparkled just like the stars noel.
and i just knew in that moment.
everything would be okay.
somehow.
someday.
once i had you noel.
i could survive.
