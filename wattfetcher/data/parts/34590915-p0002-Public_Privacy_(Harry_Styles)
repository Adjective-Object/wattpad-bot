“Harry.” He whispers. I frown.
“Why are you whispering?” I ask quietly.
He looks over to me then back to his lap. His face is very shadowed in the dim bus lights. He doesn’t answer.
“Well, Blue dear, I’m afraid this is my stop.” Diedrie says after an awkward silence.
“It was lovely to meet you Diedrie, I hope you’ll be doing more evening shopping soon.” I chuckle.
“I’ll make sure I do. Goodbye!” I wave goodbye as she steps off the bus. As promised, co-op is right behind her.
I stay quiet. I glance at Harry only to find him looking at me with sparkling green eyes. I smile and place an earphone back in my ear.
A.N. I DEFINATELY will finish this one! I PROMISE X
