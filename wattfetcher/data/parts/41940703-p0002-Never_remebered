"M-my hair is blonde."
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
"What's wrong with blondes?" Alfred asked me.
I looked at both of them then remembered that both of them are blonde.
"Um, nothing, it's just that my hair is originally brown." I said pointing at my hair.
"Oh love it's alright." Arthur said walking up to me.
"Wait a minute, no it's not." I said stepping away from him.
They gave me a confused look.
"You aren't supposed to be real, you guys are from and anime based on the countries." I said then brought out my phone, which surprisingly I still had.
And showed them an episode.
once it was down I put my phone in my pouch then said.
"Your America, your England, I'm a regualr girl that was magically brought here by some wierd thing!"
"Woah dudette breath." Alfred said walking to my side.
I took deep breaths then had the urge to cry.
I wasted no time fighting it then tears fell from my eyes.
"Are you alright?" Alfred asked me.
"No, I don't wanna be here." I said bringing out a pocket knife from my pouch.
"what are you doing?" Arthur asked.
"Ending it." I said then jabbed the knife into my chest.
I felt little pain then brought it out.
"Why am I not dead?!" I asked.
I looked at them who were staring at me in shock.
"Why?!" I repeated.
"Love you're a country." Arthur said.
'A country?!' I thought.
