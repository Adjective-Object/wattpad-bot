Sakura nodded her head. "It happened when I ran... I don't know what to do, Jane. I have to return these items, but how much do you think it'll cost to fix the gown?"
"Let me look at it first," Jane said.
A few moments later, Jane was staring at the rip piece and finally sighed in surrender. "I'm sorry, Sakura. It's a one of kind gown. Only Mr. Tachibana knows how to fix it. It's so delicate and intricate."
Sakura fell back onto her seat, her heart sank at the thought. After all the dramas she had went through in her life during the past years, she knew on this occasion it wasn't going be as easy as finding someone who was good with threat and needles to fix the thing. "Well, there's only one thing I can do. Return it as it is to Mr. Tachibana and face his wrath." She shivered at the thought and began to imagine all sorts of nasty things he'd say to her the moment he found out what she had done to his beloved gown.
"I'm afraid so, Sakura."
Sakura sat up and reluctantly asked, "Then would you mind taking me to see him?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thanks." She threw herself back on the sofa and eyed the crystal chandelier as the prism of light played about the room. "What about the necklace?"
"It belongs to Lady Suzuki. You'll need an appointment to see her. I heard she hardly sees anyone. She's very private, if you know what I mean."
"Do you think you could perhaps make me an appointment to see her?"
"Sure, I'll see what I can do," Jane said. "Don't worry, Sakura. Everything is going to be all right."
Sakura sat up and nodded. "I hope so. I'm in such a pickle, aren't I?"
"Yes, you are." Jane couldn't help herself and chuckle.
Sakura got up and headed to the door. "Now then, let's search for my missing painting."
"Of course," Jane said, following her friend out.
