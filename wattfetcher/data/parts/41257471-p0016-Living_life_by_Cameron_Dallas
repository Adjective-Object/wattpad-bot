At the house
I got out my car and Sammy was at the steps.He got up when he saw me and hug me i push his chest and he had hurt in his eyes."Whats wrong?" Sam said "Nothing is wrong i just dont want us to hang today, its a mother daughter day" i said back "I know your lying" he said grabbing my hand.After he touched my hand i heard a car pull up. "Let her go" i heard a voice yell i turned around to see Carter.
"Carter?" i said as Sammy lets go of my hand i tell my mom to go inside and lock the door and dont let nobody in and run to Carter "What are you doing here Carter?"Cameron wanted me to check if you were home or at the boy striper thing but then i saw him holding you and you were pulling" he said "Carter dont tell Cam Sam was here he knows Sam and i been seeing each other but i dont want Cam to hurt him or anybody" i said letting a tear slip "Ok but come with me" Carter said grabbing my hand and leading me to the car.
At the boys house
I went in the house and saw all the boys except Cam in the living room i went and sat next to Matt.After awhile of watching Keeping up with the Kardashians Cam came through the door furious then when he saw me he grab my arm, all the boys look at him with what the heck look.When we went to the room Cam through me on the bed "What the hell Cam" i yelled getting my self up "What the hell you saying you were gonna do it" he yelled back "I thought you trusted me and i didnt go i went home" i said crossing my arms and trying to leave the room.Cam grab my waist and pull me to him and kissed me i didnt kiss back but him being so ignorant he grab my butt making me open my mouth and started putting his tongue down my throat (not litterly).
After doing that for 5 min or so i went to take a shower after i took a shower i put some of Camerons clothes i put one of his white t-shirt and some sweat pants and i went to sleep.
