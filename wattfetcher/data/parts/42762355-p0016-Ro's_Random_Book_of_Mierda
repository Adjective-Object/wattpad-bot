I think I'm trans. I've always seen myself as one of the guys. I don't understand girly things nor give a fuck. I've always been very manly as a person. I know I would be better as a man.
But I'm a girl. And I don't really mind. It's not like I have this burning need to "be myself". I'm myself even as a girl. I'm a manly girl. Many think I'm a lesbian or a tomboy, but I really aren't. I don't see myself as a tomboy. I'm kind of... neutral when it comes to my sex? I don't know how to explain. But could I be trans? I just don't want to do a gender surgery. I don't need that.
I must be stupid. Maybe I... Like I might just be nothing "special"..? I really don't know. I'm straight. I don't find women attractive in any way. I think some are beautiful and that they're awesome friends, but there's just no romantic or sexual attraction.
Shit... How do I explain? I'm a man in a woman's body, but don't feel the need to... get out. So technically I'm gay?
Or then I'm just one fucking badass woman.
