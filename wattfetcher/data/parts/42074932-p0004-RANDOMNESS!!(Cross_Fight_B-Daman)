Sumi and Rory:*Chatting while walking*

Simon:Sh-sha!Its the girls!!

Misuru:Don't worry,just block your eyes.

Simon:Why?!

Misuru:Cause if you can't see them,they can't see you.

Simon:Alright.*blocks eyes walking*

Simon:*bumps into Sumi*

Sumi:Ouch!Oh hey Simon!!

Simon:Sh-Shaaaaa!!!!*runs away*

Sumi:Simon come back here!

Rory:Sumi wait!

Misuru:Guess I was wrong..*whistles and walks away*

Heh,I didn't know what to name the title so I just came up with'Misuru was Wrong'.I took this from the Amazing World Of Gumball by the way.
