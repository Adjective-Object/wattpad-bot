The Northern Italian furrowed his eyebrows and spoke, "You......you knew all along?..."


"Y-Yes...I'm sorry I hid it from you guys... I didn't think you guys would believe me just like that... also there are other things to consider..." she replied, looking away.


Russia clicked his tongue, "But--"


"--I'm sorry, but is it okay if I continue my explanation later? I've got some things I need to sort out with myself... Besides, Italy's not yet done with his explanation, right? Let's listen to him first..." (Name) said, her lips starting to tremble.


France gently pat the girl's head and told her, "It's okay, fille, take your time." he then turned to the Northern Italian and spoke, "Italy, may we please hear the rest of your explanation?"


Though Italy wanted to hear out (Name)'s explanation, as well, he nodded and continued his explanation. "Where was I?  Ah, yes..... That time when first went to this mansion.....


We were just going to have fun. We were going to go home soon.We opened the door and came in, but...as you know, there was that monster inside.


We all ran in different directions and I got lost from everyone, and I was so scared and had no idea what had happened.


I wanted to find someone as quickly as possible


...After walking around a lot, I found Japan. I was really happy, but...." Italy paused for a moment, trying to blink away tears that started to form in his eyes and continued,


"... he had just been beaten by the enemy.



Until then, I'd completely forgotten that Japan had come along. There was a gap, as if  something had been erased...


While I was thinking that there was something wrong with my memory...


China, Russia, France... America, Canada, and England were killed one by one...


By the time I'd finally be able to escape, Prussia and Germany were also killed, and I was the only one still alive."


"You were... alone..." France said in a low voice, looking down.
