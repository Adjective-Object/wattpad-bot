He starts to find himself thinking how nice it would be to have his own pastry shop, have Allen, Mattheiu, and even dear poppet, (Name) to help out, and of course make delicious cuppy-cakes! Francois would probably hang out at the shop, too, but he might just slack off there, which is fine for him. The more the merrier~ It'd also be lovely if---....


......What was he thinking?

"Look at me, trying to fool myself." Oliver muttered to himself as he realised something.


How could he possibly think that he could live a normal life after this?


He's just a Second Player.


It would never work out.


~~~ "We have words, right? It could work..." ~~~


The poppet said that before, didn't she? Her suggestion was actually futile because...they already did try to use words before. Okay, maybe words with knives and bats and poisonous cupcakes...but with words. Maybe....Maybe with poppet, they could actually have an agreement with those...First Players?


It may sould preposterous right now, but... maybe (Name)'s onto something.


(Name)...


From the very start, she did prove herself to be someone, didn't she?


Knowledgeable and brave, yet cautious and considerate.


She didn't judge us the way the rest of the world did. For a human, that's saying a lot. In this world where you can't win, (Name)'s that person who turns it all around and stops other people from bringing others down. True, they were somehow dark and have bloodlust, but that was because of how they were created. Despite that....they're... people, too. No one understood that before. They all regarded them as filth, as monsters, as something that was purely inhumane.


People who are not meant to be shown kindness.


That's who we are but....


~~~"Ollie, I may care for them...but I actually care about you guys, too." ~~~


"......but why are there people like her who tell me otherwise...?" Oliver choked out, tears threatening to spill down from his eyes.
