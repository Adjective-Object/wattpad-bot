"I wanna see her" Damon walked past me but I caught his shirt and pulled him back.
"No you won't because she's not covered and she probably will break your ribcage this time if she knows that you saw her without hijab. She's Okay don't worry" I patted his shoulder and closed the door behind us.
"Thank you man, I owe you one" He hugged me.
"Ew back off" I pushed him playfully.
"Why did you take off her hijab" He asked angrily.
"How was I supposed to help her and clean her cut ?" I asked sarcastically.
"You better forget what you saw" Damon threatened.
"Is that jealousy" I giggled.
"I believe it is" Damon answered confidently.
"Oh no, you like her too" My eyes widened.
"What ?" Damon frowned.
"Nothing, I need to go get Leena some medicine" I opened the door.
"Wait for me, I'll take you home and pass by the pharmacy" Damon said and I nodded.
My player best friend likes my crush. Great, and he lives with her too.
Applause for the worst luck in the world.
Damon's POV:
I went to the pharmacy and asked for a proper medicine for Leena's condition.
I hope she gets better soon. She's been unconsious for an hour and I already miss her eyebrow move and her insults, I'm sick worried about her, I've never felt like that for any other girl I've dated, maybe that's because Leena's different.
Everything about her is interesting from head to toe, her special independent personality is what makes me crazy.
I need to have her in any possible way.
I came across a flowers' shop and bought her some red roses, about 50 rose .... Money babe, It's all about the money.
I pushed the door enthusiastically with medicine in one hand, flowers in the other and the key in my mouth.
I ran to Leena's room (Aka: The girl of my dreams' room) and knocked on the door 3 times.
"Wait" Leena shouted "Come in"
"Hey" I walked toward her bed and sat at the end of it.
"What do you want" She asked with a straight face.
"Your head looks enormous with the bandages and hijaab" I exploaded in laughter.
"Get out. ELINAAA COME HERE" She shouted.
"Hey hey, calm down, I just came to give you this" I gave her the medicine, her eyes softened a bit.
"Thank you Uhhh, I-I'm sorry for being rude, I'm just having this terrible headache" She played with her fingers nervously while regret was filling her eyes ... Oh her eyes, the ones I'd die for ... No I won't because Oh, I'm such a chicken I couldn't even call the police when she with Tom and Peter did the prank.
"So Uh, how are you"
"What ? are you talking to me ?" I raised my eyebrows in shock.
"Of course not, I'm talking to the wall behind your back" She raised an eyebrow.
"Even when you're injuried" I chuckled.
