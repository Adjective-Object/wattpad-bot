Do you sometimes feel like you're just breathing? Like you don't have a purpose in this world. But you are just there, for the sake of living. Like you are dead inside?

Jake face-palmed himself, as soon as he sent that text. What was he thinking? That's right, he wasn't. Whoever that person was, could be dangerous. And he sent the text first. But he didn't have much time to think about it, since his phone beeped indicating that he had a message.
Damn, that person is fast, he thought.

You can ask anything. Question is, will I answer it?

Jake let out a small chuckle, surprising himself as well. He didn't know what it was, but he did feel eager to talk to that anonymous person.

Well, whoever that person was, was taking quite long to reply. He quickly ran downstairs to grab a bag of Cheetos before his sister claimed that as her own as well. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend of two months. He was the same guy she thought was her soulmate. She had called her friend Abrielle again and they were talking about how shit of a guy Mason was. Jake wanted to barge in and yell "I told you so" at the top of his lungs. But that could wait till after Abri left. He didn't expect anyone to be in the kitchen, and neither did Abrielle and that's why she let out a surprise squeak when she saw him. He noticed that she was wearing his shirt. He was going to kill his sister for this. She was surely the one who lend her the shirt. According to her, Jake was madly in love with Abrielle but didn't want to admit it because he was "a macho man". What? But as much as he hated her, he had to admit that she looked hot in this shirt. She was quite tall, so it reached her thighs and even if she was wearing shorts, he couldn't see them. When she noticed him staring, she smirked.
