*one week ago*I just seem to have the worst luck that one person can possibly have. My terrible luck seems to have gotten me here; running through the forest, injured, and weak.You may ask how in the world is that so terrible, it's more of how everything laid out to be like this.See it all started when my parents died in a car crash. My stupid pack thought it was all my fault even though I wasn't even in the car, after this happened they decided to demote me to maid and pack punching bag. I'm not going to get into gory details, but let's just say I've gotten a lot more than a few cuts and bruises. So while everyone is asleep I'm running towards the border, being a rouge won't bother me as much as being apart of that pack.The border is now in front of me.Freedom here I come.I stepped over the border.
