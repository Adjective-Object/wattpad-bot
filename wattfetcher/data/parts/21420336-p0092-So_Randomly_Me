Why does everyone feel the need to talk to me when I'm mad?!
Like seriouslyI'm pissedThis means "No I'm NOT okay""Yes I wanna die""If you made me mad don't look at me."
People don't seem to get that
It's like earlier this girl didn't do something for me but she didn't it for her boyfriendWho had broken up with her before cuz if Harry potter
I'm like,"You know what I'm just tired of your bullshit, you only come to me with your problems but when I want to talk to you you're gone."
Obviously I apologized But she was already gone
But seriously  she texted me asking why I was being mean
Idk maybe it's because you hurt my feelings again!
Okay I'm done shhhh now we will move on...
So guys I was wondering how would each of the heroes of Olympus characters die?
I have come to the conclusion that:
Frank: stick or monsterHazel: old age or monsterPercy: most likely old age since he's planning on staying in RomeAnnabeth: ^^Nico: monsterLeo: well idk he might already be deadJason: old agePiper: old age
And yeah that's what it seemed like to me, opinions?
