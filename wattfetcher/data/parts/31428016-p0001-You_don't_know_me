"Ma'am, we need to know who your parents are"
My eyes were blazing with anger, pinning the cop with a murderous glare.
"You don't need to know shit"
"Ma'am, we will send you back to social services if you don't tell us now", he was getting impatient, that much was clear.
But I wouldn't respond.
"Dakota please, social services isn't something you want to deal with at seventeen", he was desperate now and I didn't want to deal with more shit than I already had.
I gave him a nod and heard his loud sigh of relief.
Oh my sweet parents and brothers,
Dakota is coming back.
