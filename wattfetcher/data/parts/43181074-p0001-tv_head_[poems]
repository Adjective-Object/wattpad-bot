its the way
her hair
sticks up
in the middle
of the night


its the way
her feet
shuffle
against the
carpet
on cold
winter
nights

its the way
she grabs
your hand
and there's
that little
shock

that makes
you love
static

its the way
she makes
you laugh
when you kiss
her bones of
static

it's almost
as if
all you
ever see
is that
little shock
everytime
she holds
someones
hand

and it
makes you
miss
the times
you'd
kiss her
and then
you'd get
that little shock
right after

that makes
you love
static

and then one day you get so fucking high and drunk because you miss her so fucking much and you remember when you missed her for seconds and then minutes and then hours and then days and then years because of her rose nipped cheeks and her buttermilk skin and her cherry blossom lips and her static, her fucking static hips and her static collarbones and static wrists and static ankles

but you
cant have her
because you
didn't love
her enough
