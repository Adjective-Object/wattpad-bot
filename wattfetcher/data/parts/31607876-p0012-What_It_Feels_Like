Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines    he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Chops"    because that was the name of his dogAnd that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A    and a gold starAnd his mother hung it on the kitchen  door    and read it to his aunts That was the year Father Tracy    took all the kids to the zooAnd he let them sing on the busAnd his little sister was born    with tiny toenails and no hairAnd his mother and father kissed a lotAnd the girl around the corner sent him a     Valentine signed with a row of X's    and he had to ask his father what the     X's meantAnd his father always tucked him into bed at nightAnd was always there to do it
Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines    he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Autumn"    because that was the name of the     seasonAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A    and asked him to write more clearlyAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door    because of its new paintAnd the kids told him    That Father Tracy smoked cigarsAnd left butts on the pewsAnd sometimes they would burn holesThat was the year his sister got glasses    with thick lenses and black framesAnd the girl around the corner laughed    when he asked her to go see Santa     ClausAnd the kids told him why    his mother and father kissed a lotAnd his father never tucked him into bed at nightAnd his father got mad    when he cried for him to do it
Once on a paper torn from his notebook     he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Innocence: A Question"    because that was the question about     his girlAnd that's what it was all about And his professor gave him an A    and a strange steady lookAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door    because he never showed herThat was the year Father Tracy diedAnd he forgot how the end    or the Apostle's Creed wentAnd he caught his sister    making out on the back porchAnd his mother and father never kissed     or even talkedAnd the girl around the corner    wore too much makeupThat made him couch when he kissed her    but he kissed her anyway     because that was the thing to doAnd at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed    his father snoring soundly
That's why on the back of a brown paper bag    he tried another poem And he called it "Absolutely Nothing"Because that's what it was really all about And he gave himself an Aand a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom door    because this time he didn't think    he could reach the kitchen.
