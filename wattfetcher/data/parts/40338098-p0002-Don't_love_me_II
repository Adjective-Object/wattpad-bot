After three hours Ina had to go home since her brother was on visit and she just sees him two times every month.. I decided to stay with the boys since I finally could see them again. Me and Harry was holding hands, but no one commented it at all.. It was great.! I don't know what's going on between me and Harry, but I won't ask about it now.. We walked over to starbucks to get a coffee, and Harry buyed me one. I tried to pay for it myself, but he refused and did it.. "So Maybelle.. How are you?" Niall asked me after we sat down. I looked at him and smiled a little. "I'm okay, and you?" I asked him back. "I'm fine" Then it went all quiet. It was kind of awkward, but as long as I could be with Harry, I was okay.. After about an hour we decided to get back home. Harry asked if I wanted to come home to his place and of course I said yes.-At Harrys-He was home alone all weekend so we could hang out here as much as we wanted to. We walked up to his room and he turned on one of his games. I layed on his lap while he was playing. His hands was around me and I felt so safe. I do miss him as my boyfriend.. I really do.. But how can I tell him that? I turned around so my head was against his chest. He stopped playing and turned it off. He then cuddled up with me and held me real close. "I miss you Harry" I said. I shouldn't have said that! He looked at me and gave me the cutest smile ever! "I miss you too Maybelle" I smile back to him and before I knew it his lips was on mine again. -2 minutes later-He was looking at me with the cutest smile and I couldn't help but stare at him. "I think I still love you" he said after a while. "I think I still love you too" I replied. I do love him..? Right? I think I do. I was sitting on his lap now. It's weird to think that we went from bestfriends to enemies, enemies to a couple and then from a couple to just bestfriends again.. I like him.. He's everything I want in my life.. I need him in my life!
