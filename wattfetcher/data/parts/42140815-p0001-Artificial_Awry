There was a blue birdAnd it liked to singBut something was wrongIt was the bird's wing
The moment it hatchedLittle blue bird sawThat now in its lifeThere would be a flaw
The bird could not flyIt was small and frailThose blue feathered wingsWould never set sail
The little bird wouldLook up at the skyAnd sometimes it wished To one day fly high
But hope never ceasedAs little blue sangMelodies of joyWith a voice that rang
And then the day cameWhen it's voice falteredThat was the dayOur lives were altered
There is a blue birdYou hear as it singsAnd now it flies highWith heavenly wings
