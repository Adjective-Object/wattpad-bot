What am I doing to myself
I ask everyday when I think
of  you,
Well ,so what am I doing
to myself , chanting your
name when I don't even
know what mine sounds
like to you,
Does it  sound  like  the
ocean kissing the shore
like yours sounds to me
or does it  sound  like
broken dreams ,
A replica of what you
are to me.
