If only I had been there. She had probably been ambushed. If only I had been there...  I exited the alley, dirty and covered in blood. I needed to clean up. I couldn't control my anger. I noticed a bug crawling by me, and crushed the thing beneath my paw. Snarling to myself, I crossed the tall furless thing's walking stone(the metal killers did not come onto these, which was odd to me) and made sure no metal killers were heading my way. I had seen a dog get crushed under the spinning parts of one.
I ran across the black stone as quickly as I could. I couldn't stop thinking about mother. I knew where the group cats lived. I was going there tomorrow, even in the day. No matter if I was tired. I was not going to be aggressive, I told myself. I was going to talk with them.
I would just smell the scent of every cat. I'd find out which one killed my mother. And I would find them when they were alone.

A small stretch of forest sat in a corner of the city. There was a stream there. Avoiding other night life and black stone stretches,  I made it there in a short amount of time. The sky was overcast, in contrast to the hot sun in the day. I heard running water, and I knew that that was the stream.
I walked under a thorny bush and emerged at the pebbly edge of the stream. I did not hesitate and jumped into the cool stream. I felt the cool water washing away the grime and blood, and I broke down. The grief and anger consumed and I sat there in the water, letting all my feelings out. I screeched into the night air. The water cooled my fur and my mind, and after a while, I left the stream. Shaking my fur out, I was cold. Like mother. But unlike her, I was alive and burning with rage.
Tomorrow.
