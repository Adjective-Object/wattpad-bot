Once, when I was closeSo close to the edgeWhen I felt like any day would be my lastI felt a strong desire to liveSo I told my mom how I feltAnd her showed her my wristsAnd she laughed And she jokedAnd she teased meAnd then she yelledAnd then she made me feel like shitAnd then she punished meAnd all I could think is, "Why did I think this better than dying?"
