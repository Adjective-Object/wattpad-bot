I will admit that I am horrible at being in relationships. Not that I'm a cheater or anything but I'm just not girlfriend material. And all my past relationships have failed. I think the shortest one I had was back in kindergarten (I was a player XD no, no jk). Um it lasted a day and I think I talked too much for the poor guy. I don't even think that counts BUT we'll say it does.
And you're probably wondering how someone like me is going to give you relationship advice. I mean the first line of this states 'I will admit that I am horrible at being in relationships'. I am horrible at being in them, I am pretty good at giving advice on them. I'm taking mine and my friends' horrible relationships and turning it into advice. SO you might hear about my failed relationships here and there.
This is to help you through your relationships or just to help you understand. I hope that you all enjoy this and if you ever need advice and don't want everyone to know, you can always PM me.
Next chapter is on side chicks and main chicks (this is also in my book Girls Only: Girl Code)
