Hi. My name is Sarah Jane. You might think that Sarah Jane might seem like an original name, and sure I guess it is, but everyone has pretty unusual names. My two best friends are Kristine Megan and Sierra Lin. They are the best. Our world is different. I'll tell you that now. Everyone is gay here. I mean even Kristine and Sierra are even dating and I feel like a third wheel! They have been trying to set me up with other girls, but I'm not interested. Sadly my friends don't understand me. I'm not different like they are. I am normal. I am straight.
