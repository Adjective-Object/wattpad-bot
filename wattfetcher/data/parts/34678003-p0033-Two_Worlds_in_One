Shortly after Chase went into the bathroom and I sat on the couch and played on my phone, he came out of the bathroom. He was wearing khaki pants, a short sleeve blue polo with a small NAPA racing logo near the collar and he traded his usual Nike tennis shoes for tan traditional Sperrys. "Hey" he said coming over to me and taking my hand. He pulled me up from the couch. "Hey! You look handsome" I smiled at him. "Thank you, and you look beautiful." He kissed my nose. "Now, shall we?" He offered his hand and I took it. We walked out of his motorhome holding hands."So - do you want me to drive or you to drive and me to tell you where to go?" I asked as we walked closer to my car. "I'll drive - if that's okay.""Yeah, sure thing. Il just tell you how to go. And no - we cannot take any shortcuts through the cornfield. The farmer lives down the road and would certainly kill me!"He just laughed, "Don't worry - I totally get how the farmers would be absolutely pissed if someone tore through their fields.
