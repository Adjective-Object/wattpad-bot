A/N- Warning! Sappy, pathetic alert. I'm turning into that kind of poet  again... -_- I need to stop reading so many romance novels...
Beautiful girl...
She's a beautiful girl, but she doesn't know it yet
I know everything about her, we'd be the perfect duet
I know she loves to dance, and sing, and likes to have fun
And I know that she crys when it's over and done
This beautiful girl, I'm not sure why
This lovely girl, would want to die
Her silky hair,
The way she tosses it back without a care
Those soothing eyes,
I hate to see them when she crys
She's a beautiful girl, but she doesn't know it yet
I knkw everything about her, we'd be the perfect duet
I can see it in her expression, I'm too late
She's begging for affection, asking for a mate
Selling herself for pleasure, but hating the wait
Getting the money, but not wanting to be bait
I stare at this woman, I'm at a loss for words
Just let me hold you, beautiful girl, and I'll show you
That you're more beautiful than anyone in this world
Beautiful girl...
