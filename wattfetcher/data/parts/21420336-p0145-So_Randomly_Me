I have two books in my library that update 20 times a dayIts soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooAnnoying
I stopped reading it since I can't even see when other books are updated anymore
Be considerate childrenI don't care how popular or good your book is if you bother me by updating so much I can't see anything else on my notifications I will stop reading your book
