My name is Ariel :3
I'm 13 (does it really matter how old I am?)
I'm single
Bisexual, if you have a problem with that then go cry me an ocean and get over it.
I'm friendly, funny, caring, stubborn, and loving person. I can be a bitch at times, but only if you piss me off.
With me being my stubborn self I don't give up on anyone or anything. At least not anymore.
I made mistakes in the past. HUGE mistakes. But I'm human, I'm bound to make mistakes. Those mistakes made me who I am today and depending on who you are that could be a good or bad thing.
I don't know if I'm considered emo or goth, all I really know is that I'm me, no one can change that.
I love bands like BVB, PTV, SWS, MCR, BMTH, BOTDF, FIR, Fall Out Boy, Skillet, Panic! At The Disco, Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead, and Evanescence.
I love sketching, making/listening to music, anime, batman, sims 3, Hot Topic, and food.
That's about it, if you want to know more or if you just want to talk don't be shy and pm me. If any of you need someone to talk to about anything I'm here for you, pm me anytime.
