Movies are not very realistic for example characters never sneeze or burp OR fart they also never go to the bathroom or wash their hands. The characters clothes are always clean and their shoes fit them perfectly. They never drop there phone or tie there shoe laces.
But in real life we do all these things but it would be funny if a character farts in the middle of an awkward silence.
