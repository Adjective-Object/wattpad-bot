"Yes, honey. What's up?"
"Nothing much. We just have a stray roaming around the house."
"Huh? Oh, Maddie! Hello! I am so happy you are here."
"Um yeah, Cindy, she's been here for a while now."
"Oh, why didn't you just come up here and get me?"
"Cindy, she didn't know where to go."
"Oh, right. Sorry, child."
"It's okay."
"If you could just read this over and sign it, I can get you settled in."
"Thanks."
I read over the list of rules and once I was finished, I signed it.
"Grab your luggage and then I can show you to your room," she said.
"Oh, I got it." Derek took the stairs by threes, grabbed my suitcase and backpack, and ran back up the stairs.
"Thanks."
"Haha don't mention it."
"Okay, right this way," Cindy said.
We walked through the other door and into a hallway that was identical to the guy's side.
"You will be sharing a room with April."
"Oh shit. Are you sure that's a good idea, Cindy? You know how she is."
"Well, Derek, that's where the last person moved out of, so that's where the new person is gonna be."
"I'm sorry," Derek mouthed at me.
I shrugged my shoulders.
Once we were inside, Derek set down my stuff on the empty bed across the room.
"Well I guess this is where you'll be staying. With April."
"Is she really that bad."
"Well I'm friends with her, but she's bad with new people."
"Great. Just great."
"I really am sorry."
"Well don't be."
"Okay. Hey, I'm gonna go back downstairs. You can come join us when you are done."
"Thanks."
He left the room and left me in silence. I began to unpack my stuff and put it in my area.
A little while later, when I was sitting on my freshly made bed, April walked in.
"I don't know who you are or why you are here, but this is my room and my house and my friends. You aren't going to take any of that away from me."
I looked at her, astounded.
"Did you hear what I said?"
"Yeah."
"Then why didn't you answer me?"
"Why should I answer to you?"
"Oh you did not just say that."
"But I did. Get used to it. I'm not going to have someone like you talk to me like that."
"I sure hope you heard what I said when I walked in here or you'll regret it. Oh and by the way. Derek is mine. Not yours. Not anybody else's. So back off."
"Fine."
"Good, glad you understand. I'll see you at dinner." She smiled at me and strutted out of the room.
