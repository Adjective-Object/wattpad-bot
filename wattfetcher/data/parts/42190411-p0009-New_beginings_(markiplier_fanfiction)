She asked"Oh I'm fine I was wondering I you wanted to come over for dinner?" He asked"I don't mind." Jessica says as she steps outside of her apartment and closes the door. Both enter marks apartment. She sits at the neatly laid out table."It looks really nice mark, you out did yourself." Jessica says as she admires the table set up"Here you go here is a nice slice of pizza!" Mark says as he  places a plate in front of Jessica"Why pizza?" "I....sorta....burnt the pot roast." Mark says making Jessica laugh.Mark and Jessica eat and talk. After dinner mark and Jessica play some video games, truth or dare, and hide an go seek.While playing truth or dare:"OK, mark truth or dare?" "Truth.""Do you like hanging out with me?""I love hanging out with you, your awesome!'' Mark says making Jessica blush a little." jess,truth or dare?""Dare!" Jessica says while doing a brave pose for laughs"Kiss me." Mark says as he stared into Jessica's eyes"Y-your joking, right?" No,I'm serious, I dared you and you have to do it. " mark saidJessica was blushing like crazy and so was mark. She puts her hand on his face and leans forward, placing a passionate kiss on the lips. She wanted it to pull away but she couldn't. What seemed like forever mark finally pulls away."Jess I really like you. I know its been a couple of days but I really like you." He says looking into her eyes"Mark I feel the same I just didn't know what to do." Jessica says as mark pulled her into a warm embrace"I was nervous too, so I figured that a dare would spark something." Mark saidJessica stayed the night at marks. They watched TV and layed in the couch together until the both fell asleep.(Authors note)I am having trouble with wattpad right now so it might be a couple of hours until my next up load.Yours truly ~RPG_MONKEY89
