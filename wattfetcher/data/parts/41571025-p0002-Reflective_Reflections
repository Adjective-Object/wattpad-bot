In fifth period History, Mr. Walker gave us an assignment to figure out why our RevRefs always want to come in our world. "No research," he said. "Just your own theory. Two pages, front and back, due by Friday. Use this class to create a rough draft. Have fun! "So what are you doing for it?" I whispered to Trevor, who was making a birthday card for his dad who manufactures chocolate frogs for a living. Dang, he's cute! "Well I'm saying that they want to help us somehow in this world. Improve our technology, clean up the earth, and so on." Trevor loved helping people. He always thought the best of someone. Too bad almost all of the 9th grade girls, as well as some guys who came out, liked him. "What are you doing?" "Uh, well... I haven't really thought about it." "It'll come to you." He smiled and then went back to his card. I thought and thought some more, but even with my working lunch with Lianne, Nathan, and Hubert, I couldn't think of anything. Except his dimples. And smile. And eyes. Get over yourself, Emma!
