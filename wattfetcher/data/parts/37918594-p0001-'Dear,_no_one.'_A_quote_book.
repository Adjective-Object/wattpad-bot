I want a boy who would hold my hand in line at the mall, JUST to make the other girls jealous.

I want someone who would sing to me at random moments, someone who is more goofy than romantic.

A boy who would throw stuffed animals at me when I'm acting dumb. Someone who would bet me kisses that he could beat me at old playstation games, but let me win any ways.

A guy who would make fun of me, just to hear my laugh.

He would play with my hair all the time, and surprise me with 25 cent rings. Someone I could share lollipops with. And someone to lay on a blanket with to count the stars.

We would buy tons of disposable cameras to take the silliest pictures of each other & squirt water guns at each other in the house.

But mostly.. one who would be my best friend & would never break my heart. He would just always make me smile.
