"Everyone should be awake now," Howard assumed. "Come on. Let's report to Dawn and see if we can find some new jobs."
"Ok."
She was in the same spot as the last time I saw her. Still talking to Keegan and Bryce.
"Back early?" she asked when she saw us.
"Rain," Howard explained.
"The rooms might get a little wet then," Dawn said. "We should go see if everyone's all right."
So we did. The winding pathways were becoming more familiar now. Big tunnel to the common room, then to the tunnel with the blue curtain. We came to the boys' dorm first. Everyone was awake now, staring at the dripping water from the ceiling.
Kai's face brightened up. "Dawn, what do we do about this? What do you normally do?" It was a little unlike Kai because usually, he wasn't one to ask for advice or help, and certainly not one to show signs of cluelessness.
"We leave it as it is," Dawn said a little harshly. "The beds are already out of the way of the cracks. The floor gets a little muddy but then everything dries."
"All right," he replied, with a look on his face that said, "What's up with her?"
"Keegan, stay here," commanded Dawn. "Once all of you are ready, Keegan will show you to the kitchens."
Keegan nodded and positioned himself in front of the entrance. I glanced around the room and my eyes fixed themselves on Finn. He was sitting on his bed, the bottom of the bunk bed, and looking at Dawn as she speaked.
I hated to admit it, but he looked flawless. How could a person look so impeccable after sleep?
"What's wrong with me?" I thought. I was the first to leave the room to go to the girls. The scenery and atmosphere had changed from our cramped office base to this fantasy of a camp, but I hoped that my feelings did as well, for the good of everyone.
