Whats takin kanny so long. We set this up at 2pm its now its 2:39. Oh well. I know hes probably doin somthing online like defending public rights and triggers or something. I love him and all but we have a big day ahead of us. I mean its our 3 year anniversary! Im supposed to be cool but you cant forget this stuff. I did the whole thing.


Kankri starts to walk out of the door yelling something inside the house before walking to the car.


"Vwhat took you so long Kanny?"


" 9h im s9 s9rry cr9nus. See karkat was saying s9me very triggering w9rds again s9 I had t9 talk to him. Then after s9me very triggering things were said 9nline and I c9uld n9t sit thier and see that happen t9 s9me p99r girl then..."


I cut him off by kissing him. " Look you took care of evweryfin so wvere all good nowv . Nowv lets get goin."


I then take off in my nice purple mustang with my aquarius sign on front in white print. I race to marios. One of kannys favorite restraunts.


" Cr9nus I did not excpet we w9uld 6e g9ing to this specific restraunt. Im s9rry if this is triggering but I w9uld dressed better"


I look to see kankri in his usual sweater with a nice black jacket over it. And with nice black dress pants.


"Babe, you are lookin hot. Now come on and lets go" I say closing my door and walking over to his opening it to let him out. I help him out and walk with him hand and hand to the door. Walking to the door ahead of him and opening it for him.


" why cr9nus, thank y9u. Do n9t find this triggering 6ut I c9uld have 9pened the d99r f9r myself. 6ut that was very gentleman like of y9u."


"Your vwelcome babe." Letting him in and winking. Kankri then blushes a little. I walk to the counter.


" hey darlin. A table for 2 reservwed under ampora." She shakes her head in a nod.

"Come this way mr. Ampora" she then leads me and kanny to our table in the far back of the restraunt.
