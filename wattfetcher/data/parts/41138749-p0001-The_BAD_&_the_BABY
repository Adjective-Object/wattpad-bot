"Knock,Knock,Knock"
I let out a shaky breathe as I finally gave in to the courage to knock on his door. The suspense of how he would react haunting me in the mere seconds it took him to open the door. Before I knocked, I have been having conflicting thoughts to just turn around and pretend I was never here. But I was, and saying that was meant to mean more. Not only was I here on his door step waiting for the presence of the most arrogant,selfish, cocky, self-absorbed bad boy I knew, but I was also pregnant.
