"Oh my god. Where's the fucking spider?"
"Its in our bunk in the corner."  He said before biting his lip and wiping a bit of cum off his face.
"Alright." I said and went up to the bunk and found the spider and quickly killed it. "There."
"You're the best." He said jumping into my arms, "Thank you."
I smiled, "I know I am."
He smiled, "I need your help with something else."
"And what's that?"
He grabbed my hand and slowly brushed it across the front of his jeans, "This."
I smirked, "I think I can help you out."
About ten minutes later and he was smiling at me and doing his jeans back up.
"Remember how earlier I said I don't like you anymore?" He said breathing heavily.
"Yeah why?"
"I change my mind. I  really like you and everything you've got to offer."
"Good because I like you a lot too, I like every single thing about you." I told him pushing some of his hair out of his face. He smiled at me before getting on his tip toes and kissing me softly.
"You're great, you know that?"
"Yeah I do but you're much better." I said caressing his cheek.
"Oh I don't know about that." He said smiling up at me.
"I do."
He kissed me again before pulling away, "I have to do some school work."
"But we were having so much fun." I whined.
"I know we were but I have to do this project." He sighed seeming somewhat annoyed.
"What's the project? Maybe I can help." I offered.
"I have to make a presentation on touring. About this trip and present it when I get back. Then my partner is grading my work. Then I'm doing the same for him but he has a different thing."
"You sound like you hate it." I said.
"I like the project just not my partner."
"What's wrong with your partner?"
"He's kind of my ex boyfriend."
"Are you serious?"
"Yes. I have to work with him on this and I don't want to." He said, "I'd rather not have anything to do with him."
"I wish you didn't have to. When you first told me about him I learned he was a complete ass who liked to control your life."
"Well he was and I hate him."
"Yeah I do too." I said, "I don't like you having to deal with him at all."
"I wish I didn't and speaking of him... I have to go call him."
"You have to talk with him to?"
"Yes I have to meet with him or Skype with him too..."
"What if he tries to get you back or something?" I asked wrapping my arms around him tightly.
"Don't worry. I'm not leaving." He said and kissed me. I kissed him back and held him a little closer.  He pushed me against the wall and grabbed my shirt kissing me harder. I pulled away a little and looked at him.
"What's gotten into you?" I asked before burying my face in his neck and kissing all over before sucking on his neck.
