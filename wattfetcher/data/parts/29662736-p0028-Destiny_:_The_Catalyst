NoDown below in hell... (Lucifer)
.
Lucifer stood and stared out into the darkness where soul's were being tortured. And from there cry's and fear he drew his power.
It is time for me to go to the surface world and take matters to my own hands. Is that so death asked. Death always stays with Lucifer, death was made by Lucifer's flash and than death made the angels of death, that would bring the souls from earth to hell.
What shall you do on earth, death asked. Im gonna take a human form and keep an eye out on the crucible. I just need to know where the catalyst rests.
But what about the crucible, death asked. I thought only the crucible can use it.
Yes it can but I have a different way of using it that does not require the mortal.
Oh I see, death grinned.
I shall befriend the mortal.
And how do you think you are gonna accomplish this task of befriending her.
I have a simple solution.
Death just nodded and went down .
Lucifer broke out his huge wings of destruction, once the wings were white and magnificent and now it's dark and dripping with dark energy.
He flew up top to the empty void and used his powers to summon forth a portal to the human world.
In momentous time he was in the human world, he was still in his true form. He stood in the middle of a field. All plants died and decayed result of his surfacing.
He closed his eyes and inhaled and soon the dark smoke that would come out of him stopped, his wings disappeared, human cloths appeared. His face remained the same only his appearance adapted to the humans, he opened his eyes showing that he had now blue  eyes than red and chaotic.
He walked over to the nearest bus stop. In his human form he had lost a lot of his powers, but it was something that he had to do in order to get what he wants.
He got on the transport and sat at the back. He knew that he will not go to the crucible where it is yet. So he set his journey to the one place that they will meet soon, New York
