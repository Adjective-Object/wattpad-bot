maria P.O.VSo I lied to Jake its not a bad thing he left us when I needed him most. I woke up the next morning and in the shower and started sing away you love me by Jessica ware. After my shower I got dressed in white skinny jeans and red obey shirt and curled my hair and did my make up. I walked to the door and put my need vans on and drove to matts house.Matt's P.O.VI got Jason up and dressed because maria was coming to get him she loves like 29 minutes from me. I feed him and waited I have alwayed love maria she just doesn't know it yet. I went to get dressed when I heard Jason singing a song I could never forget his mom song this song every time it came on the radio when she was pregnant it was life of the party by Shawn mendes. I smiled st him and got dressed today was the DAT I'm gonna ask Maria out I have always been here for here and Jason needs a dad. She pulled up and I ran to the door.Unknown P.O.VI saw my girl with that thing she will be mine again. I promise she will. I have a plan to kidnap that thing she calls her son and the only way she will get him back is if she marrys me.Maria P.O.VI walked up to the door and did something I been waiting to do I kissed Matt our lips moved in sync so perfect I felt a spark something I have never felt with Jack. I pulled away and looked in Matt's eyes he smiled and wisphered I been wanted to do that. I said you didn't do that I did we both giggled and he asked me to his princess and I said yes we kissed and I decides to stay there with Jason for a while we sat on the couch and Jason came and sat in my lap and kissed my cheek and feel asleep. Matt was fliping threw the channels when so one knocked.
