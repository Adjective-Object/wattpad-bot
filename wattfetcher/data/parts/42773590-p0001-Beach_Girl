I was sifting through the sand for seashells,when my mom called me."Rachel!Time to go!"I had found 4 big seashells,and 11 small ones.It had been only 4 months since my father,sister,and 2 brothers had died.I was bringing seashells to their grave.It was hard for mom and me,mom didn't have a good job,and hardly got paid.We went to the beach every day.I loved it.Until one day,I woke up before mom, and that had never happened before.I looked in her room, and she had left me a note,"Had to go to work early,you can watch television."So I watched t.v. After 4 hours, I got a telegram,mom had died at work.I didn't know what to do!should I go to an orphanage?Should I get a job?Should I go visit her funeral?so I prayed. I prayed for hours.That God would protect me and tell me what to do.After all, my mom was dead.
