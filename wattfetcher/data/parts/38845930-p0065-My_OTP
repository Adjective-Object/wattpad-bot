"Okay... I guess believe you." He said.
"I should have come home." I sobbed.
"Or called me from the phone there to tell me you were staying." He said.
"Yes, or I shouldn't have stayed at all. I can't believe I did this." I said.
"Let's just try and forget it." He said.
"Okay." I said in agreement.
"I can't believe this." He said.
"I'm sorr -- "
"Are you?" He asked.
"Yes... I don't know what I would do without you, how to tell Boo we had to move again. I can't believe myself, this is such a -- a something! I can't even think anymore, I don't know." I said trying not to drown us in tears, my chest was soaked already.
"I'd miss you... for sure." He said.
"I wish this never happened, we'd be fine." I said.
"I wish you would have called." He said.
"You know his number, you wouldn't have picked up." I said.
"I might have." He said.
"You're right, you are completely right, Jordan." I said in an attempt to apologize.
"Do you have all your stuff?" He asked.
"Yes, I have everything I need... right here, it's you... you know?" I asked.
"Get your stuff, you don't even have your phone." He said.
"Okay, I'm going now, please don't leave without me."
"I won't." He sighed.
I got my stuff and went straight to the car without saying bye to Boo, I'm not sure she wanted to say goodbye after hearing the entire fight.
"I'm sorry." I said as I got back in the car.
