"I don't know, guys, I'm scared..." Scott grunted.
"Aw, don't worry about it, youse'll be fine." Chicken assured him.
"Sha-yeah." Lightning agreed.
"But you guys don't know that guy like I do," Scott said to them, still kind of dreading meeting Jade's grandfather. "My pappy knows him!"
"Scott, I knew Tumbleweed Tex right before me and Cow got a short turned into a series!" Chicken insisted. "Trust me, you should be fine."
"I hope you're right..."
"But I will tell you this, don't mention about his school... Otherwise, he'd probably go nuts."
"I heard that teacher he had hates his and constantly hit him, but she did favor that little Timmy brat."
"Who's Timmy?" Lightning asked.
"We'll tell ya later." Scott and Chicken told him.
"But I'll tell you... That teacher was kinda hot..." Chicken laughed a little.
"Careful dude," Scott jokingly warned. "Otherwise she might find something to hit you with."
"So, who's Timmy?" Lightning still wanted to know.
"Seriously, you think I'm ready for this?" Scott asked his friends, still very anxious.
"Man please, I think you've been ready this whole time." Chicken soothed.
"You think I can do this?"
"Yeah, yeah! Man, now go in there and get the woman of your dreams!"
Scott went over and smiled as he saw his crush.
"Howdy Scott, ready to go?" Jade smiled.
"Yeah, umm... Let's go and meet your grandpa."
And with that, Scott and Jade went off together.
"There goes one lucky guy." Chicken smiled in admiration.
"Seriously, who's Timmy?" Lightning asked, still struggling.
Chicken merely rolled his eyes at him.
