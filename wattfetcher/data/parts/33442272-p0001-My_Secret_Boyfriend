Zayn had just wedged his way through my small spaces window and was now sitting on my bed laughing with me. It's five in the morning and foot steps are coming their way down hall.
'Clara. Honey are you awake what's going on?' My mothers innocent voice asks from the end of the hall.
'Shoot! They can't know your here! Quick through the window.' I shove him towards the window. His back is right at the window.
'Okay but first,' he quickly pecks me on the lips and climbs out the window but my door is opening right as he is still here so I give him a shove and I here a tumble.
'Whaaahh!' I hear a screech. I swiftly turn around just in time to see my mother and father standing there.
'What's going on?' My father asks.
'I uh. Couldn't sleep. I was just getting some air.' I stammer.
'Is that why the window is open?' My mother asks curiously. I nod.
Please buy it! Please believe it!
I say In my head. They still look a little unsure but they nod.
'Please try and get some sleep,' my mother kisses the top of my head and both my parents exit the room. I turn around and peer out into the darkness of the night.
'Zayn! Zayn!' I whisper loudly.
'Down here!' He yells. I look directly down to see him stuck in a bush.
I start laughing quietly.
'Get outta there you doof!' My laughing dies down a little.
'I can't I'm stuck!' He struggles a little bit and the sight make me laugh harder.
'Okay okay I'll be right down.' I carefully put one of my feet out the window and then my head. Once my full body's out of the window I slowly climb down the tree.
He sticks out his large hand and I grab it pulling with all my might. He squirmed and kicked and eventually got out.
'Now go! I'll see you tomorrow.' I said and he scurried off and I went up the tree and into my room.
Zayn Malik, is my secret boyfriend.
