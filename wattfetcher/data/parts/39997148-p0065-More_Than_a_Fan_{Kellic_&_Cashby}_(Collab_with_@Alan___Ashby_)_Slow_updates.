"Don't care, you're in trouble."
"Ugh."
"Its not like I'm gonna keep you from going on stage." He said, "Now shush I'm trying to take pictures.
"Fine." I muttered.  About ten minutes before my set he let me leave and man the guys were pissed when I got back there.
"Where have you been?" Aaron demanded as soon as he saw me.
"I'm in trouble with Alan so I was with him."
"Wow you've been together for like a week and you're already in trouble." Phil said laughing.
"Don't laugh at me."
"So was he pissed?" Tino asked.
"He's pissed off. He's everything that means that same as pissed." I told him.
"What'd you even do?" Aaron asked me.
"You'll find out in our next interview."
"Its Austin, he makes plenty of mistakes." Tino said, "Now lets go on."
"Alright let's do this."
About halfway through our set we had just finished O.G. Loko and I looked down at my boyfriend who was taking pictures. He looked absolutely adorable down there and I felt like such a dick. I can't believe he didn't break up with me as soon as I told him.
I smiled and looked out at the crowd of kids, "How is everyone doing tonight?"  I smiled as everyone started to cheer.  "So as most of you know by now there this picture going around of me kissing this ginger." I looked down at Alan who had stopped taking pictures and was staring up at me wide eyed. "We haven't really been together for too long but I really like him. I mean he's fucking amazing and he's kind of our photographer for this tour." Alan blushed and looked around as people let out loud aws. "I know but, I kinda screwed up today in an interview and said something really stupid. I mean it was really, really stupid. But I really want to fix it."  I looked back at Alan and walked to the edge of the stage and held my hand out to him, "Will you come up here with me?"  He shook his head blushing like crazy, "Oh come on babe, come up here so they can all see how cute you are!"
"Fine." He said taking my hand and letting me help him up on stage with him.
"Everyone this is Alan and the guy I screwed things up with in barely a week." I told everyone, "And surprisingly he didn't break up with me because of it."
"Yeah but you are so dead after this." He muttered.
"I know, but I really just want to tell you I'm sorry. That I'm a completely and utter idiot who really fucking likes you." I said to him, "So everyone this song is for Alan and it's called This One's for You." I kissed Alan just as the music started.
After the song ended he kissed me once more before walking off and we went on with the show till it was over. It went amazing I'd say. As soon as I walked off stage Alan launched himself at me squealing.
"Austin you are so fucking adorable." He said and kissed me.
"I know, have you seen me." I said pulling away from him.
"Don't get cocky." He said rolling his eyes, "That was absolutely embarrassing going up there but it was also the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me."
I smiled and kissed him again before pulling away, "Does this mean I'm not in trouble anymore?"
"Oh no you still are but not as much as before." He said, "Now hold my camera stuff for me."
