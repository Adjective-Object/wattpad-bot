Okay. Step one. Wrap things up quickly. Skip the details unless asked. Don't linger. Step two. Say goodbye simply. "I'm sorry I'm doing this. Goodbye. I love you."Step three. Add this in with step two if you wish. Just piss everyone off. Make them mad. Then they won't be sad. Step four. Tell your parents you don't feel well and you're going to bed. Step five. Wait till 11 or later. Step six. Follow through. They won't find you until the morning when everything is already over.
