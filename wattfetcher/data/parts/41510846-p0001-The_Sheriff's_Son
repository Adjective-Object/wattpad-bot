"Mom, Mom I'm home. Where are you? ". I couldn't find her. I figured that she just had an appointment and forgot to tell me. I went to the kitchen to get my afternoon snack, then I went upstairs to do my homework. When I got to my room there was blood everywhere, next to my bed there was my mom while our neighbour Tom was on top of her. Was he.. was he eating her? I told him to stop, but all he did was look at me and start to chase me. I ran down the hallway to my mother's room where my bow and arrows were. I aimed at him as he stumbled into the room as if he were drunk.          I shot him in the chest with one arrow but he still came at me, I didn't have enough time to reload. He tackled me to the floor. There was an arrow in my hand, not knowing what to do with it completely I jabbed it into his skull. He dropped to the floor with a thud. I grabbed my arrows and ran straight to my mother.           I knew she was going to die."Mom, Mom please don't leave me I don't know what to do, or what's going on. I love you " I said as the tears came running down. "I love you to Faith, but you have to stay strong. You know what to do. Don't be scared" she said with her last dying breath.          I woke up, I don't think I will ever forget that day. I was covered in sweat and tears which I really don't know the difference anymore. I climbed down the tree I was staying in, when I saw a squirrel climb up the tree in front of me. I got down on one knee and aimed but before I could shoot there was already an arrow in the squirrel.           I looked around ready for anyone out there when a man came out from behind a tree. "Hey you stole my breakfast I hope you know" I said half joking half serious. He turned and pointed his crossbow at me. "Hey, I was just kidding, you can put that down now" I told him as he lowered his crossbow, not entirely but enough. "Who are you? " he asked me. "Faith Parker " I said. "How old are you and where are your parents?" jesus he must really like asking questions but anyway I was nice and said " I'm 14 and. .." then I realized the second part of the question. My parents. "My dad walked out on me and my mom when I was little and my mom. .. she didn't make it " it was the first time I spoke about my mother in front of someone other than myself and surprisingly I didn't cry.          He nodded and said "We have a group at a prison, do you want to come?"
