Coveted by the secrecy of darkness, the comfort of two entwined  Brought together by the cold, frigid world outside One simple act of touch would start to ruin everything Everything we thought we wanted, thought we needed Fought to attain, now begins with the first hairline fracture splintering into  A spider web on the glass, glistening with our beautiful fa√ßade
Since then, events have changed, we have changed Transformed into a newer evolution of ourselves toned and charmed from reality From the heartbreak of one lover, of another, harshness of life Cruelty has hardened me, ruin has bettered me Ruin and lust caused my tie to you, made me push you away Yet despite all I've done, here you stay with me Although I thought I knew what I wanted, what I needed While I slept with each man, rested in his arms there was always one thought One name, one face, one embrace that I found myself void of Yours You, who accept me, all of me, understand me, love me For all that I am and that I am not, there was always you that had me The moment our lips met, so long ago in the dark beneath the cold Time passed, the longing built, I found myself nearly infatuated We seemed closer suddenly, able to comprehend, understand Just as we did those first few months coming to realize one another Fumbling fingers dial numbers, a trembling wrist struggles to stay still as I talk We speak, we laugh, suddenly lighthearted murmurs, truths revealed Emotions tumbling in confessional words, unveiling the long endured severance  Once again we were mended, two souls that never understood one another better Locked hand in hand, staring eye to eye, cards lain out on the table The move was neither mine nor yours to make But for the two of us to grab hold and blindly plunge into the future Lain out for us
Months and months, I think it's been five now, beside your side I've stayed Years longer if one wants the true tally, it matters naught All that is important, sacred, is that I keep you to me, bound by the  Servitude that is devotion of one soul to another  Together the both of us have learnt more than ever imagined Becoming closer and closer with each passing moment, each passionate embrace The bond strengthening to a near tangible love that remains unseen Unspoken we stand, united we fall against the bed sheets Bodies and hands entwined, breaths skipped, heartbeats in unison Moments of pure ecstasy heightening that undeniable connection that constantly pulls us Even as I lay against you, you against me, tender strokes of flesh against flesh There was fear, a thickening in the throat of the want to stay, to run While I could've easily done it, I knew it to be impossible I would somehow run straight back to you
One night, I crave for one more time, to be lost in those memories, forgotten to reality How I yearn for the next moment that I may hold you, bury my face in your neck Inhale your sweet scent, memorizing every aspect of the little details Smallest, the deduction of whom you are, to remember, indulge in memory alone As I lie awake at night, eyes shut, mind splayed openly to interweave in the vast Mind Palace teaming with conundrums, tortured with the tease of not having That single night, impulsive love, succumbing to carnal desire I thought it to be enough to last me, to satisfy me, much longer than it has now As I lay in my bed, I can still feel you, caress you Phantom fingers glide across my body where you once touched, lips sore from battling yours Single tears can even prick my cold heart as I suppress every urge to thrust myself back to you But I cannot, I must refrain from such an obscene notion Just for now, I shall humour myself, play with the pretty pretending that September Will not come, that it imaginary, nonexistent That it will be skipped, ignored, no one will notice as I fade to the future Slipping back to you As sweet as that is, it is illogical, improbable, so as it were, I shall close my eyes, hold my breath Retreat to you when fate allows, reclining into your arms, the bliss Close my eyes, shut off my mind to September You and I, darling, love, lover You and I shall settle back into the shadows of momentary paradise Entwine our hands, legs, bodies and arms Hot breath against one another, eyes closed to verify the dream Earn every inch of your body Savour what we hold dear, sacred So that we may smile, laugh and look to the ever clear sky, brushing off the imaginary Indulge in the time that we have left, kiss you goodbye each and every time Promise me, just promise me, that you will remember Those hours spent so close Promise me, do not dare humour me, in what once was Hold my hand, own my breathing, brush your lips on my brow, murmur my name That every time I leave your warm grasp these words will linger in your mind; "We have until September" Before we uncover if this shall fall apart.
