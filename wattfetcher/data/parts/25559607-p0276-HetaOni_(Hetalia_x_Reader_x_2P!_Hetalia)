"Oh, that sounds good to me. I don't want to stick with you all the time, and if each one goes where he likes, we can tell each other about the places we searched later." Russia told them, smiling his usual smile.



Tears started to stream down Past Italy's cheeks. "Don't!!--!"


"What? Why are you crying? It's the best way! If we huddle together to look-" Past America tried to convince him.


Past Germany huffed in annoyance. " You're the only one who's opposed to it. what are you so scared of? I'm sorry but I'm going now." he told Past Italy as he began walking down the left hall.


"Germany!! I told you not to go there! Don't go to the basement!!" Past Italy cried out.

Past China frowned a bit. "I'm going, too. Let's meet again here in one hour." he told them as he walked down the right hall.

"I'll start looking over there~" Past Russia said, following Past China.


Past Italy looked back and forth from the two halls. "Wait! Don't split up!!" he tried to call after his friends.


"Okay, I'll start on the top most floor!" Past America informed them.


Past Japan nodded. "Then I suppose I will start on the second floor."


Past America and Past Japan walked up the stairs together, leaving Italy alone in the center hall.


"Wait-Japan!! America!! If you do that, then it was pointless to go back in time--..." Past Italy tried to call out, but stopped when he realised that it was already too late.


His eyes darkening, Past Italy lowered his head and spoke in a low voice. "...Now I'll have to go through it all over again. Now that we've already got in, we can't leave until we get the key. First Japan, then China, Russia, and France. America, England and Canada are still fine. The basement is dangerous, too. I'll call Germany back, and if we go with Japan..."


"I'll have to put on an act. This time, I'll save all of them. Even if I have to trick them, I'm going to save them..." Past Italy decided.
