Pete's POV
How to start to help Soph? I have no idea. Maybe finding out why? Would she tell me though? Worth a shot.
Soph and I got in the car where Meagan was sat waiting to leave, she'd already strapped Saint in and he was asleep; yet again.
"MJ, instead of taking Soap back to mom and dad's, can we just go straight home please?" I could feel Soph's eyes staring into the side of me, almost confused.
"Why would I ever have a problem with that?!" She smiled.
"Love you Meagan."
"As do I with you."
"GET A ROOM YOU TWO!" Soph made her prescence truly known for the first time today and it warmed me inside.
"Our car missy, don't get cocky!" Meagan laughed back to her.
The ride home was full of laughter and jokes and happiness and it was so much fun I was almost sad to get home.
We pulled into the driveway and hopped out of the car. Quickly strolling over to Meagan, I whispered to her, "I need to talk to Soph on her own, you don't mind do you?"
"Of course I don't."I pulled her into me for a hug and then stood on my toes to kiss her forehead. Damn that girl for being taller than me. My son had woken up and was screaming from his car seat so I unclipped it and lifted him high above my head and bounced him, to which his response was to giggle hysterically.
As we walked into the lounge, I placed him down in his play pen and tapped Soph on the shoulder. I slowly walked towards the stairs and beckoned her to follow me. Sitting her down on the bed in the guest room, I perched myself next to her and held her hand in a caring way.
"Soap, what's going on with you?"
