You check your phone again. Why isn't Mr.Hudson calling you? He told you that he would ring before noon. 13:23 (1:23), and you're still waiting for the old man to call you back. You were going to check out the apartment before you decided to move in. 221c, Baker Street. You moved away from your small town after your parents kicked you out for liking girls. Hopefully London will be kinder.
You pull out a magazine and wait. Oh, look at that! A local cab driver was arrested for murder. That reminded you of the time when you--oh look at that. It's Mr. Hudson.
"Hello!" He yelled from across the street. "I thought you were going to call!" You yelled back. He ran over to you and smiled. "What was that dear?" He said in a friendly tone. "You said you'd call at noon. It's no problem seeing as you're here now though." You say, trying to make a good first impression. He smiled. "My phone battery turned off. It's charging. I apologise y/n." He said.
You make small talk for a while and you find out that a detective named Sherlock Holmes lives above you. "What's he like?" You ask the landlord. "Sherlock is a girl. Lives with her girlfriend Jane. Cute couple they are, only problem is Jane says she isn't gay." Mr. Hudson laughed. "Wait till you hear their conversations! It's better than TV. Sometimes I just sit on the couch and listen to them." He says. You must have shown a bit of worry because he immediately clears himself up. "Not in a creepy way. In a sort of father checking up on their daughter while with a boyfriend. I guess in this case, girlfriend." He said defensively. He sure was a talker. "It sounds funny." You say. "We can't just stand around here all day! C'mon, I'll show you the flat."
The wallpaper looked creepy, but in the best way. It was a darkly lit room and it was larger than expected. "Ok, I'll take it." You say, proudly looking at the flat. "Right this way to the papers." He gave you some documents and you looked over them. Signing each one as you go. "When should I move in?" You ask. "Well it's your flat now innit? Anytime you'd like."
Just then, you heard a loud bang upstairs. "Sherlock! What have I told you about the wall?" You heard a girl yell. "Not to shoot it. Jane I'm bored. I need a case. Get me a case!" You heard another woman call. That must be Sherlock. "You're right. It is funny!" You say to Mr. Hudson. "Why don't you meet the neighbours?" He said. You unpacked the suit case and left the clothes on the floor. Mr. Hudson had a couch you could borrow for the week. He was a nice landlord.
You knocked on the door. "Come in!" A blonde young woman said. She was quite pretty. "Hello, you must be Jane!" You say, holding out your hand. Jane shakes it and smiles. Yes it is. And you are?" She asks. "Y/n l/n." You say. "Ah yes, y/n, Sherlock, come say hello." She says to a woman with cheekbones and long black hair. It was slightly wavy and she was very beautiful. "H-hello." You stutter. "Hello y/n," she says with a silky voice. "You moved into the downstairs apartment I presume?" She asks. "I did."
"We will be getting to know each other quite well. I'm sure of it."
