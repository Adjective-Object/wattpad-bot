My poetry is me.
I am my poetry.
It has shaped me.
"Art is risk"
And if there's one piece of advice I give you,
Let it be:
Keep dreaming.
Go there.
Dive in all the fucking way
And never stop dreaming.
Let nothing hold you back.
You are worth more than everything holding you back put together.
You can do anything.
