My words are silent
My thoughts are loud
The world grumbles and shakes
A million people pull apart the ground
I seep through the cracks
That are marked on my skin
The air seems so heavy
But the oxygen is thin
I gasp for breath
But no one car hear
My shrill shrieks
This is a world I cannot possibly bare
