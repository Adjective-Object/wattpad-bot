Merry Christmas, guys!
'Tis the season to read some HetaOni? Falalalalalalala---(heavy panting from running from Steve in the distance)...
Well, this will be my (last?) post for the week. Not yet sure if I'll be able to post part 4 sometime this week...because I have well, plans with family, friends and church. I'm going to attend the Ozine Fest at SM Megamall this Saturday, too~ (an anime convention from where I'm from)...
I still don't know if I'll try cosplaying as Nyo! Italy, Mio from K-ON. or...just plain casual xD hahaha yeah.

About this chapter part:
*This a really important part of the series because this is one of the many revelations by the reader. As you can see, you (reader) are feeling a bit doubtful about giving away information... I wonder why?
*I also really like this chapter part because it shows how it's not just Japan and the reader who's going through a lot and thinking of various things on their troubled minds.
*There are so much that is known...but there is also so much that is unknown.
*If you guys are able to piece it together, I've been leaving some hints about the reason why they're in the mansion, why reader's always fainting, and what are the important elements in the story... If you guys still don't get it--you will in time!~ :)
* I also love this part of the story because of Prussia! He's really witty, brave and sweet here~ I hope everyone would stop stereotyping him as a big perv or something---because girls, he's our babbyyy!! ;w;
~~Anyways, MERRY CHRISTMAS!!~
Chapter 7 part 4 will be posted soon!~ :3
