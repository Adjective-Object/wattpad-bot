Samantha nodded. "And she's my girlfriend as of today. She's brilliant and amazing and I'm so glad she's on this movie and so so glad she agreed to go out with a stubborn weirdo like me." Johnny said. He never took his eyes off of her. "The rest you can ask her yourself." Johnny finished. Samantha blushed. Johnny leaned over and kissed her. Cameras went wild as Samantha raised her hand to his cheek. When johnny pulled away, he took her nervousness with her.
"Miss. Hoffman, what is it like to get the lead in a big movie and get the star of the movie at the same time?" Someone asked.
"Uh I'm still trying to figure out the whole thing with johnny so I'll get back to you on that. No no I'm just joking. To get johnny and this role is a dream come true and I don't plan on wasting any moment of either." Samantha said. The questions kept getting fired at the two. But with johnny by her side, Samantha knew she could handle whatever the media threw at her.
