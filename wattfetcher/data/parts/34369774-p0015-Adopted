I looked up to see my only friend that supported me and stayed. Besides Amanda of course. Venus. She was just like me. I swear we had the same parents because of how alike we were. "OH MY GOODNESS IT REALLY IS YOU!!!!" I smiled and hugged when she came over to me. She never knew what happened to me. "Umm. Lisa who is this?" I looked at Harry who was staring at her with a hint of interest in his eye. I should've known. I just pointed at her then back to me repeatedly. "Your close?" I nodded. Venus looked confused as to why I didn't talk. We knew each other since diapers and since we learned to talk she learned I never shut up and always crack jokes to make people laugh. She apparently has a brother that she never met because he was always traveling. I never bothered learning her last name or her parents name. I didn't have to. I called her my last name and her parents mom and dad. I never really had a chance to look at them because whenever I went over to her house, straight to her room we'd go. Anyways enough about background check. "She doesn't talk because of her past. Me and the lads are trying to figure out what happened." What? No they didn't. "Really. OH MY GOODNESS!! So what did you find out?" "Nothing. The adoption center knew nothing." Oh, okay so he went to the adoption center. After meeting up the rest of the boys, I mostly hanged out with Niall because Harry was flirting his lips off with Venus, Zayn was looking at mirrors and hair products, Liam wanted to relax a little before having to deal with the boys again, and Louis, I just couldn't find him to find out what he was doing. The boys thought after an hour of everyone doing what they wanted, I could go get things that's I probably wanted. There were a few but not a lot. Right now we are stuffing our faces. Awesome.
