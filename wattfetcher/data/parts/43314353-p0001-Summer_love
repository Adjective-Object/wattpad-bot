Macks POV
Im walking out the door of Starbucks when a boy runs into me, spilling my coffee all over me. "I'm so clumsy, let me buy you another" the boy said, "no its all m self I should have been watching, you don't have to buy me one I'm fine." I looked down to wipe my shirt and when I looked up he was in Starbucks buying me a coffee. When he gave it to me I said thank you, and I have to go now. He said "can I have your number first?" "Of course." After I gave him my number I walked away blushing.
