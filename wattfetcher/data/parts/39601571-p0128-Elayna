So I already did this on one of my vine accounts but I didn't do all my friends so I'll just do it on here and send them pictures because why not? I'll do some WattPad friends too.____________________________
MM: your like one of my closest friends on vine😭 we've been through thick and thin. I can't believe that you got 11k too😱 that's so crazy! I remember when you were just at 100😌 I'm really happy to call you my best friend and we should do a collab again soon💞 your crazy pretty too😘💙
❤️Cute Yulema❤️: your edits are like the bomb.com😂 me and you have been friends for......like a month? I want to say😂 we haven't talked much but your still super cool✌️ I hope you did good on that project you were working on to😂💘
BBF: your crazy perfect! Me and you have been through so much! It's crazy😭 I don't even know what to say about you. I can honestly say that you've been here for me more than anyone else has. (You and Lizzie) I am more comfortable telling you my life story and everything than people in reality. People that I've known for years. You have been there for me more than my closest friends in real life through out the years. We live SO far away but I feel so close to you. I'm hoping that your doing okay with everything that's going on😔☁️. I know a whole lot has been happening with you. We were just talking yesterday but it feels like years have gone by since we last talked. Me and you are the kind of Internet friends that talk everyday😊 and I'm happy about that💘
KM: your just flipping great. Me and you have been through pretty good times. I'm just really happy to be friends with you even though we don't talk too much.💞☁️
TBHN: your really pretty😍 just wanted to throw that out there😂 also I'm so happy that you decided to dye your hair! 😱. It's going to look crazy good! I'm not going to say what color you did it because I want it to be a surprise😊 I know a vine friend reads this (😉) hahahahhaha I can't wait to talk to you soon!
CN: your account is really great! I just talk to you so I'm just going to stop there😂
Abbyfinally : first off, I just wanted to say your crazy beautiful. Your one of the nicest people I have come to meet. I know that you've been going through a lot lately and I just want you to know that I'm here for you. You can talk to me on here, or text me. Ever. I don't care if it's a big thing or a small thing. Your a really good writer and an amazing friend. An amazing person in general. When I found out that you were deactivating that one time I was crushed. You said that there was a lot going on and I felt so bad. I felt like it was my fault. I talked to you and found out what happened. I still feel like it's my fault because I wasn't there for you. I feel like shit, still. When you see this can you actually text me? I really want to talk to you. I just want it to be more private. But your crazy beautiful and please don't ever forget that. 😌💞😘 don't forget to text me please!💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙

aliensarereal001 : I know you personally. We went to school together for 3-4 years. Your one of my best friends to this day! The stuff that me and you have been through is mind blowing. We had our laughs. To where we turned red and couldn't breath. We had our fights. Where we turned red and was out of breath from yelling😂 from experience I think we both need anger management and go to a mental hospital.😂😂😂😫😫😫. Remember when we were walking? 🙊👀 I'm laughing really hard right now. But your such a good friend and I hope you stay like that💘 (oh and my bad I stopped texting you😂 I was watching the Joe series again😂 in my defense I'm done with it now✊ but fun fact about me- I've liked him more and longer than Nash😱) crazy twist😂____________________________________________________
I'm done now😊 I missed a wattpad friend (Juli-The-Fangirl ) sorry about that. But I don't I so if we're still friends :/ your really confusing me. Inbox me when you see this.💞💘☁️
I did most of my vine friends on vine but not all of them so I finished on here😂 I'll be sending pictures to them📷. I just didn't want to cause any confusion.
I'm going to go do something to keep me busy now. So bye✌️😂
Should I do another Q&A?
