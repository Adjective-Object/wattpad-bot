Millie sat there and cried on Aya's shoulders.

She remembered. She remembered the pain and humiliation she suffered for 7 years and the grief and sadness of the other three.

Her life has truly been messed up.

"I can't."
"Huh?"

"I can't. I can't show them the mark."

Aya was a bit concerned at the Princess' rather queer outburst. The guards rushed in but Aya shoo-ed them away.

"It was ten years ago."

Entering a flashback.....about 15 yrs ago.....

"Sayo-nee, Gemi-nii. Let's go!" Millie called waving to her siblings. At that time, Twilight did not have her devil fruit powers.

"Hai!"

"Wait..come back here.. You're supposed to be studying!"

"We don't wanna." The siblings teased sticking out their tongues and making faces. Their tutor twitched his eyebrows in annoyance. He must report this to the King and Queen.

"KIng Leo, Queen Miriam. You must control your kids." The tutor complained once again. The royal couple merely looked at him with a smile.

"They're children. Let them be!"

"But your highness, "

"They're probably playing in the royal Candy Cane Garden. Go look for them there."

"Sir-Sirrah!" One guard yelled, barley being able to keep himself on the harden marshmellow floor.

"At ease, soldier what is it?" The King asked immediately getting up from his seat. Queen Miriam ran towards and caught the fallen soldier as she started to heal him.

"Si-irrah, One of the Celestial Dragons....THEY ARE HERE!!! THE CELESTIAL DRAGONS ARE HERE?!!!!"

"NANI?"
