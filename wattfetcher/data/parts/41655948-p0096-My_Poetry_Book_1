I knew I loved you. And it just kept occurring to me; It's not like I could forget, though. It just washed over me in waves. I felt it the night before you temporarily left, Or the countless infinities we had, staying up past 1. I felt it the night of no sleep, And the day you called me when I was a train wreck, and you wanted to help. It's always present in the air- The atmosphere. I am in love with you, In a way that makes me dream of the stars and Not want to sleep. - (m.m)
