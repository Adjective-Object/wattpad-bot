The next day I stayed home from school. I got to sleep in again for the second day in a row and didn't have to worry about being late for my scenes. Bianca and I were hanging out after lunch and she would get to meet Robert. Thankfully she wasn't the type of person to scream when meeting a celebrity, or else I would forbid her to even go near him.
When I eventually got up, I got dressed and went downstairs for breakfast, or lunch by that time. I quickly ate and waited for my best friend to show up.
"This is weird," My brother whispered to me.
"What is?"
"Having a celebrity in our house."
"Hey, soon enough you'll have one everyday."
"Don't remind me," He grumbled and walked away. Bianca soon arrived and she dropped her stuff off in my room. I then brought her to the living room to introduce her to Robert.
"Robert," I got his attention, "this is my best friend Bianca. Bianca, this is Robert."
"It's a pleasure to meet you," Bianca put out her hand. He accepted it with a smile and greeted her back.
"So you're the Bianca I keep hearing about."
"Yup, that's me."
"Well it's nice to meet you." We said goodbye and we went back upstairs. Instead of going in my room, we went into my studio next door. My studio was basically like a recording studio, just not as equipped. It held all my instruments and was soundproof, which my family was thankful for. Even though I didn't play every instrument, I had them in there so Bianca could play them when she was over.
"What are we playing today my friend?" She asked.
"I don't know. What do you want to do?"
"I got an idea," She smirked. She told me to sit at the piano as she grabbed her acoustic. She sat down next to me and began to sing. I caught on to the song and began to play the piano.
It's getting late, and ICannot seem to find my way home tonightFeels like I am falling down a rabbit holeFalling for forever, wonderfully wandering aloneWhat would my head be likeIf not for my shouldersOr without your smileMay it follow you foreverMay it never leave youTo sleep in the stone,May we stay lost on our way home
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around meI'd like to believe in all the possibilities
She joined in on her guitar and I began to sing.
If I should die tonightMay I first just say I'm sorryFor I, never felt like anybodyI am a man of many hats although INever mastered anythingWhen I am ten feet tallI've never felt much smaller, since the fallNobody seems to know my nameSo don't leave me to sleep all aloneMay we stay lost on our way home?
Both:C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around meI'd like to believe in all the possibilities (x2)
Bianca:Try not to mistake what you have with what you hateIt could leave, it could leave, come the morning
Me:Celebrate the night It's the fall before the climbShall we sing, shall we sing, 'til the morning
Bianca:If I fall forward, you fall flat
Both:And if the sun should lift me upWould you come back? C'mon!
