In just a matter of seconds we were a mess of whipped cream and laughter rolling on the ground.
"Uh hum." Someone in the distance cleared their throat. Momentarily we stopped laughing and looked at the door way to find Zach with his arms crossed and Colin by his side, a big goofy grin plastered on his face. Colin's grin was so freaking cute that it should be illegal not just in America, but all around the world.
Trying to act serious, Zach shook his head. "What am I going to do with you two?"
I looked up at Cheri and she looked down at me. We both started giggling again.***Hey guys!Sorry I haven't updated in forever but I wanted to do this chapter from Sam's POV because he's gay and GUESS WHAT? IT IS NOW LEGAL IN ALL FIFTY STATES TO BE GAY AND HAVE GAY MARRIAGE. America finally did something right. I'm so happy but yeah it's finally happened!!!
