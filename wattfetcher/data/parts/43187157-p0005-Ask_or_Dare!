Me: we have another dare...from Cougarheart and Silverheart. It says...I dare you to race me and my son around the territory.
Sunstar: he's gone mad! We can't keep up like that-! (starts coughing up blood)
Emberpaw: father! Your sick! (Gasps) Let Thistlepaw and I race them! We can take your places, and we can keep up!
Thistlepaw: yeah! We can take 'em! Lets go!
Me: (gasps) NO! I'm going alone.
Sunstar: you can't run, y-your leg! (Hacks) It's still broken!
Me: I'm not about to lose a race to some mangy piece of crowfood and his son! (Runs over to you and Silverheart) let's do this.
Silverheart: wait! Aren't you in need of a partner?
Me: I won't need one.
Cougarheart: (digs claws into the ground) what are you waiting for, kittypet?!
Silverheart: father, we shouldn't be calling her names, not since she oh-so graciously let us join for a while! (Growls sternly, then looks to me) I'm sorry. He's very competitive. Anyways...would you like a head start? Because of...you know...your leg?
Me: oh you don't have to. If I lose, I lose.
(After the race)
Cougarheart and Silverheart: (waiting at the "finish line", while I strugglers make it there with my injured leg)
Cougarheart: we won!
Silverheart: father, she might be hurt!
Me: no, I'm fine, dear! I'm just not the cat I used to be... (makes it to the finish line and falls on my side, panting) I'm never doing that again. Ever.
