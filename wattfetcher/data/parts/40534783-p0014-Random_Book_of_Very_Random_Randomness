If you are going to use one of MY ideas of a book I have made, ASK first, don't just go and do it and wait for me to yell at you. Cause, I can make your life a living misery XD I don't like copy write, it is ILLEGAL, oh and nvm that threat it was a jk XD. Anyways, back to the point, if you re going to use one of my ideas (this DOES apply to my idea book, well...maybe some of it)1- you MUST ask me first.2- wait for my reply BEFORE you make it.3- if I say no, DO NOT DO IT4- if I say yes, you MUST give me part credit.5- even if you change it up the SLIGHTEST bit, you must follow these rules.If I found out this happens again you will be banned.
You have been warned.
