Erin's POV
"Jordan! Stop it!" I laughed and screamed when he squeezed my sides and kissed me.
"Hmm!? Ha ha! No, I won't!"
"Jor--" I said before being cut of with a kiss.
"Good morning, cuteness." He said still grabbing my sides and tickling me to death.
"Good... ahh morning! Jesus, stop!" I screamed.
"Jesus? I'm Jesus now?" He asked.
"You know what I... meant! Stop!" I said.
"Stop what? What am I doing?" He asked.
"Jordan! Oh my god, I hate you! No I don't, I take that back!" I said.
"Ha, she can't even say she hates me in a playful way without feeling bad. That's so cute." He said still tickling me.
"Please! I'm gonna die, Jordan!" I said.
"Oh well, you're gonna die at some point anyway!" He said.
"Good?" I asked after kissing him.
"Not quite." He responded before grabbing my waist and kissing me untill I couldn't breath.
"You... you good now?" I asked after taking a moment to catch my breath.
"Oh, so close." He said before kissing me again.
"Good now? Not that I would want to stop." I said.
"Oh, are you good now?" He asked.
"No!" I said as if he should have known the answer.
Once we finally actually stood up, we got breakfast and I got ready for the day.
Jordan's POV
I didn't even know Erin brought all this stuff and then I walked into my bathroom, and it looked like she moved in. There was so much stuff in that bathroom.
"What the hell? Did you move in or something?" I asked.
"Basically, yeah." She said.
"Holy crap." I said still surprised how much stuff she thinks she needs to look good. I honestly think she could go without all of that and look just as good.
"What?" She asked.
"Don't ruin yourself with this crap, you look good without it." I said.
"Eww, no! Stop saying that." She said.
"Shut up, I love you every way you could be." I said as I walked up to her from behind and wrapped my arms around her waist.
"Thank you." She said after putting her hands on top of mine, closing her eyes and turning her head so she could kiss me.
"Not quite good yet." I said kissing her and holding the side of her head and her freshly curled, still slightly warm hair.
