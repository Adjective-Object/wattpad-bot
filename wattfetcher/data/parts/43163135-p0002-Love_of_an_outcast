When Aileen's shift ended we hurried home because it was getting dark and it's dangerous outside at night. We were walking a path that lead to our house and i felt like someone was watching us. We were halfway home when i heard a noise from a bush behind us, suddenly a dark creature appeared in front of us and grabbed me from my neck, forcing me to tilt my head upwards. I heard Aileen scream.
I tried to reach for my boot knife but couldn't, i saw the creature smirk. I closed my eyes tight and started to realize i was going to die. I felt it's breath on my skin and i was waiting for the pain to come but it never came. I heard a hiss and a thud. I opened my eyes and saw the creature on the ground with an arrow sticking out of it's head. I grabbed Aileen's hand and we ran home as fast as we could.
