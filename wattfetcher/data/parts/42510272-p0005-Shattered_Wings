~timeskip -Megans birthday-~(Megans pov) I groaned as I sat up in bed,my head pounding.I really shouldn't have drank so much last night. My door flew open and smacked the wall. I groaned again and held My head. "Megan, wake up. It's time for your special birthday breakfast!" it was my daddy (cas). "daddy, it's too early, f#ck off" he looked upset and slowly started to shut the door. I sighed and got up. His face brighteners up and he happily walked away. I made my way downstairs and into the kitchen. Everyone (jade,sam,lucifer,dean &cas) was there. "mornin megan, what do you want for breakfast?" "ICECREAM!" uncle moose, laughed and my dad instantly shook his head. "no way, that isn't a Breakfast megan" "but, you had pie on your birthday!""and?"I groaned."fine,pancakes"~timeskip~After we all finished eating we went to the living room and watched captain America. We had two big bowls of popcorn and glasses of tango.it was fun....normal. Well at least it was for a little while....We heard wings and turned around. Gabriel was stood behind the couch. "luci,I'm home~!""YOU DON'T LIVE HERE!""aw...don't be like that, megan. Ya know ya love me!" "the day I love you, is the day pigs fly!" I could hear jade laughing. She always found me and Gabriels 'arguements' hilarious. "what do you want, brother?""Im here with Megans gift,duh!" I held out my arms for my gift, the way a 5 year old holds up their arms when they want to be carried. He chuckled and handed me a box.inside was a bunch of sweets. YES! "and I'm taking the two lovely ladies to the bar tonight!""NO!" dad and uncle moose both protested immediately. "don't worry, they'll be fine!  They're with me!" lucifer facepalmed slightly. "thats why we're worried..."
