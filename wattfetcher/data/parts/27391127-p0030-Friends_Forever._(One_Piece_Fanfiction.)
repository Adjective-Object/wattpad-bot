Nothing good happens whenever a Celestial Dragon is present.

"The children." Queen Miriam said already with tears in her eyes.

"Go, find them." The King ordered his voice was firm and powerful but yet filled with worry, "Find our children They cannot and must not meet up with the World Noble."

Millie was scared. In the background, her siblings were there and they could do anything to save her. All they could've done was bow. After all, what were mere children.....
