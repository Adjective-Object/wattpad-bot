"You are what you love not who loves you"
Maybe I really am nothing      I've forgotten what love is      Passion is nothing      But an empty word
Suited for an empty person      With empty goals     Deflated futures      And a ruined mind
Just hoping to get out breathing     Cowering from my own hands      Just taking it in      Everything can change
Just like that
I am what I love I am a cipher
