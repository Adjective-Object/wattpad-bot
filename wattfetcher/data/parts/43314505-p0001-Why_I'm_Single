Arden Novak was your typical quirky socially awkward with a obsession with Netflix.
She spends hours and hours watching nurmurous shows and especially Doctor Who ( Which she has a ridiculous crush on ).
She only has two friends named Harper and Rachel who has had numerous boyfriends while Arden had none. Nadà.
Although , Arden was a geek and wore Harry Potter Sweat Shirts and spongebob undergarments she was indelibly gorgeous and turned down every boy that asked her out.
She always got questioned about her love life.
Her quotes were ; ❝ Why should get a boyfriend when I have Netflix ? ❞
Arden has commitment issues she doesn't believe in settling down with someone she thinks it's pathetic and ueless , ❝ dating a boy in high school would get you know where ❞
But she did and always gave advice to her best friends about their crushes and their love life.
Why Am I Single ?
Well I'll give you the answer to that read and find out and you'll know *Wink*
