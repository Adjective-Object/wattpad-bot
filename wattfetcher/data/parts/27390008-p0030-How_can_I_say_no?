"But you bought all that stuff and you spent a lot of time saving for it. Are you sure you want to just sell it?" He asked. I nodded.

"A lot of it was stuff my parents bought. I only bought my movies, cds, and posters. That's what I'm having her send over. It's no big deal." I shrugged. Johnny nodded. He took my hand and pulled me towards a room.

"Come on. I want to show you something. I think you'll love it." Johnny said. He pulled me inside a room and covered my eyes. "Ready?" He asked once we stopped walking.

"Yes. But I don't know what I'm ready for." I said. Johnny took away his hands. I gasped. Right in front of me, was the chair from Charlie and the chocolate factory. I looked around and saw the suit from public enemies. Turning around I saw different props from Johnny 's movies. I stood in awe. Johnny stood by the door trying to hide his smile. I turned towards him. "I thought you couldn't stand your own movies." I said. Johnny shrugged.

"Doesn't mean I can't have the props. I see you like it." He said. I nodded. I went over to him and wrapped my arms around him. I buried my head in his chest.

"I don't like it. I love it." I whispered. Johnny smiled and wrapped his arms around me. We stood there holding each other. I couldn't believe that I was so lucky to have a guy like him. I had finally moved in with Johnny.
