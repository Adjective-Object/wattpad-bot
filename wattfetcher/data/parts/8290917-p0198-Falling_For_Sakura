"You're going to be mine forever," she murmured under her breath softly, lovingly. No one was going to steal this baby from her. Thatâ€”she'd make sure of.
Once her satiety for the painting was fulfilled, she moved forward and scribbled her initial, S.T, on the bottom right hand side of the canvas.
"You're really done now," she said, satisfied with her initial claiming the painting. Then just to see what it'd look like on a wall, she lifted the canvas up and took it into the gallery at the front of the building.
"Where should I put you?" she asked herself a moment later, looking around the gallery with interest. "Ah!" She rushed over to the featured wall near the front of the counter where anyone who walked in would immediately see. There, she held it up and cocked her head to one side as she examined it with an artistic eye. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't quite see properly due to the fact that she was alone and couldn't possibly walk back to stand at a distance to properly inspect the painting. There was also the fact that her arms were quite short, and hence, she couldn't quite stand back to take a proper look either. Then she wondered if she should drill some holes in the wall and hang the paintings up just so she could take a good look at it. But it was getting rather late. She was tired, and she had to get up early tomorrow for the fashion event.
"Tomorrow morning," she said to herself. "I'll do it tomorrow morning." She'd rise early tomorrow and put it up just so she could see what it really look like. With that, she laid the painting on the floor, letting it rest against the wall. Then she rushed up the stairs, showered, and went to bed.
