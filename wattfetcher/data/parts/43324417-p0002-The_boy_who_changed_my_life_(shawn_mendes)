Shawn's P.O.V-----------------------------I just finished my concert in Calgary . I love my fans so much on how they support me.
I get a call from my manager saying I can go back home to Toronto, Canada to see my family for a year . I'm so excited to see my mom, dad and my 11 year old sister Aaliyah.
I also hope to meet some new friends around there to because most of them moved away or they lost contact with me after I became famous .
When I got home I spent a few hours with my family and decided to go on a walk to the park when I was walking towards a bench I saw this really skinny girl sleeping there , I felt so sorry for her so I woke her up to see if she was ok.
When I lightly shook her she saw me and her eyes went as big as plates, she quickly sat up and said " I .. I'm sorry I'll just get out of your way ". She ran off somewhere but when I looked back I didn't see her.
I thought to myself she is different I want to help her and I will.
