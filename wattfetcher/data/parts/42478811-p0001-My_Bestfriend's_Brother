I don't think anyone will even read this but oh wellüòÅAbby(My Best Friend):"Hailey, I don't know why your stressing over this, it's just a stupid exam!" Me:"It is not JUST AN EXAM!"Abby: "Ok, ok, calm down!" she says while holding her hands up defensively.Me: "Abbs I'm sorry. I'm just stressed ok?"Abby:"You know what you need?"Me: "What? And please don't say a sleep-"Abby: "A SLEEPOVER!!!!!!!"Me: "No I can't,Abbs, I need to study."Abby:"Nonsense! You are coming to my house tomorrow,WITHOUT STUDYING! Me: "No."Abby:"Yes, you are because,I already asked your mom and she said that's perfect because she and your dad have plans,and they didn't what to leave you and your brother at home alone!!" Me: "Well I guess I'm stuck at yours this weekend."(I said sarcastically)Abby:"Heck yeah you are!"Me: "But wait, what about Justin?"Abby: "Oh he's coming too; he'll hang out with my brother,Ansel!"Me: "Fiiiiiine I'll come."Abby:"Yay!!
