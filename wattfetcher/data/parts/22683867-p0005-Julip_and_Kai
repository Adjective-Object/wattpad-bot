Kai picked up the letter with tears in her eyes and it read,
Dearest Kai,I know what this looks like to you, but I assure you that, this isn't true, your father is on a very important business trip to Hawaii and I miss him very much and you know that. So I made sure to enroll you in a boarding school, I'm sorry. ....-mom
Kai ripped up the note and tossed it in the trash can. " Why did you do that ?" Julip asked, "My dad died..... and that heifer knew it!!!!!!!!!! She's a fricking lier!! "I'm sorry Julip, but can we go back to home/school? I'm to depressed for a girls night out. " Yeah let's go. ..." Julip said in a concerned voice. Julip and Kai left the house and headed back to school in their dorm. " Hey Julip, what's tomorrow?" Kai asked." With curiosity. " Ummmm Saturday, why? " " What do we do on Saturday nights?" " Well I go to poetry slams with Courtnie. " WTH?! Courtnie? That rude no good heifer? " " Hey, Courtnie is really nice ever since she broke up with the fabulous 3 they call themselves the pops. And threes only 1 person who is desperate enough to stay in that so called group is Kasondra. So yeah. " "Gv friend." "What did you say ?" Julip said with an ugly look in her face. "Gotcha Vibe... now I'm really tired so good night. " Kai said yawning. " whatever." Julip said turning the lamp light off.
