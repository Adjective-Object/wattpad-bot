By the time the movie was finished, Michael and Ashton were asleep, Typical. I sighed, carefully pushing Michael's head off my lap, and got up. I took one of the blankets and put it over Ashton, who seemed to be overjoyed by the gesture, grabbing it tightly.
I took the now empty cup and found my way into the kitchen. I touched the kettle on the stove, to feel that the water was still lukewarm. I poured some of it into the cup and found myself a bag of tea. I stirred the tea with a spoon, then carefully laying the spoon down, trying to make as minimal sound as I possibly could.
I leaned my back on the kitchen bench, looking out of the window and into the night. It had gotten dark outside, I mean, it was 10 PM. The street was empty, except for someone standing under a streetlight. The person, most likely a boy, was tall. Like, really tall, probably over 6 feet. The light above the person started to flicker, and he turned around to face Michael's house. He locked his eyes with mine, and smirked at me. At this point, I was terrified.
Then, I felt like my lungs were on fire. I couldn't breathe. I bowed down, trying to catch my breath. It didn't work. I looked up at the boy again, and I swear I could see his eyes turn black. The burning in my lungs became more intense, and I tried to scream. I couldn't. The cup slipped out of my hands and shattered into a thousand pieces on the floor. I dropped to my knees, grabbing my throat, struggling to stay conscious.
The cup must've woken the boys, because they ran into the room and was quickly my my side. "Oh my god, Lilith, are you alright?!" Michael panicked. I shook my head and pointed at the window.
Ashton got up and was just about to look outside, when I passed out.

When I woke up, I was in an unfamiliar bed. I sat up and it felt like someone dropped a tonne of brick on my head. "Finally, you're awake!" it was Michael's voice. He sat on a chair by the left side of the bed. "Where am I?" I groaned, rubbing my eyes. "The hospital. Do you remember what happened?" He scooted closer to the bed and held my hand. I thought for a moment, and it all came rushing back. The boy with black eyes. When he looked at me, I couldn't breathe.
I shook my head. I don't need Michael to think I'm insane. He smiled sympathetically at me, nodding. "You couldn't breathe. The doctors think it was related to how you felt earlier. By the way, how are you feeling now?" He asked, drawing circles at the back of my hand with his thumb. "My throat is dry," I creaked, but laughed slightly. "But otherwise, I'm good." He nodded, before getting up and lifting up a pile of clothes from the chair next to him. "I'll go buy you something to drink, OK? Then we'll get Ashton to drive us to your place." he spoke, handing me the clothes I borrowed from him. I nodded and gratefully took the clothes.

Michael's P.O.V
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I walked to the vending-machine and bought a box of Pepsi for Lilith. I decided against going back right away, so I want to the waiting-room instead. Ashton sat by a table, his chin resting in the palm of his hand. He was reading some comic. Typical Ashton. "Hey," I greeted him as I took a seat across of him. "Hi. How is she?" he asked without lifting his gaze from the comic. "She says she doesen't remember." I said seriously. This seemed to catch his attention, as his head snapped up, eyes wide.
"What?" he asked, clearly surprised. "How can she not remember?" he was completely lost. "I don't know." I sighed. "She could be lying." Ashton nodded and put the comic-book away. "Do you have any idea why they would be after her? She's not one of them, so we can cross that of the list." he asked, and I just shrugged. "I don't know, but I know that they're not going to get o her. She's our responsibility now. We have to protect her." Ashton nodded in agreement. "C'mon, she's probably wondering where we are." "Yeah," he said as we got up and walked back to Lilith's room.
