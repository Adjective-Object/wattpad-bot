"Sure but why do you " she stopped once she saw  at the top of the stairs looking down
" you don't like stairs do you "   she said
" no " I said shyly
" me too but I got used to them " she said
" I hope  I do too" I said
" talking about me"  justin said coming up behide me and wrapping his arms around my waist
" yeah totally " I said  sarcastically
" I. Caught the sarcasm" he said  glaring at me
" that was the point " I teased
" wanna  do something I'm bored " justin complained
"plus its raining" he added flopping on the couch
" I can fix dessert and y'all can put a movie on "   Pattie said walking off to the kitchen
" ok " I said walking over to the TV  and grabbing the remote and turning on Netflix
" Got so many features, tell the creatures just to beat it now
Fifty for the necklace, look down at my set list
Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest
Guess this, you ain't never ever on the guest list"
Justin sung then flipped through the movies while I just stared at him in shock then after a few minutes I broke the awkward silence
" you sing" I questioned shocked
" yeah and write  " he answered still flipping  through the movies then turning one on .
"  really I wanna hear more " I protestesd  taking the remote from him and  tossing the remote across the room then crossing my arms
Justin slid over to me and uncrossed my arms and kissed me softly and tucked a strand of hair behide my ear before he started singing
"I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished
You'd be the one for me
But never knew it'd get like this
Girl, what you do to me
You're who I'm thinkin' of
Girl, you ain't my runner up
And no matter what
You're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
