~Sabrina's Pov~
"sabrina get up sweetie!" my mom yells from outside my door.
"alright , im up"i say. "im going to go back to bed have a good day"! she says.__________________Im Sabrina Rae. i am 17 yrs. old. im a junior.i have blue eyes and brown hair.
Ever since i transfered here two years ago with my best friend Tristen, we became best friends with a girl named meghan.
Also we've been best friends with Jack Gilinsky, Sammy Wilkinson, and Jack Johnson. (they aren't famous yet in this book)
Jack, sammy, and jj are popular at our school because they play basketball, and they are our schools star players.
me and tristen  just got lucky they wanted to be friends with us.
none of the girls like us because we are best friends with them. im sensitive, i just act tough, so when people tell me stuff....it hurts._____________________i brush my teeth then i fix my hair up and leave it natural which is curly/wavy and put on my outfit. (girls outifts above)
I grab my Ray Bans and my bag, and head downstairs.
"Im leaving!" i yell grabbing the the keys and walking out the door.
i txt Tristen and Meghan and tell them im on my way to pick them up.
they live right next to each other, so it is so much easier for me.
i pull up outside their house and honk the horn.
they come out after like 5 min.
"Damn! Yall are so slow as fuck!" i yell laughing.
"shut up bitch!" Meghan yells laughing while Tristen and her get in the car.
"Hey yall want starbucks?" i ask. "do you even have to ask?" Tristen says texting on her phone.
"hey you've been on the phone since you got in the car, who ya texting?" i say looking over her shoulder.
she mumbles something but i couldnt hear it. "who?" i say.
"sammy" i heard her mumble. i smirk and say "who?"
"For fucks sake! Sammy! Sammy Mother Fucking Wilkinson!" she says trying not to laugh.
me and Meghan start laughing. "why you texting him?" i ask. "he was wondering where we were at?" she says.
"oh well tell them we will be there in 10"i say pulling into the starbucks drive thru.
"what do yall want?" i ask. "same as usual" Meghan says "yeah me too" Tristen says.
"good morning! welcome to Starbucks how may i help you?" a girl says through the speaker thing.
"can i have a caramel mocha on ice, and two vanilla bean frappucinos" i say.
"ok that will be 13.57, pull up to the second window to pay" i drove to the second window , and payed her and then drove up to the first window.
"did you order a caramel mocha on ice, and 2 vanilla bean frappucinos?" this really hot guy asked.he looked maybe 18.
i bit my lip and nodded. he smirked. "they will be right out" he said winking then closing the window.
"holy shit he is fucking hot" i say. "i saw the way he was checking you out" Meghan says smirking.
"here you go" he said opening the window and handing me the drinks. i give them to the girls and turn to the boy in the window.
