My phone buzzed again, "What now?" I asked Elina, she took my phone and read the text "The text says : Looks like you forgot about the kitten I gave you, you shall find it and feed it before it dies, it has been two days since I gave it to you and you forgot  it ! If you can't take care of a kitten, how can you take care of our little baby angels ... In future *wink*, S.A 6:00 pm" Elina's eyes widened with mine, "Where is it ! My mother will freak out if she knows there's a free cat in the house" Elina slapped herself, "I don't know, I really am late and I must go to my work, you look for it and find it, ask for Damon's help" I ignored her continuous whimpering and dressed for my work.
*At Stylish&Modest*

"YOU ARE 30 MINUTES LATE" The boss screamed, "Sorry, it's the first time and will be the last" I left to do my job and take money from people.
"You still owe me 10 dollars" A client woke me up from my deep thoughts, "I-I'm sorry, here you go" I drew a smile on my face as I gave him his money, "What is the pretty girl thinking of ?" I put my eyes on the tall figure in front of me, "Oh, hey Simon, please take a step to the left so I can serve the next client", "So, since when have you been working here ? If I knew earlier I would've come before" I smiled as I took money from the next client, "What are you doing here ? this place sells things for girls only, NEXT PLEASE", "I need your help" Simon said, my boss gave me a deadly glare, "Sorry, I'm not supposed to talk to clients and I'm already not used to chat with boys, NEXT", "But you already owe me for not letting you die" Simon put his hands in his pockets and smirked, I raised an eyebrow at him and he giggled, "As if I was going to die because of a little cut", "You still owe me something, when does your shift end ?" He combed his pretty hair with his hand, why is he so beautiful ? I may never know...
"Earth is calling Leena" Simon waved his hand in front of my face, "Okay, I'm off in two hours" I sighed and continued working. Simon jumped over the counter and stood beside me, "Move" Simon pushed me to the left, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING" I whispered\screamed, "I'm helping so you can finish early and help me. You do the math and take money from people, I will fold the clothes and put them in a plastic bag, simple" He smiled and a hole appeared in his cheek, HE HAS A DIMPLE ! RED ALERT ON !!! Stop Leena ! Stop it and concentrate, "No, you can't. If the boss sees you I'm done" The client standing in front of me coughed, "Sorry Miss, Those are 59,87 dollars" I ignored the guy standing beside me, "I guess you have no choice, plus, I saw your boss walking out" I eventually gave up and let him help me.
"47807,86 Dollars please" I said, "Gosh ! you're a genius, *whispers* Where do they get money from" Simon giggled and I did too, "Look who's talking ? Mr.I-wear-brands-from-head-to-toe-and-never-wear-the-same-clothes-twice" I commented, Simon exploded in laughter as he was putting the rich woman's clothes in the plastic bags, "Come on ! It's not like that" Simon stuck out his bottom lip, I chuckled, "Yeah yeah yeah ... 68 Dollars please" I told the customer, "No sales or discounts ?" She asked and Simon chuckled, I punched his arm slightly, "No madam, I'm sorry" I smiled at her, "Come on ! not even 10 dollars ?" She asked and Simon did his best to control his laughter, "I'm sorry, the prices are fixed, "How about ... I'll take 5 high-priced pieces and you'll give me the 6th piece for free", Simon bent and slid on the floor while laughing uncontrollably without being seen by anybody except me, "I'm really sorry but that's out of my qualifications" the woman sighed after she paid then left.
My shift ended after I had scolded Simon and gave him a lesson about respecting others and that not everybody can afford expensive clothes.
"You know what time is it ?" Simon asked and I shook my head in disagreement, "Ma lady, It's time for you to help meeeh" Simon knelt in front of me and tied his hands together in a begging form, "Hmmm, well, after thinking, my majesty will overlook your weakness and pathetic look and will agree to help you" I spoke with my head held high, "Shut up" Simon pulled a blouse from the shelf and threw it at me but I caught it professionally. Simon did the ninja's defensive position, "What do you want ?" I chuckled, "Put your weapon down first" He ordered and I giggled, "Okay" I folded the blouse and pushed it back into the shelf. "I'll be back in a minute" I went to change my outfit.
